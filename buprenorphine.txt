I'm in a predicament and looking for advice/opinions...\n\n\nMy last experience with the local drug snd alcohol service was postivive. They prescribed subutex. Unfortunately it would be daily pick up for 2 weeks to a month, which is not conducive to work.\n\nThey were nice people but they were more keen on a maintained dose of subutex rather than getting you off. Tbf, they followed the guidelines, I tested positive during the time with them for H and crack, so they won't even think of reducing until you are stable for 6 months....\n\nLong story short, I ended up in rehab after losing my Job and withdrew from a small dose of subutex, with no major issue at all. \n\nRehab worked for a bit but I've since picked up a dabble habit but in my mind I convince myself I need something after using either subs, Dec, or methadone....just something. I get these off the street and pay for them.\n\nShall i bite the bullet and go back to the local drug servixe, subutex would be prescribed so aa lot cheapper but it then becones official. Ok they dont tell work. But im on the books amd have the shame of going back when the last time they saw me they knew i was going to a good rehab, so woukd have that shame....even if the same people may no longer work there.\n\nI'm worried about 2 things:\n\n1. Subutex maintenance....no desire to taper you off quickly. Which actually is probably the right approach. Submit several clean samples then we can talk about a slow reduction \n\n2. It's on the books. Daily pick ups, not conducive to my work. I can work from home a few days a week but the days I'm in London how will I collect? \n\nSome positives: I'm not buying subs,dhc, methadone off the streets. Saving money and not seeing unscrupulous people\n\nA commitment to keep going so that eventually abstinence sticks....I can't keep dabbling forever.....\n\nAny thoughts or advice? \nThanks in advance!",

        "post_content": "@squirejim I'm wondering exactly what you mean by dabbling? To me dabbling is occasional use, infrequently enough that you don\u2019t develop a physical dependency.\n\nIf you\u2019re not feeling withdrawal when you aren\u2019t using, I wouldn\u2019t get on buprenorphine maintenance, nor would I even see a need to do a quick taper. So I can only assume you\u2019re physically addicted, and using the word dabbling a little differently than I would.\n\nAnyway, to address one observation, YES it does get worse each time you go back on buprenorphine. It used to be so bad for me that it would take a week for me to really stabilize on subutex or suboxone - didn\u2019t matter which one. I\u2019m on methadone now, tapering off.\n\nCan you just quit cold turkey? What happens?\n\nAlso, regarding clinic daily visits, can you go to a private doctor for buprenorphine? A private doctor is more expensive but more flexible and will let you have more take homes quicker.",

I am not physically dependent any more as the last two months i tapered myself down to not taking anything daily for a month. I then used the last 8 pills i had across a two to three week span for a decent buzz. Started insufflating a quarter of a pill 2 times a day for about 4-5 days and then stepped up to a half to continue the desired effect. And shortly ran dry. I have received my script for the month and turned too plugging a solution with up to 3/4 of a pill for the desired effect. Only when i jumped up to 3/4 of a pill did i notice any effect again. To make the most of what i have left how long should i wait before dosing again? Its really hard not to not have the addict mentality of doing drugs even if im not getting high from it. But i think i can fight it. So how long before i could allegedly snort and feel lets say 1/3 of a pill? Any advice or opinions welcome. Stay safe, stay high and stay blessed brethren.",

TBH, I am quite comfortable on the suboxone in as far as I am managing to stay off more dangerous street drugs, and I am stable enough to lead a productive life and do the things I want to do. The one problem, and it is a big problem - My sex drive. My libido is pretty much at zero, and as I am in a relationship, this is not good at all. My partner has been very patient over the last few months. I lost my sex drive about 6 or more months ago after a period of repeated lapses on heroin and crack. Every time I got clean for a while, my sex drive would just start to creep up, but then I would go and blow it all with another relapse. The reasons behind my pattern of relapsing are irrelevant - I am addressing this seperately. But in order to stabilize my lifestyle, I went on a suboxone maintenance script. Its great as far as my individual life is concerned, but it is affecting my partner big time. We have not had sex for months, and he is getting so frustrated now, emotionally as well as sexually. He thinks that I don't fancy him anymore. Sometimes he getsd ideas that I'm cheating, I dont love him etc etc. I love my partner and I want things back to normal between us, but the only way this is gonna happen is if I get off the suboxone and stay clean. I am hoping to go into detox very soon and clean up, and all the aftercare will be arranged for me etc. I wanna get clean, but I'm scared that I'm doing it more to save my relationship than I am for me. If I was single, I think I'd stay on suboxone for a while longer. I start my 2nd year at college next week, and the detox is gonna interrupt the beginning of my curricular year. Not just the time I spend in the detox centre, but the time it takes for my poor brain to recover after I come out. I am also on diazepam, only a low dose, but I don't think its that which is causing the libido problem. I'm not sure though. In some ways I think the diazepam will help me deal with some of the longer term suboxone withdrawal symptoms, and they certainly help me with my anxiety. I just don't know what to do for the best. My partner has been patient with me long enough, I wouldn't expect him to wait much longer before he decides to walk away from me. And that scares me. The pressure I feel under is hard to cope with. I just don't know what to do.",

You guys can always do other things that will still let he/she know that you still care about them. But it's really important that you make these decisions for you, and not for other people. \nIt's hard getting sober, but staying sober is a lifelong battle.....\nThe is Just my opinion. I hope you and your partner work things out...",

But if it's missing, it can cause all sorts of problems. I agree totally with the above poster who says that it's far preferable to be stable and have no sex life, than be on street gear, with all the dangers due to that high risk lifestyle, and be as horny as your average bunny. Sex is not just about the physical act of having intercourse, its a way to show love, and you do that with foreplay. I think perhaps your boyfriend feels unloved because you don't have intercourse, but you can employ foreplay to take it's place for a while.\n\nWhat about showing him just how much you care, by pampering him? Run him a bath, get some exotic massage oil or even Johnsons baby oil (make sure you warm it in a glass of hottish water) and give him a sensual massage. That can be finished of with oral sex, or just a hand job. He'll still feel cared for and loved. Perhaps make it a thing that you do if you see that he's feeling down, cos it would also cheer him up a lot, I imagine.\n\nYou know I always found that with my ex, if I showed him more attention, touching a lot (I'm very tactile) going out of my way to get something nice that he liked to eat, or just snuggling up in front of a good porn movie at night. Cos after all, if he was supporting me when I had my \"clean spells\" I was gonna make damn sure he knew I appreciated it. Sex toys help as well, My ex told me that some of his best orgasms occurred when we used \"toys.\" \n\nI think for most people, it is all of the touching and stroking that goes on before intercourse that shows them that we love them, intercourse is just the way we finish it off. Yeah, I know intercourse can be bloody special in it own way, but compensate by making what would normally be foreplay \"special.\"\n\nJust explain to him that he's gonna have to wait a little longer, that you really appreciate him, but at the moment you couldn't get horny if your life depended on it. Tell him how important this is to you, to both of you, and just ask him to be patient for a little longer. There are more ways to show you love someone in a sexual way than with intercourse.\n\nI hope this helps some, perhaps a little minx called \"girlie\" will be along soon. She'll know (in detail) just what you'd need to do. Personally I think the sexiest thing you can do is get him to tell you his fantasies and then act them out. Always worked for me, I know I may be 56, but I ain't dead.\n\nSparkles.:vibes:",

It is an antidepressant that effects dopamine and norepinephrine but because of its effects on dopamine it is known to have no sexual side effects and in fact can INCREASE libido of people who are lacking it. I used it in the past when he was in the same situation but the other end of it and it was physically impossible to have sex with his girlfriend. This worked wonders and in fact helped with other mental problems (depression) he had at the time. Also it may just take more to get You going and what not. This may be getting to personal but is it just the drive to do it or is she physical effected to such as not getting wet down there and that kind of stuff. Someone may just need to make more of an event out of it such as candles, taking a hot bath together, massaging each other and all that good stuff. It actually was great for SWIM in the end because he was able to last forever so he could finish his girlfriend several times and then when he finally finished it was amazing. Good luck and it can certainly be frustrating but I know that if his girlfriend had these problems he would wait forever for her because he loves her very much and while sex is extremely important to healthy relationships and actually a healthy life and mood, it is not everything in life or a relationship.",

I know that, especially when I was on psych meds (this being before I got older & had hormonal changes that make me randy all the damn time), I often wouldn't want to initiate sex, that I almost wanted to turn away if my husband tried to initiate it with me.\n\nBut I have to say, many times when I started out with the mindset of \"doing it just to get through it so he'll be happy\", it didn't take too long before I was really into it myself.\n\nIf you guys have anal intercourse, this might be harder to go along with (being the punter might be an issue, erection-wise, if you're not into it & being the receiver and not being into it can be exceptionally painful!), but if you two are more into oral (or go back & forth between the two), it can be easier. You might not be in the mood initially, but once y'all start making out & such, you might feel more up for it. And if not...well, some people might not agree with me, but I'd say 'take one for the team', as it were, & give him head. But don't do this so often that you form a huge resentment towards him, because that's no fucking good either!\n\nBut, like I said, often, if I sort of went along with it, it would get me in the mood. And sometimes I just did it because I knew it was really a small thing that could make him very happy.\n\nI have to say, it's very very very important that you keep up the physical affection. The breakdown of my marriage wasn't a lack of sex (although we didn't really have any for the last 6 years of the marriage), it was a lack of intimacy. We eventually stopped sleeping next to each other in bed (although he joined me in sleeping in the living room after a couple years), and then the regular hugs & kisses & hair ruffling as one walked by the other...when THAT stuff stopped, the relationship really broke down.\n\nThe sex itself isn't as important as the intimacy.\n\n~Kailey",

One tries to take the rest no later than 4 more hours. Then waits at least another 4 hours before dinner.\nThis works for one person.

        "post_content": "Eleven years ago I was put on buprenorphine to deal with a heroin addiction. I stayed on it for 2 years at 8mg a day. My first attempt at quitting saw me jump off at 8mg with no taper. I lasted three months, but the PAWS were interfering with my ability to finish up school. I decided to go back on at 2mg a day. After I finished school, approximately 10 months later, I jumped off again, at 2mg, no taper. It was absolute hell for 6 months, but I made it through. \n\n\nSince ceasing buprenorphine therapy I've never felt right. Sleep has been a serious issue, as has a growing dark depression and anxiety disorder. For the past 7 or 8 years I've been seeing psychiatrists, psychologists, addiction medicine specialists, been put on various ssri's, snri's, anti-psychotics and various other meds, and been involved in AA. Nothing seems to help, some things/meds make it worse.\n\n\nAbout a year and a half ago I began using heroin again, sporadically. Initially I kept it on the fringes, no more than once a week, and very small doses. Gradually I began to use more and more, and though I never developed another daily habit, I would experience mild to moderate acute withdrawal symptoms after using a couple of days a week. I would get through these withdrawal periods using other meds. \n\n\nIt's currently been about 5 weeks since I've last used, and I continue to experience some serious PAWS...no sleep, severe depression and anxiety, etc. I'm considering going back on buprenorphine at a very small dose, and staying on it for the foreseeable future. I believe it would go very far in alleviating my depression, anxiety, insomnia, and improve my overall quality of life. My first time around with bupe I was in my mid 20's, I'm now in my mid 30's. I hesitate to go back on this med because I know how ridiculously difficult, nearly impossible, it is to quit. However, I don't intend to quit again, barring severe unforeseen side effects developing. I'm currently on moderately large doses of Gabapentin and Lyrica, both of which I'm very physically dependent on. Lyrica withdrawals are as horrible or worse than opioid and/or benzo w/d's. I believe the burprenorphine would go far in assisting coming off of these other meds, meds that have brought unwanted side effects.\n\n\nI apologize for the long post, but I would greatly appreciate any input you all may have on this matter: Should I go back on buprenorphine? All opinions are welcome!",

        "post_content": "Hello and welcome to the forum!\nThis is not an easy question to answer but as you know the risks and addiction potential of buprenorphine, then it is up to you to weigh up those risks against the depression you suffer from and make a calculated, informed decision. \n\nGoogle \"ALKS 5461\". A drug is currently in trials which contains Buprenorphine and samidorphan, a mu-opioid (MOR) antagonist. This combination is designed to maximize the antidepressant KOR effects of buprenorphine while counteracting its addictive potential with samidorphan\u2019s MOR activity. (That was a quote from the a 'Forbes' news article.) Unfortunately this drug has just failed a clinical trial due to a positive reaction in the Placebo group. However, this is not unusual and many other drugs have undergone more extensive testing due to the same reason. It is being marketed both as an antidepressant but also as treatment for Cocaine dependency. I don't see how it could help people with a Cocaine addiction but as an anti-depressant, i hope it will work. \nI am hoping that this drug makes it to market as I would gladly try it out! \n\nI have suffered from Treatment Resistant Depression for as long as I can remember. I am currently on Buprenorphine after a Heroin binge a few years ago. I tried coming off Buprenorphine a year or so ago and the crushing depression made me relapse and get back on Bupe. It took me a while to realize it but my mood has stabilized whilst on this medication. I had some life circumstances that caused me to be upset and depressed but I now know that my reaction was 'normal' and not the same as the severe depression i had felt in the past. \n\nI am currently taking 1.6mg of Buprenorphine but had got as low as 0.2mg in the past and felt as good on that low dose as I did on 24mg. I am now in the position where I am having to decide whether to jump off when I get to 0.2mg, or try and stay on it for the sake of my mental health. My personal opinion is that if I had of been given Buprenorphine instead of one of the many anti-depressants the Doctors threw at me, I would be happy to have found a drug that works for me. But having to deal with a 'Drug addiction service' and the stigma attached is a factor in me wanting to quit. \n\nIt's a controversial subject but if I could get a low dose of Buprenorphine prescribed as an anti-depressant, I would probably take it for the rest of my life. \n\nGood luck :vibes:",

This is not a decision I take lightly; I'm soliciting as much information and as many opinions as possible prior to making it. My addiction therapist has been pushing hard for burprenorphine. However, within the recovery community, for every positive take on this med, there is an equally negative one. My experience, many years ago, was rather positive (constipation not withstanding). I chose to make an attempt at living med free...that did not work out. I'm at peace with knowing I'll be taking some kind of med for the rest of my life, the decision now is which one...",

It is an opioid and might alleviate the PAWS you are experiencing, sufficient enough to allow you to live your life without being dependent on more potent opioids. \n\nBut, at this stage, I would do what feels right to you and going on a stable dose of Buprenorphine long term sounds alot better than having to suffer through the horrible PAWS, and going back and forth with heroin. It's a vicious cycle.\n\nIt sounds as though you know the pros and cons of getting back on Buprenorphine and it does sound like the best option.\n\nGood luck!",

The problem is I would have to redose frequently throughout the day or suffer very real opioid withdrawal symptoms. It is something I will look into more, as it may be a better option than buprenorphine maintenance, and perhaps if it does not work, I can then switch over to bupe.\n\nIs kratom something you currently take? You mentioned you can relate to my experience, is buprenorphine something you used to, or are now, taking? Would you mind elaborating on your experience, I would really like to hear what you have to say.\n\nThanks!",

        "post_content": "Kratom could be an option! I have a friend who used it to beat withdrawal symptoms when jumping off both Heroin and Suboxone. He said that it eliminated 80% of the symptoms but he didn't suffer from depression. I use Kratom to ease the minor withdrawals when dropping to a lower dose and it works great.\n\nWhat type of Kratom do you have that comes in a bottle? If you take a look over in the Kratom section you will find lots of useful info there. It's really important to buy your Kratom from a trusted source. Extracts and liquids are generally not the best way to buy the stuff and the strain of Kratom is important when used for Opiate withdrawals. 'Head shops' are best avoided and you should look for vendors who just sell Kratom in plain leaf form. Avoid those that give it silly names like 'super enhanced' etc. 'Maeng Da' is marketed as stronger and it's priced accordingly. In My experience It is most often not any stronger than the regular strains and I avoid it. \n\nRed Vein Borneo is the best for relieving Opiate withdrawal symptoms and I would start with some of that if I were you. A lot of vendors sell selection packs with a little amount of a few different strains and that might be a good idea - so you can try a few and see what you think. Red Borneo It is the most sedating and Opiate like of the different strains. I miss the energy boost I get from Buprenorphine though and so I blend the Red Vein Borneo with Green Malay, which is more energising. Kratom addiction is very real though and you will end up addicted if taken daily. However, withdrawals are generally not as severe as coming off Opiates. But, everyone is different. I used Kratom daily, going up to a fairly large amount (20 - 25gms), before tapering to around 10gms and then stopping after a few months. I didn't experience much, if anything in the way of withdrawals but a different person takign the same amount may experience them significantly. It's a strange plant that way!\n\nI find that a 5gm dose of Kratom lasts most of the day. When I built up more of a tolerance, I dosed twice a day. This was whilst still on Buprenorphine. I took it to see what it was like in preparation for quitting Bupe and then had a pain management issue that it helped, and I just kept on takign it as I enjoyed the feeling. I take it occasionally now but not daily as I don't want to build up a tolerance. It's a great plant (Tree) but lots of places are banning in so you'll have to take that into account before making up your mind about potentially using it long term. \n\nI would say that it's definitely worth a try before you jump into takign Buprenorphine \n\nI hope you're keeping well :vibes:",

I don't see why you would be met with opposition for the reasons stated. There are dodgy vendors out there but finding Kratom that is properly cultivated and distributed is really not that hard. You can get some good advice on that in the Kratom section. Source discussion is not allowed but you can get pointers on what to look out for and avoid when looking to buy the stuff. \nAvoid extracts, capsules and resins. \nAvoid sellers who also sell bongs and other crap. \nLook for a vendor who sells plain leaf Kratom only and you will likely be fine. \n\nIf you find the 'Toss and wash' method too hard to get down, try making tea. There are instructions in the Kratom section. That was my preferred method when using regularly. I'd make a batch of tea that was enough for 5 days and store it in a plastic bottle in the fridge. It doesn't taste nice but you can reduce the liquid so that you have as much as 10gms in half a cup of liquid. Drink it down in one go and hold your breath, then chase it with a glass of fresh orange and it's done in seconds and you hardly notice the taste. \n\nYou can get sample packs very cheaply and I would say, what have you got to lose?",

Do you feel it is as effective, or is affecting you any differently, this time around? Most who come off of buprenorphine and don't feel as though they've returned to \"normal,\" turn back to the medication within a year. You are the first person, aside from myself, who has suffered for several years before facing this decision. Of course, there are those who believe maintenance on any medication is a complete befoulment of one's life. A position I find completely baffling...a life in which you are able to participate appears far \"cleaner\" and more desirable than one spent in fear. I suppose I could envy those who simply don't understand that statement.\n\nOne more question, jumping off at 2mg, did you find the extended acute and post acute withdrawal periods as difficult as I did?",

        "post_content": "It's been a while since I started this thread, and I wanted to update it.\n\nI still haven't made the commitment to buprenorphine. I did relapse briefly with heroin, for only a few days. The most time I've been able to put together is about 6 weeks. I believe I precipitated the relapse by attempting to reduce my dose of both lyrica and gabapentin too quickly, leading to withdrawal symptoms, which brought on the relapse. I'm very sensitive to both of those medications and have had a very difficult time reducing my dose. \n\nAfter my relapse, my opioid withdrawal symptoms were fairly acute...more than I was expecting or prepared for. I ended up taking 1mg of buprenorphine to deal with it. This helped, although I felt guilty for giving in and taking it. The constipation that followed was ridiculous. I took a dose of miralax that day...nothing. I took a double dose of miralax and 200mgs of colace the following day...still nothing, that day or the following day. It wasn't until 72 hours after that small dose of buprenorphine, and all of the laxatives mentioned, that something finally happened. This is another reason I've continued to try to remain completely opioid free, maybe my most pressing concern at this point. Constipation was always an issue for me while taking subutex in the past, however this is beyond anything I experienced prior. I've read and been told that both lyrica and gabapentin can be constipating as well. \n\nSo here I am, months after posting my dilemma, in basically the same place. I do have a new psychiatrist, with whom I'm trying even more antidepressants...but it's difficult to delineate between the the underlying depression and the depression brought on by the post acute withdrawal I've been experiencing. However, as I stated above, there's a strong underlying depression, and most all anti-depressants I've tried in the past few years bring on feelings of intense anxiety, sweating, etc...\n\nOne additional medication I've been prescribed is baclofen, a gaba-b agonist. I use it sparingly, as it is very addictive from what I've read. It helps a bit with anxiety, and a lot with sleep.",

Then once I jumped low enough down I got some kratom and did the toss and wash method for roughly 2 weeks until it ran out. It really helps to plug your nose when drinking it lol\n\nI was at 1mg of bupe for about a year and then went from that to a speck in just a short month. \n\nI have been on subs for a solid 6 years of my 35 yo life and addicted to opiates for 15 years. Been through it all just to chase a high. Done just about everything to get the shit. Been to jail. Prison. Rehab. Halfway houses. AA. \n\nSegway : Smart recovery\n-if AA/NA didn\u2019t work for you do yourself a favor and research smart recovery - you can attend in person meetings or via zoom and it\u2019s all about finding the inward strength inside of one\u2019s self instead of relying on a supernatural power and admitting to being powerless over something I\u2019m definitely not powerless to - don\u2019t get me wrong I\u2019m all about that supernatural power but in regards to addiction I needed immense help learning how to go about regulating my feelings, behaviors, and emotions.\n\nI realized that I was never going to stop using subs and kidding myself that I wasn\u2019t a full blown junkie. I was also taking Xanax and told myself uppers were terrible but that didn\u2019t stop me from using them every once in awhile. I\u2019ve learned that I probably have a pretty severe case of ADHD most likely which causes me to want more dopamine and I feel as if bupe has hijacked my ability to live a happy and healthy life.\n\nThe headaches. The constant depression. I have no energy. No motivation. Nothing. And I feel the same way I did taking subs! Crazy. \n\nLuckily I have a great wife who supports me and has always wanted me off this garbage. I\u2019ve been clean now for almost 2 months but it feels more like 2 years. \n\nI understand now that sometimes the highs in my life make me want to use more so than the lows. I talk myself back into addiction by making whatever it is an option by saying things like \u201cyou\u2019ll feel better\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019ll actually want to spend time with your wife and kids if you take something\u201d \u201cyou\u2019ll feel normal\u201d but I know better.\n\nUnderstand that your body and mind play tricks on you. Ask lots of questions. google is your friend. Don\u2019t always trust doctors. They are humans just like you and I. Do your own research. Research the facts and try not to catastrophize everything too much. Give yourself time and space to grieve the loss of a friend - addiction. although it was a really shitty friend, it was still always there for me in times of need. I also had to grieve the me I thought I would be at 35 and realize that God wants me where I\u2019m at right now in this moment. Even if I feel like ass. \n\nIm right where I need to be. So although I\u2019m in pain and mildly irritated constantly and live in anxiety hell - I know that this too shall pass.. eventually. Hopefully. Lol. \n\nI haven\u2019t gotten to one day at a time just yet - I\u2019m moment by moment. But for this moment right now, I choose not to use. That\u2019s all I can hope for.",

        "post_content": "@Floridastatebulldog Very nice post! I can relate to everything you mentioned, including about SMART Recovery and needing to learn how to manage your emotions, feelings, and behaviors.\n\nConsider writing more with a recovery journal: https://drugs-forum.com/journal/ I\u2019m afraid this post of yours might get buried in this buprenorphine thread. You can ask an admin to move it to the opiate addiction section by reporting it as misplaced.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult and extremely unpleasant to go through an addiction but if there\u2019s any silver lining, it\u2019s that you end up learning a lot about yourself and how to better handle everyday stress. I personally feel like I have a more balanced outlook and frame of mind when challenges arise now that I\u2019ve been to SMART recovery, an addiction doctor who prescribed me buprenorphine, recovery yoga and for the past two and a half years, a methadone clinic. I had a good counselor for the first two years and learned a lot from him about redirecting my thoughts away from heroin and toward other ways to relieve anxiety when something triggered me. It took a while but eventually I stopped craving heroin.\n\nCongratulations on making it through all the physical and emotional withdrawals to get to the other side and off even your maintenance meds. Two months is still early for a long-acting opioid like buprenorphine. Give yourself more time to regain your energy, strength and motivation. For me, the best way to regain motivation is to do stuff I know I enjoy even if I really don\u2019t feel like doing it at all. I think you need to remind yourself how enjoyable it is to be active.\n\nYou mentioned you feel the same way you did on buprenorphine, with regard to depression, headaches and lack of motivation. Buprenorphine made me feel incredibly depressed and unmotivated, with severe anhedonia, no pleasure from anything at all. I felt like there was an empty pit in my heart and soul if that makes any sense. I hated it so much. That\u2019s why I ended up on methadone. Anyway, I think buprenorphine blocks all your pleasure receptors so you don\u2019t feel euphoria from opiates or anything else for that matter. Your receptors are still healing, getting back to baseline, so maybe that is why you\u2019re still feeling depressed the way you were on buprenorphine.\n\nI wish I had advice on how to overcome that depression. Time is probably the answer. You stuck it out so long on buprenorphine, despite those feelings so I imagine you have some strategies. \n\nI\u2019d just be damn happy to be off opiates and not have to worry about that shit anymore! Maybe ponder that grand accomplishment when you\u2019re feeling down?!",

        "post_content": "Okay to give you guys kind of a background on the past 5 years of my life. I've been on/off opiates, mostly hydro, and oxycodone. But also OxyContin and tramadol (coming off this was hell). In 2008 I got in a very serious car accident breaking both femurs, ribs lung collapsed, in the hospital for over a month. I was on opiates for 5 months but was weaned properly by Pain Management, experienced Withdrawals for 3 days nothing horrible to where I wasn't able to do normal activities. It wasn't until jan 2011 when I had titanium rods removed from my femurs from the initial breaking them in 2008. And I was put on hydro 7.5 50 of them a week I'd go through, that lasted for 4.5 months and I went CT. A week of hell from that. Then July 2011 sent to pain management for chronic pain in my legs from the surgeries, severe amounts of scar tissue on so-forth. Went to pain management and put on good ol tramadol.. Oh yeah non addictive my ass! I was on that Til feb 2012 and quit CT.. Way worse than anything from hydro.. I was off for 3 WEEKS.. Then tore my shoulder and back to hydro I went.. And oxycodone.. Taking way more than I ever have in my life each day, and also had access to tramadol. That went from march-June.. Finally enough was enough... I started going to a psychiatrist due to personal issues I have had throughout my life. He put me on suboxone. A total of 15 strips with one refill for 10 if needed. I was taking 6mg a day. Well I was on for 16 days and weaned from 6mg Til 2mg.. And last dose was Sunday night (7-8-12) now its Wednesday .. So tonight will be 72 hrs with none.. I know the long half life of 36 hrs.. I started feeling Withdrawals around 12pm yesterday .. Nothing like tramadol or hydro.. Just wondering if the worse is yet to come or since I was only on it for such a short period of time should I be okay by Friday? I figure today and tomorrow would be the worst days. I just can't take off anymore work.. It's hard to function feeling this way. I have xanex and Valium to help sleep.. And it really does help. I haven't had really any insomnia like I did from previous opiate WD, but like we all know the half life of this is 5x longer than oxys or hydro. I'm feeling hot/cold sweats achey bones/muscles, depression, anxiety. I plan to jog some later today when it\nCools down some, been drinking Gatorade and water to flush my body, and taking a good multivitamin. Am I close to some with all this? Or worse is yet to come? I looked everywhere on here for people using this short term but most people is at least 2 months on subs at higher doses. I was on for 16 days and the most I took in a day was 12mg.. But weaned to 2mg and took 2mg for 3 days before stopping.\n\nThank you guys so much, I can't wait to be clean from all these opiates and live life again.\n\nSbassler1157 added 1190 Minutes and 17 Seconds later...\n\nWell from yesterday to today I feel a TON better. Still achey, but ibuprofen and tylenol seem to be helping out with that. Still no Diarhea throughout any of this, if anything constipated from from the subs. Headache is gone.. Only thing really kicking my ass right now.. And is winning pretty well is how incredibly lethargic I feel. I feel as if I've been run over by a bus. But I'm back to work today after missing two days. Seems to keep my mind off how I'm feeling which is nice. Although I really have ZERO energy to do anything. I couldn't imagine being on it any longer and coming off this stuff. They key is be on it for a short as possible and quick taper. Two days of feeling like I have a bad flu I'll take over feeling the way I did detoxing off hydros CT. Hopefully it's almost over. I seriously feel for anyone who has been on this for a long time. Hang in there people it does get better. And you will have a normal life again. And have feelings again. So mostly now is just lethargy and anxiety/depression which runs in my family as it is. I pray to god I never have something happen to me again that will cause me to need opiates for pain. I went for a run yesterday did 1 mile and that helped tremendously. Even if you can't run get outside and walk around it helps, along with TONS OF WATER AND GATORADE!!",

During this time, you might want to get clonidine from your doctor, it will help with the restless leg syndrome (RLS). \n\nAs far as the cravings, you just have to find other things to fill your time with, like goal setting, working, accomplishing goals < huge one gives a nice release of natural opiates (endorphins), sex, love, happy feelings, music!!!, you get the picture. \n\nHere is one thing that worked great for me:\n\nFake it till you make it. Basically I just started acting cheerful and happy even when i felt crappy, and without even realizing it, I'm that way all the time now. A bit of a disappointment when I first realized it because I had somewhat of a reputation for being reclused / easily disturbed, but that's wayside now.",

Well I did it exactly the same way that you did and I found the Withdrawals to be minimal in comparison to heroin or methadone WD. What you need now is something to focus on, as opposed to focussing on how PAWS feels. You see recovery is not just about quitting your DOC, its all about a change in lifestyle. You have to work out a way to change from a drug using mindset to a non drug using mindset. I found college, studying for an access to higher education diploma worked for me. To be honest I had little time to even think about using. I made new friends, friends who didn't use, and I set up a whole new social scene with activities that were connected to the degree I wanted to study the following year. Now I know that education wouldn't be everyone's cup of tea, I just gave it as one of many examples, but you have to find something that rocks your world, something that will motivate you. This make sense love?\n\nSparkles.:vibes:",

I have a lot of stuff to keep my mind occupied mainly with playing guitar. It's really taken over a ton when I'm feeling down which is just about all the time. The RLS is quite a bitch and I really hate that over anything ESP at night. And to add on top of all this I totally screwed up somethin special I had with a girl due to these stupid ass drugs.. I've known her for 9 years finally get tw opportunity this past spring.. And not\nBeing myself from all these opiates screwed it up. All the lies and everything that comes along being on this stuff hurt her to point not even talking to me. I see light at the end of\nThe tunnel but I'm feeling pretty down and depressed right now.\n\nSbassler1157 added 4 Minutes and 28 Seconds later...\n\nOh and another thing I'll be heavily involved in is exercise. Before all this I was really into Crossfit. And am starting again next week. I want the ass kicking to keep my mind off opiates.. And to produce endorphins which I so badly need naturally produced again. It's so funny you think back to right before you start your DOC and think..\"hey just this one night I'll pop 50mg of whatever\"... Stupid thinking on my part.. Then completely addicted.",

        "post_content": "Well done sweetheart, your journey, and more importantly how you're dealing with it, is an inspiration for anyone who is considering quitting. The idea of riding it out, of going with it rather than fighting against it, makes it so much easier. As far as the aches and pains you're feeling, try not to worry, its quite normal to experience these. I believe that when we're not \"numbing up\" with opiates and we're in touch with all of our emotions again it hits us hard, almost like our nerves are raw. There's also a lot of feelings that have been suppressed whilst we were using, so its not at all unusual to find ourselves laughing like a maniac one minute, then crying like a child the next. Personally I found the most prevalent emotion that resurfaced when I quit using heroin, was anger. I didn't act on it most of the time as it really wasn't appropriate to do so, and in all honesty I knew that all sorts of feelings were gonna surface so I just did what you're doing, I went with them. When you're in wd you can't always trust that what you're feeling is appropriate for the situation you're in. As I said before, when you no longer have that soft cosy (emotional) padding (that opiates provide) between you and reality, its incredibly easy to get in touch with your emotions. Lastly, don't forget that some days you are gonna feel lethargic, your job is gonna feel like its more demanding than you can cope with, but if you asked them, you'll find that most of your colleagues feel exactly the same way. We all have \"off days\" love.\n\nSparkles. :vibes:",

        "post_content": "Well.. Back here again... Got my wisdom teeth out the beginning of January.. And got put in perc 7.5s ended up with 3 dry sockets to go along with that, and for anyone that doesn't know what they are. It's when the blood clot that forms where the tooth is pulled goes bye-bye.. Honestly so extremely excruciatingly painful, and to have 3 at the same time.. It was miserable. So my oral surgeon gave me 36 7.5 oxys to begin with, and 24 10mg hydros and one more refill of the oxys 36ct. Plus blew through 60tramadol too.. My sister sprained her wrist pretty bad and not having health Ins I gave her about 15 of the oxy to help with pain.. She doesn't abuse.. It's quite funny to see someone get high off of one oxy 7.5. And takes me about 5-6 of them to do that. But anyways I had some subs left over and wanted to use one 8mg strip to by-pass any wds from all the opiates I blew through in a month. But of course.. That turned into 2.5 weeks on subs and taking a total of 3.5 of them.. I finished off yesterday at 3:45pm with .25mg.. I learned a little from last time when I jumped off at 2mg that was NOT advised haha. So I somewhat tapered the last week.. From 1mg for 2 days .5mg 2 days and .25mg 3 days. I can already feel the effects which I'm sure is still from the .5 to .25 drop since bupe has the super long half life.. I don't expect it to be anywhere near as bad as last time. And although I was still able to function last time.. It was still miserable. I have about 15 Valium 10mg (I don't have any sort of issues with benzos) and also I have a few adderall. I've taken it before and it gives you the little kick in the butt for energy when you have none due to wds.. I know the next 5-6 days will be pretty crappy. But the price we pay for being addicts.. I told myself for about 3 weeks before the surgery I will NOT become addicted I will NOT put myself in that zombie state again, and have to deal with wds... Who are we trying to fool?? As soon as that \"high\" hit again... It felt so good and although I was in legit pain.. Taking 2 at the most would have taken the pain away. I hate myself for relapsing into abuse again, and told myself last time in July when I stopped taking the subs, and going through wds for about the 5th time, I was DONE. But PAWS set in.. And you really start to crave them. Maybe I do need a low dose of subs (.5?) a day to keep that feeling away. Although when I'm on subs I don't have as much motivation to go exercise which I love. I go to Crossfit and honestly have only been 3-4x since the wisdom teeth got removed. That really helped with my recovery this past summer/fall. Any input from you guys, or support for the next week or so would be awesome. Maybe I need to go back to my psych and talk it all out with him too.",

And I remember that from last time being the last thing to go away for me which took about 20days. I don't anticipate it being that long seeing that I only used a few strips this past time instead of 15. Been exercising a lot also which always feels great.

Then once I jumped low enough down I got some kratom and did the toss and wash method for roughly 2 weeks until it ran out. It really helps to plug your nose when drinking it lol\n\nI was at 1mg of bupe for about a year and then went from that to a speck in just a short month. \n\nI have been on subs for a solid 6 years of my 35 yo life and addicted to opiates for 15 years. Been through it all just to chase a high. Done just about everything to get the shit. Been to jail. Prison. Rehab. Halfway houses. AA. \n\nSegway : Smart recovery\n-if AA/NA didn\u2019t work for you do yourself a favor and research smart recovery - you can attend in person meetings or via zoom and it\u2019s all about finding the inward strength inside of one\u2019s self instead of relying on a supernatural power and admitting to being powerless over something I\u2019m definitely not powerless to - don\u2019t get me wrong I\u2019m all about that supernatural power but in regards to addiction I needed immense help learning how to go about regulating my feelings, behaviors, and emotions.\n\nI realized that I was never going to stop using subs and kidding myself that I wasn\u2019t a full blown junkie. I was also taking Xanax and told myself uppers were terrible but that didn\u2019t stop me from using them every once in awhile. I\u2019ve learned that I probably have a pretty severe case of ADHD most likely which causes me to want more dopamine and I feel as if bupe has hijacked my ability to live a happy and healthy life.\n\nThe headaches. The constant depression. I have no energy. No motivation. Nothing. And I feel the same way I did taking subs! Crazy. \n\nLuckily I have a great wife who supports me and has always wanted me off this garbage. I\u2019ve been clean now for almost 2 months but it feels more like 2 years. \n\nI understand now that sometimes the highs in my life make me want to use more so than the lows. I talk myself back into addiction by making whatever it is an option by saying things like \u201cyou\u2019ll feel better\u201d or \u201cyou\u2019ll actually want to spend time with your wife and kids if you take something\u201d \u201cyou\u2019ll feel normal\u201d but I know better.\n\nUnderstand that your body and mind play tricks on you. Ask lots of questions. google is your friend. Don\u2019t always trust doctors. They are humans just like you and I. Do your own research. Research the facts and try not to catastrophize everything too much. Give yourself time and space to grieve the loss of a friend - addiction. although it was a really shitty friend, it was still always there for me in times of need. I also had to grieve the me I thought I would be at 35 and realize that God wants me where I\u2019m at right now in this moment. Even if I feel like ass. \n\nIm right where I need to be. So although I\u2019m in pain and mildly irritated constantly and live in anxiety hell - I know that this too shall pass.. eventually. Hopefully. Lol. \n\nI haven\u2019t gotten to one day at a time just yet - I\u2019m moment by moment. But for this moment right now, I choose not to use. That\u2019s all I can hope for.",

It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been on here (maybe a year) but was curious if anyone had any experience with fasting while on Bupe? \n\nI\u2019ve been on Suboxone for 3 years roughly now and it has extremely changed my life for the better. Great job, no trouble, living life to the fullest. \n\nOne issue I did have was weight gain and noticed my health overall has decreased throughout the years. Since intermittent fasting seems to be the new go to for weight loss and overall healthy lifestyle, I wanted to give it a shot. I\u2019ve actually been doing a 16/8 fast for 2 months now and haven\u2019t noticed any negative effects, but I wanted to increase that fast to doing 48 hours once a month and possibly even 72 hours eventually. \n\nNow before anyone rains down on me for the negative side effects of fasting itself, I\u2019ve done a ton of research on it and really filled myself with as much as I could as was once upon a time a certified nutritionist. I\u2019m on here only to find out if anyone knows if there is possible side effects of doing this while on Suboxone since I can\u2019t find anything regarding this anywhere on the web. \n\nThanks in advance for any input!",

        "post_content": "So I wanted to spark this conversation back up with my experience over the course of 2 years while fasting on Buprenorphine. I\u2019ve off subs for almost 2 months now but I fasted during my taper and well prior to even starting to taper. \n\nNow of course anytime that you even consider fasting, especially on any type of medication, it is important that you consult with a medical professional. You may have underlying conditions that a fast could be harmful. \n\nWhen I first kicked off my fast 9 months ago I started with a 7 day detox fast. Water, lemon, cayenne pepper and a little maple syrup was all I consumed for 7days. After that I went onto a 18:6 intermittent fast daily. I still to this day am doing an 18:6 with on the first of every month I fast for 72 hours consuming only water. Absolutely no negative side effects from being on suboxone at the time when I started. Actually I honestly feel that this helped my symptoms when tapering be minimal. This is just anecdotal since there\u2019s no real evidence to support a fast can help with tapering, just my experience. \n\nToday, I am down 40 lbs from when I started, I have actually built muscle and my heart rate and blood pressure have decreased since I started out. Mental clarity has increased and my relationship to food has become healthy. Today I look at food as fuel for the tank and nothing else. My whole life I was a glutton. \n\nThe agriculture industry has been lobbying to keep secret the health Benefits from fasting. But the secret is out and more and more health professionals are coming out and blowing the whistle on what happens to the body during a fast. Regeneration of cells, combatting chronic diseases, weight loss, and even psychiatric healing. \n\nSo the conclusion of this thread and a 3 year experiment on and off of fasting while on suboxone is, I cannot say I had ANY negative side effects from fasting. In fact as I had already stated, I believe it helped me get off suboxone. \n\nThis post is not to be taken as medical advice and it is always of paramount importance to consult with your doctor prior to entering into any fasting regiment. Doing so without medical supervision can be lethal.",

I do take less insulin and eat less but your fast is a little more aggressive. Congrats on the weight loss and totally agree that food is fuel and not much else.

As a result, you find yourself drinking more to achieve a similar feeling. However, you\u2019re probably just getting more intoxicated but not necessarily getting the euphoria you desire. \n\nAs @chipper2 stated above, it\u2019s dangerous game to be mixing heavy alcohol use with opioids, including partial opioids like subutex. You could OD trying to obtain a feeling that is impossible to obtain.\n\nI was on and off subutex and suboxone for about a year or so and I found that it blocked all sense of pleasure. Alcohol was just one element. Even the pleasure of eating a delicious meal, or socializing with friends was affected. It made me depressed.\n\nAs far as alcohol went though, I felt like drinking was hardly worth it on buprenorphine, certainly not enough to feel drunk. If I drank enough alcohol to feel a little giddy, I\u2019d stop because to continue would result in the worst hangover ever! I\u2019m scarred to this day and I haven\u2019t touched buprenorphine in over two years. I switched to methadone. Methadone doesn\u2019t seem to block euphoria but it definitely does decrease alcohol tolerance, which still results in feeling drunk quicker and vicious hangovers.\n\nSo you didn\u2019t mention hangovers from all the drinking you do. What do you experience in the way of hangovers or after effects from drinking? Anything?\n\nIf you can cut back on the alcohol, you\u2019d probably feel better overall. At least try to cut out shots and try to pace yourself some.",

Now this plan that I attached to this thread is intended for people who are prescribed films and have a current dependency with buprenorphine. If you are using suboxone to detox yourself from short acting full agonist opioids, this plan wouldn't be ideal for you. \n\nI have been using this method and I have experienced practically no withdrawals. I am currently down to .75mgs from 16mgs for over 5 years. The plan starts at 3mgs and is a 135 day taper from 3mgs down to 0. The reason I started it at 3 and not any higher is bigger jumps can be made in the beginning of the taper and the true and difficult work really started at 3mgs for me. that is when I needed to slow it down. \n\nI have attached both a PDF file and Excel file so it can be edited and adjusted to fit your plan better. I have been trying to get off subs for the past 3 years and continuously fall on my face due to not having any real structure with a plan. Having a check Off list has really helped organize my plan and I am amazed that I am under 1mg now. Something that I thought I would never be able to get to. With the combination of this plan and utilizing the Journals here on DF, and the positive feedback from other members, I really feel I have spearheaded my largest constraints getting off this medication. \n\nI want to stress that the key with this taper is listening to your body. If you feel you are going too fast, you probably are and its ok to adjust your plan. The goal here is to be free of opioids for the long haul, and seeing how we were on it for years, a few pauses in the taper is OK. I really hope these workplans attached can help some of you that are struggling to get off. Unfortunately, there is really only peoples testimonies to go off of when it comes to getting off Subs, at least I haven't really found any good studies for the best taper plan. Most Doctors are so uneducated on buprenorphine, they will give you a 30 day taper plan and have you jump off at 2mgs. You're barely at that halfway mark at 2mgs and will 100% go into withdrawals for weeks even months for some. \n\nFeel free to reach out to me with any questions. Again this is for people on Long term Maintenance only.",

I stretched it to a 90 day taper to get from 16 down to 3 but this can definitely go quicker if you want. I think I did it in 7 weeks with no issues. But the plan I designed is a 225 day plan to get from 16mgs a day down to 0. Its a total of 100 1/2 8 mg films, which if you go monthly to get your script is only 2 visits to have everything you need to finish. \n\nI have the excel file for the 90 day 16 to 3 taper in this post and the 135 day 3 to 0 taper in the above so you can write in your own dates if you want to start at a later time and want to have the exact dates to track. This is a 7 1/2 month plan that is geared to make you succeed! Slow and steady wins the race! A lot of thought and time has gone into this plan so if you are serious, I truly feel this is the best way to get off. \n\nThis also is not intended to be medical advice. I am not a doctor, just a long time opiate addict whos done years of research on suboxone and other opiates. \n\nGood Luck on your Journey!",

I did my first injection for a week all seemed fine got my second injection for a week still all good, I went back a week later to get my 3rd injection this time a monthly dose it was about now I noticed a small irritation at first injection site. It was very mild and I wasn\u2019t even shore it was connected I thought perhaps I was bitten or stung by something but but as days passed it got worse more red and inflamed very sore and itchy, and then 2nd injection site started to become irritated. 7 more days have passed now 3rd injection site seems fine no irritation. 2nd injection site sore to touch very red, 1st injection site super painful and red and starting to blister. Friction from wearing a shirt is unbearable. Has anyone had any reactions like this? How did you treat symptoms? Did this problem persist with further injections? Any other tips?",

        "post_content": "The best way to go about it is, to use an oral syringe or an insulin syringe(break off the needle) to absorb the solution of suboxone and squirt it up your nose. Oral syringes are free at a lot of pharmacies, just ask for a couple. I'd squirt 1/5th of a ml of liquid per squirt so it absorbs nicely, and little runs to your throat. Also I'd rather just plug it tbh. Snorting bullshit just causes so many problems after a point sinus wise... Although I dont know if snorting films is less damaging than pills binders. \n\nAlso with bupe, it's a partial agonist and doesn't activate the receptors fully like most opiates. But one of it's metabolites is a full agonist, and at low doses it doesn't get completely out competed by bupe. \nSo low doses tend to be more euphoric for most people. Taking multiple doses a day may reduce that, but it still might be pretty apparent to you U.D.",

It should be in the opiates forum because you\u2019re talking about getting high on suboxone instead of using it only for addiction treatment.\n\nAs for whether 4 mg is a low dose, I would say it\u2019s a moderate dose for addiction treatment but a very high dose for pain management. Pain management doses are extremely low, in microdoses - less than a milligram. I think they\u2019re in micrograms usually.\n\n@doingdadope did a half milligram and I\u2019d consider that a pretty low dose, at least for addiction treatment.",

It\u2019s like nasal spray? A 10 of dope \u2026 what\u2019s that? Like a 10th of a gram - 10 mgs? Sorry. I\u2019m tired and can\u2019t think straight but regardless the dose is irrelevant without knowing the strength of the substance.\n\nSo I\u2019d at least wait 12 hours from the rinse. Each time getting on suboxone from heroin for me was more difficult. It took longer for me to get the dope out of my system to avoid precipitated withdrawal. I had to wait 24 hours at least and still I didn\u2019t get a lot of relief when I finally took the buprenorphine.\n\nIf you can wait 24 hours, do that.\n\nYou\u2019re aware of the Clinical opioid withdrawal scale? Use that and focus on the most objective measurements, like your heart rate.\n\nGood luck! Be patient! Be careful!",

Hope the small bit you took is helping you rather than hurting.\n\nFor future reference, you take your heart rate by using a timer for aminute and counting your pulse. Your heart rate is beats per minute. You can find your pulse by placing your middle and pointer finger either the inside of your wrist or the side of your neck, near the top where it meets the bottom of your jaw, almost under your ear, but not quite that far from your chin. To me, I can feel my pulse best on the side of my neck.\n\nOnce you find your pulse, try counting the beats. When you\u2019re comfortable counting, set a stop watch or timer to one minute and immediately start counting. The beats you count in that minute is your heart rate in bpm or beats per minute. I\u2019d wait until my heart rate was 90 - 100 bpm. My resting heart rate is 70-75 bpm. If yours is higher or lower, take that into consideration as far as judging whether your heart rate is elevated.",

If you aren\u2019t getting more sick and feel like you need more, you don\u2019t have to wait that much longer. An hour or two is good.\n\nI\u2019m so glad you didn\u2019t get precipitated withdrawal. It\u2019s the worst! It would be so awful to face that degree of sickness alone. My husband helped me when it happened to me. But he didn\u2019t know about the extent of my addiction and thought it was food poisoning. I felt so terrible and so guilty. It was a nightmare.\n\nSeems like you\u2019re going to be fine. Remember less I more with buprenorphine. If you\u2019re good on 4 mg, stay there. You\u2019ll have an easier taper when the time comes.\n\nI\u2019m going to go back to bed but will check here again in the morning.

And my pupils are small again.\nI go back to the clinic on Thursday to get back on my full dose which is the highest dose it normally takes for the first week. Then by week two I wanna go down to 16 mg stay on that for a few months then work on tapering.\nI joined this site in hopes of finding support to help me stay clean. \nAnd I'm trying to pin point my relapse triggers.\nThis relapse was caused by feelings of rejection from my family when I came out as gay then I had a argument with my boyfriend. About two weeks ago I relapsed due to feelings of rejection and loneliness. My boyfriend stayed on video chat with me from 11:33 last night to 10 am today he's great. I feel bad he doesn't use never has and he doesn't really understand but he's been nothing but supportive.\nAnother trigger is my roommate best friend still using and he's been sick and too scared to star Suboxone but I'm hoping I can convince him to go to the clinic on Friday too. Because they give the first dose there and have protocols in place in case someone goes into precipitation withdrawals. \nI stayed clean for months while my roommate was using but when stress happens i just want to escape and my roommate has always been my best friend and we always got high together.\nSo idk I definitely need to find healthy coping mechanism and get my roommate convinced to start treatment with me \nAnd thank you so much for checking in on me you've been a great help.",

Seriously, normal withdrawal is bad enough; it\u2019s truly terrifying to know it can be so much worse. \n\nWhen I\u2019m logged in and see anyone worrying about precipitated withdrawal or when to take their buprenorphine, I always try to respond as quickly as I can. I know timing is important, especially if someone is frightened and/or sick.\n\nI was a fairly new member here when I had my run-in with precipitated withdrawal and my clinic wasn\u2019t available to help me. It was July 4 - a holiday. I left a message on their answering service and no one returned my call until the next day! \n\nI could hardly type on my phone, I was trembling so badly and so sick. But @TheBigBadWolf answered my questions once I finally got them out. He and a couple other members responded and helped me through that awful experience. I\u2019ll be eternally grateful to him and this forum for that. It\u2019s the least I can do now to try to help others avoid experiencing that horror, if I can. Or be there for them if it happens. \n\nIf you\u2019ve never had precipitated withdrawal, fingers crossed for you that you never will.\n\nRegarding your living situation, I can see how hard it would be to stay strong when your vice is available under the same roof. I had a hard time getting rid of my heroin and relapsed a million times just because it was available when I was upset about something and looking for an escape. \n\nIt\u2019ll be awesome if you best friend goes to the clinic with you! I really hope he does, for your sake. Did you tell him how hard it is for you that he\u2019s still using?",

In my experience when I managed to pull through physical withdrawal (from poppy pod tea prior to my brilliant decision to switch to heroin) I was at my most vulnerable. I didn\u2019t have a good strategy to manage my emotional response and it took just days for me to relapse.\n\nI\u2019m mentioning this because your friend may not be all that serious about quitting or getting on suboxone. Does he sound like he really wants to give it up? Is he ready? You mentioned that he\u2019d be right back to using now if he wasn\u2019t broke.\n\nSuboxone is great for people who are ready to quit getting high but not prepared to face full withdrawal and unsure about their ability to resist cravings. But it\u2019s not a miracle drug. It never worked to change my mind about wanting heroin. I wanted it to change my mind for me, to make me want to give up heroin and feel ok about it, but that didn\u2019t happen. I tried more times than I can count to stay on suboxone and rarely lasted more than a week or two before giving in to my intense cravings. I\u2019m afraid your friend will have a similar experience if he\u2019s not ready to quit.\n\nI recommend really talking to him about why you\u2019re quitting and what motivated you. Feel him out about his reasons, his motivations. You can talk about helping each other with cravings and other obstacles to abstinence. Let him know you are both in the fight together.\n\nI imagine if he doesn\u2019t want to have that discussion with you that he might not be ready to quit and you\u2019ll have to figure out a way to cope with staying on your suboxone while he continues to use heroin or fentanyl or whatever. If he\u2019s not ready, perhaps give him some time to come around. But if he doesn\u2019t and you\u2019re struggling, then you might have to consider a different living arrangement.",

As far as the high, I think that is totally up to the individual. \n\nI've heard many peeps say that it doesn't help with pain unless it's a very high dose, over 12mgs or a very low dose, like . 25. When very low doses are used, less is more. \nThis is what I was told by a doctor friend on sub concerning that. \n\"At very low doses the effect relative to the opioid standard of morphine is 50 times greater. The higher the dose the more that decays. So 1mg is many times more effective than it's dose equivalent of morphine, but at higher doses that gap closes.\" So ... That is why Less is More.",

Start buying on the street or finish it all forever. My 2 kids are the only reason I'm still alive. My Dr. knows my story and suggested Suboxone. After a 3-4 days I found the right dose (8mg) and so far I am more than satisfied (except for constipation). I am not in pain, almost forgot about painkillers and my mental state improved. I have 2 choices now. Continue with this treatment or switch to Sublocade injection. Your opinion?\n\n\n--- Double Post Merged, Jun 13, 2022 ---\n\n\nI think that all depends of the circumstances.

I was depressed several years before deciding to help myself with the opiates. I was seeing a psychologist on a regular basis, but all he does was changing the antidepressants. Not a single word of support. \n\nI am still on them and have no idea do they actually work anymore? Suboxone is better than all of them together. But until several months ago, nobody told me about that. They know and they are aware that opioids can have major role in treating depression. If they wanted, they could have make a perfect antidepressant and save millions of lives. But, who would buy Zooloft, Prosac, lexapro and other stuff anymore? So, it's all about the money. \n\nPainkillers are addictive, they say. Try to quit any of the antipsychotics(like I did, several times). It's a hell and side effects wouldn't wish to my worst enemy. To cut the long story short, let's get to the conclusion. You could treat depression with two kinds of medication. Both are very addictive. But one of them really works and the other doesn't. Still, 6 out of 10 people are on some kind of antidepressants. \n\nYou are right when you say that beside the medication you must believe in something. I couldn't agree more. But in order to do that, you must be mentally strong. Unfortunately, many people don't have that ability...",

I am not alone here and feel free to read some horror stories about long term meaning over 10 years in my opinion. I used to be social and have feelings, that went bye bye and I\u2019m giving you the short version. \n\nI tapered for about 9 months before jumping off of them because I wanted to feel again. I mean I was as void as somebody in a coma, plus it killed my sex live and physically made my legs swell. All sorts of shit, teeth got gum disease on bottom and I had nice choppers and I don\u2019t smoke. I brush and floss didn\u2019t matter and I know it\u2019s from taking that shit 3 times a day in the beginning. \n\nI could go on but just be careful and remember the younger you are the easier it will be to aped off but remember you still twist dem wires in your brain up and it\u2019s been a 1 1/2 for me off subs and I\u2019m still a head case. \n\nthey do feel like the best anti-depressant but just read up on them. It sucks there is no data on them for really long term use. I still crave them when my stomach is absolutely empty and growls, cause I know how good it would make me feel until those headaches and non stop sweating start. I also couldn\u2019t sleep for so long, still only get 4 or 5 hours. I was on films and got my dose down below 1mg and realized that I felt better on that than when I was on 12mgs, lower is better they say. It was for me for sure but just throwing some quick personal experience your way. Use them until you feel like there not helping but taking over your being, then read up on how to taper the real way. Doctors are so uninformed and always have people on too high a dose imo. I agree on the other meds, there shit and fuck big pharma. They just want you hooked on something. \n\nEver do psychedelics? Look into it, amazing things happening for people with ptsd and depression/anxiety etc. I\u2019m talking about doing them with a safe place and somebody not trippin their ass off btw. Not sure Australia has clinics like that but I\u2019m sure there\u2019s something. \n\nPeace man",

I heard that some people abuse Subs and injecting it or dividing it in several doses, but never tried that and never will. \n\nThat little \"buzz\" at the beginning lasts maybe a month or two, and that is it. I am not an expert or pretending to be one, but in my opinion Subs works if you feel NOTHING. When I take my little strip in the morning I absolutely don't feel anything. But, I have no desire to go back to opioids, my tension headache is almost gone and my chronic depression is much better. \n\nThe best word to describe all this is NORMAL. If you feel almost normal without major side effects, Suboxone works. If you are looking for fun and want to feel \"good\", this one is definitely not for you.

I would always appreciate words from someone with the experience than some clinical trials data and other empty words from people who never tried Subs. I am still a newbie and started taking Subs several months ago. \n\nThe \"honeymoon\" period lasted about 2 months and now I literally feel nothing after taking my dose. I am not disappointed at all because I was expecting this. Like every other drug, Subs with time loose it's \"happy\" feeling due to tolerance. If you were 16 years on Suboxone that's a miracle for me. I was very close to end all the suffering and if I manage to follow your example, that would mean that I lived 16 years more than I expected. \n\nIt's still early to me to start tapper it down as I have very serious health concerns about my daughter. Hopefully when everything is OK, I'll try to slowly reduce the dose from 8 to 4mg. But at the moment I am not thinking about that. I must again repeat my favourite saying:\"Don't fix something that is not broken\". I am grateful for every minute of my \"new life\". \n\nNothing is perfect and that includes Subs as well. But waking up without thinking how to end your life, it's a big improvement and I am grateful for that. What the future brings, nobody knows for sure. All the best mate. \u270c\ufe0f",

So it's impossible to get exactly the same dose. The main problem is that when you get the injection, you are stuck for a month and there is no way back. How they figure out which dose is right for you and what the possible side effects are, can only answer somebody who tried both methods.\n\n\n--- Double Post Merged, Jul 28, 2022 ---\n\n\n\n\nBirdJungle said:\n\u2191\n\nWhat about plain subutex? Is there a shortage of that too?\n\nI assume if you\u2019re happy with suboxone, you\u2019ll be just as good with sublocade. Are the available doses similar to what you\u2019re taking now? Are you taking your suboxone once a day or twice?Click to expand...\n\nI forgot one important thing. You can't get Sublocade injection once a month just like that and go home. Counselling is compulsory if you want to continue your treatment. I really have no desire or patience to listen to that bull. It's 15 years to late for that.",

I usually take only 16mg a day\nDay 1 subs, pretty horrible, but new drug so expected \nDay 2-4 pretty good, stable, but I would get absolutely no noticeable effects from subs at all. But no withdrawal\nDay 5-6 body exhausted and sore and tired\nDay 7-9 severe cravings and really bad mental health plunge.\nDay 10-14 borderline suicidal, passive aggressive, full self hatred and hatred for everything about me. Sleep really suffering, constant emotional episodes.\n\nReally uncomfortable stuff. \n\nQuestions. \n\nHas anyone had a similar experience from going in or switching to subs from methadone. Or going on it in general? \n\nI am meant to get the injection tomorrow, \nBut I'm very concerned about my suffering mental health that maybe bupe is not right for me. \n\nIf I am to go back to methadone, I'll have to make that decision within the next 24 hours or I'll be stuck for a full month.\n\nIf it is the right decision, I will go back on methadone, but I wanted to get some perspectives and thoughts from people who have had more experience than I. \n\nAny thoughts and input would be appreciated \n\nMany thanks \n\nVmjs",

I\u2019m not on any drugs for mental health. \n\nMy doctor diagnosed me with generalized anxiety and he gave me hydroxyzine to deal with anxiety on suboxone/quitting heroin. After several relapses, he wanted to put me on an ssri with the suboxone because they\u2019re supposed to work well together for addiction related anxiety and depression.\n\nBut no matter what we tried, I always reached a point where I couldn\u2019t handle the suboxone anymore and I\u2019d relapse. We tried a lot of different things, raising the dose to 24 mg daily from 16, split doses,, using the micodose/Burnese methadone for induction.\n\nIt\u2019s strange, but I could never shake the idea of myself as an opiate addict in limbo on suboxone. I always wanted heroin, or something! \n\nI\u2019ve mentioned this here before a few times and when I have more time, I\u2019ll find the link and copy here. Suboxone combined with quitting heroin made me extremely depressed and worse after almost every attempt. \n\nMy doctor eventually suggested I try methadone and it\u2019s been a much better experience. It took me a while to totally stop using H but I haven\u2019t done any other opiates except my methadone dose in almost seven months now.\n\nIf suboxone makes you super depressed, I don\u2019t recommend going on the shot.",

        "post_content": "@vmjs9424 What did you decide to do? Did you get the shot or another couple weeks of suboxone tablets?\n\nI couldn\u2019t find the post where I succinctly described my experience switching over to suboxone the last time I tried it. It was rough emotionally to transition from heroin. As soon as the withdrawal was over I felt an overwhelming sense of nothingness and anhedonia. It was crushing and all I could think about was what I could take to get out of that emotional state. I couldn\u2019t hide my deep depression either. My husband figured out what was happening; that I had relapsed again and was trying to get back on suboxone. He knew the signs but the last time was by far the worst; it was scary.\n\nI would imagine making the switch with methadone would be much more difficult, if you\u2019re response is anything like mine. I would not be surprised at all to learn others, including yourself, experienced severe depressive symptoms when making the transition to buprenorphine from any full agonist opiate/opioid, particularly strong ones like methadone. \n\nLike @cheeps said, it\u2019s not you necessarily, it\u2019s the way the drugs affect your brain chemistry.\n\nAnyway, I hope you\u2019re good with whichever decision you made. If you got the shot and you\u2019re still struggling with depression, just know it\u2019ll only be a few weeks, not forever. You can always go back to the tablet or back to methadone. Or you could try tapering off altogether if that\u2019s a goal for you.",

I still had the same negative emotional issues and I also had cravings. It didn\u2019t matter for me if my buprenorphine dose was high, I wanted something from heroin that buprenorphine was not providing and I couldn\u2019t handle it.\n\nIt sounds like you might be a little like me, where there\u2019s something about the full agonist action from methadone that actually helps you stay balanced. Personally, for me, I plan to taper down off methadone, maybe starting next week or the following. I might not be ready to come off it but my dose is 160 mg and I\u2019ll really like to reduce it.\n\nWhat dose were you on with methadone?\n\nLike you said you heard from others, I have also heard less is more with buprenorphine. I think you can drop your dose to 16 without feeling any withdrawal symptoms. Have you tried that. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to take a different dose every day. That\u2019s just confusing your body. Go down to 16, once a day or split 8-8. Then do 12. Then 8 and see if you start feeling better emotionally.\n\nIf the NA meetings were helping you stay focused and feel better about yourself, probably a good idea to return. Or find something similar.\n\nTry to think a little more positively. Remember to care for yourself. It was worth it for yourself to quit your original drug of choice. You\u2019ve succeeded there and that\u2019s a big hurdle on its own. Try to love yourself and know that despite whatever happened in the past, you\u2019re worthy of love, respect, care. You may feel isolated because isolated yourself. You can change that later, or whenever you feel good enough to get back out there and socialize.",

This is why I'm maxing 16mg and having days of less, which I personally don't feel nay difference from it but who knows. \nI'll do 16mg consistent for a week and see where I'm at. \n\nI was on opiates for about 3-4 years \nI had a few moments early with Heroin but wasn't easy to get so I didn't make ajy habit out of that. \nstarting frequent use codeine, then dihydrocodeine, was on that for 2 years, Covid lockdowns happened and then due to price and access, went on research chemicals, or Heroin if the research were not available. Was crashing very hard very quickly, especially after a literal car crash that I'm incredibly lucky to have walked away from. \nSought help after I told my family, got out on methadone, stayed on for 7 months, then planned the injection, but had to do strips suboxone for 2 weeks first. And it's been horrible since then\n\nI do not want to be on maintenance. I'd prefer to be off it all and to get my life back. \nI lost everything.. And it'll be a very hard road to get something small back.. \nTaking anything will just make that goal impossible.. \n\n\nTo birdjungle. \n\nI was on methadone for 7 months\nStarting at 30mg by legal requirement \nRaised to 65, then as I had planned to go to rehab and they at the time told me you need to be at 30mg before we will consider it\nI then dropped over a few months down to 30, and that rehab was then like sorry don't have the resources to take you \nSo I went to a different rehab, left after 7 days because it was really horribly managed and the people there, some were nice, but others very aggressive and rude only there because court told them they had to be, \n\nSo I left, moved to my dad's, got involved with NA, got a sponsor, got involved with a rehabs day program, and had weekly conversations with a psychologist.\n\nAfter leaving, I ended up on 45mg again,\nThen over some more time reduced down to 25mg\nHeld\nMade the switch to bupe at 20mg, review in 1 day. I think I messed up placement under my tounge several times so likely lost some\nGot put on 24\nHad bad reaction, told doc, he said let's go to the injection then, and I was like I don't feel comfortable being locked in if it really isn't going to work.. \nPut on 32mg instead, \nStarted getting visual closed eye hallucinations at that level, \n\nAll research done led me to decide I wanted to reduce. \nSo max 16, wanting to reduce to 8 or below\n\nWith methadone, after being in full agonist drugs for ages, methadone was great, it lasted a good amount of time and it had a really nice set of effects. \n\nOn methadone I usually dosed every 2nd day, doubling my dose and having a day without.\nBut I pulled myself together for the 1.5 months prior to switching to bupe.\n\nThat is something I lost and really struggled with\nNot getting that opiate relief to everything that was going on.\n\nI could be relaxed, well rested, balanced and well managed. \nSo yes I have always appreciated and enjoyed the opiate euphoria and sedative effects that are completely nonexistant with the bupe.\n\nI currently 16mg Max daily \nBut take some days reduced so I can work on my tolerance, while due to long half life have a day of normal dose so that it doesn't go too low.\n\nI'm still attending my meetings, I've actually recently started some service in my group.\n\n\nI am often a very logical and well thought out person \nI do still have days where I know I am okay, I know I have made great success so far.\nBut where that before was something I was proud of and doing well with.\nNow it's just down all the time\n\nI may still get to think critically but it's very much laced with exhaustion and frustration \n\nI just want to not feel like this so non stop.. \n\nVmjs",

These DRs are simply doing what the drug manufacturers are telling them.\n\nIf you do stay on the oral bupe, you need to reduce down to 2mgs a day. I will be glad to help you with a taper.\n\nThe detox difference between Done & Bupe is that Bupe causes more mental anguish because of its rapport with the kappa receptors. Those receptors have to do with your mood. That's why you are having issues. Done works on the Mu receptors so it is more a physical issue. Bupe is more of a mind fuck but it also is physically hard.\n\nI have detoxed off of both but the amount of time I was on Bupe was only 2 weeks. I went from 10 mgs to zero in 14 days. The done was ten years on 70mgs. I them reduced to 40mgs over 2 months, then used SAO taper cocktail for 21 days and stopped. Because of the 10 year history with done, it was very hard on my body.

That means anything above that is just extra dope. It's very possible that you are doing too much. The only way to know is to reduce to 8mgs. Normally it take 10-14 days to stabilize on a dose. Most people I've dealt with were able to get to 8mgs with very little trouble. But everyone is different. What may be right for someone else may be wrong for you. Some peeps insist they need more than 8mgs to cover cravings. Do you have or have had any mental cravings?\n\n\n--- Double Post Merged, Jul 4, 2022 ---\n\nIf I was in your shoes and on Bupe, I'd go to 8mgs for a month. After you get stable, you can then go much lower. If you go back to methadone, you should go as low as you can. 20mgs even. Both these drugs need very slow tapering when you have to get off of them. \n\nI asked about cravings because if you don't need MAT, you should keep your eye on getting stable, then getting off these drugs.",

        "post_content": "Hello again. I have a couple more thoughts based on all that you described above. \n\nFirst, I am pretty sure that if you can reduce your buprenorphine to a much lower dose, as low as you can without distracting discomfort, you\u2019ll get much better sleep. Buprenorphine is known to keep people up at night. I had a similar problem with it and my doctor gave me trazodone for sleep and hydroxyzine for anxiety. I\u2019d take both before bed. They\u2019re not habit forming; my doctor was a stickler about prescribing me anything even remotely addictive. Sleep is extremely important to your overall well-being.\n\nSecond, the way you were dosing your methadone was just keeping you satisfied with your opiate addiction by allowing yourself to feel the opiate euphoria every other day. Skipping doses and doing double doses is reinforcing addictive behavior. Did you go to a clinic? I\u2019m surprised you were even allowed to do that unless you got weekly take homes. At my clinic the most you could get for take homes the first year was 3, when Covid exceptions weren\u2019t in place allowing three additional. And you couldn\u2019t have them all in a row. \n\nI think you\u2019re mostly depressed because you sorely miss your opiate bliss. You might not feel it consciously but I think your brain craves the opiate effects that lead to feelings of satisfaction and well-being. It\u2019s not always about the high - the psychological attraction and addiction. \n\nBoth maintenance meds are meant to level out the opioid effects so that they don\u2019t fluctuate and your brain can stabilize. If you\u2019re not taking a steady dose, your brain still experiences the valleys and peaks that you get doing short acting opiates. I understand not wanting to give that up. I continued using heroin for several months when I was on methadone, which probably had a similar effect. It wasn\u2019t until I quit H that I really started to feel mentally stable and able to deal with everyday anxieties.\n\nThe objective with maintenance drugs is to maintain a steady state. And that\u2019s not easy at first. It takes some getting used to, to give up the euphoric peaks, even if you don\u2019t consciously realize you have or crave these peaks. I suspect on methadone you did notice it and that\u2019s why you saved your doses to feel double effects every other day. Consciously or subconsciously, that\u2019s probably why you were changing your doses on buprenorphine. Unfortunately buprenorphine doesn\u2019t offer much in the way of euphoria if you have a tolerance to full agonist opiates.\n\nWith all that in mind, I think you should really give a steady dose a try. Do it for a month or two. I really don\u2019t think you need the shot. In fact, due to the way you\u2019ve been dosing, it might drive you nuts and trigger cravings. Have you mentioned your self-prescribed dosing regimens to your doctor or your NA friends?\n\nOnce you\u2019re stable on buprenorphine, you just might feel ready to reduce your dose further and taper off. You\u2019ll probably start feeling ready to simply come off it, instead of prolonging things with the shot. I guess the shot makes sense if you have a hard time sticking to your dose, but then how will you respond to urges to feel euphoria? \n\nYou\u2019ve got a lot to think about but I think you\u2019ll get figure it out. You have the drive, the resources and the motivation. You just need to think more positively about yourself, develop more discipline and accept that you\u2019ll have to give up euphoric highs and artificial feelings of well-being to successfully leave your opiate addiction behind.",

        "post_content": "Whether 40 mg methadone is a strong dose is totally relative. Compared to my relatively high dose of 160 mg, I would not consider 40 mg to be strong. However, methadone is a strong drug by nature, so 40 mg would be quite strong for someone who didn\u2019t have a tolerance to opioids. What was your previous dose?\n\nDoses ranging from 60 to 100 mg are generally regarded as within the optimal range for positive addiction treatment outcomes. This study is cited a lot: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12917925/\n\nI hope you feel OK about going back on methadone. Will you get more carry home doses soon if you have clean drug screens? It sucks methadone isn\u2019t treated more like buprenorphine, where a whole month\u2019s worth can be prescribed by your doctor. It\u2019s so much more convenient.\n\nBut convenience isn\u2019t enough when you need a full agonist to keep you stable, like I did. Methadone actually works for me personally; it helped me change my perspective toward heroin. If it can do the same for you, you\u2019ll be happy you switched back.\n\nI don\u2019t understand your first question about buprenorphine and your tolerance on 8 mg if you wanted buprenorphine? Are you still considering sticking with buprenorphine and wondering if you will feel OK - not in withdrawal - on 8 mg? Not sure. Sounds like you tried that and still couldn\u2019t tolerate the side effects, regardless of whether it kept you out of withdrawal? \n\nAfter you switch back to methadone, you\u2019ll need to drop to at least 30 mg and wait a couple days until you\u2019re in moderate withdrawal (see clinical opioid withdrawal scale) to get back on buprenorphine. Not sure if that\u2019s what you were asking? \n\nOr are you trying to ask whether 40 mg methadone is enough to hold you, given that your buprenorphine dose was 8 mg daily? It\u2019s hard to answer that question. Everyone metabolizes methadone and buprenorphine differently.",

        "post_content": "ok, here's my story (in a nutshell).\n\naddicted to heroin for some years, and have been on metadone for almost 3 years. My dose was ah high as 75ml, but I had gradually reduced by 5 ml a month down to 30. What I did next, I wouldn't recommend to anyone, but I suppose it worked for me (maybe, dunno yet). I completely stopped taking my methadone, (but still collected it from the chemist 3 days a week) and went back onto H for 2 weeks, to cover the withdrawls from the methadone. I was surprised that either the H these days is weaker than when I was using, or my tolerance was put way up on the methadone, but I had to use a consoderabl;e amount more to stave of WDs. \n\nAnyway, as i say, I used for 2 weeks, and I dont even know why I did this, but I spoke to my drugs worker, and requested starting suboxone. (I told the worker I had stopped the meth for 3 days in prep, to avoid precipitated withdrawls) she was fine with this, and wrote me a script for the next day. \n\nMy 1st day, I was in WDs from the H, went to chemist, and got 4mg of sub there, and 4 home. I rattled the full day, no precipitated, but the sub dose just wasn't high enough. The next day, my does was up to 16mg sub, and while this eventually made my WDs cease, I had a horrible headache all night. The third day, which was yesterday, I had 16mg again, and no real WDs, but again, an awful headache, and also, my tastebuds seem to be messed up. I cant enjoy a ciggarette, and my favourite fizzy drink at all. (these are minor things, I know).\n\nSo between last night and today, Ive read a lof of things online which have made me think I should have just rode out the H withdrawls, rather than start on another drug here, which seems to have a litany of its own effects.\n\nwhat would your advice be at this point, 3 days in to sub script? stop cold? detox down? (I just want off, I actually for first time in my life feel ready to do a withdrawal.)",

Plus it's easy to taper with subs because you know exactly how much you're taking (unlike heroin where you don't know the purity). But I'm also a bit biased because when I went to detox I was put on suboxone and five days later when I got out I forgot my scripts in my room and didn't realize it until they next day, and the doctors refused to rewrite them because they were convinced I was lying about having left them in my room. So now not only am I addicted to one more drug, but I have to detox myself from my detox drug. \n\nThe other times I have used suboxone to taper what I did was cut the previous days dose in half. So in your case I would go 16 mg day 1, 8 mg day 2, 4 mg day 3, 2 mg day 4, 1 mg day 5, 1/2, mg day 6, 1/4, day 7. If you feel breakthrough symptoms just take a little more and then the next day cut your total dose from the day before in half. I'm not sure if that's the \"right\" way to go about it but that's the way that's worked for me and my friends before.\n\nGood luck and make sure to let us know how it goes.",

My thinking was, I would stay on 16 mg till Monday ( 3 days from now) and then start tapering down 2 mg a day, till off. As I say, that was somewhat of a provisional idea, although, if it really would be best just to stop everything right now, I would be more than open to that too. Like I say, for probably the first time in my life, Im ready to WD, im kida annoyed that the first few days getting onto the subs, i was in Wds anyway, and thinking about it, I wish I just rode it out. The more I hear about subs, the more I wish I hadn't started. \n\nOne of the reasons I feel I that im ready to just Wd, is that I went doing this whole process not when the money ran out, or Ive hit a bottom or whatever, ....if I wanted Im financially able to go on a run of H for a good while, but I don't even want to a little bit. usually when Ive been making decisions to start ,methadone, or NA or any of the other things Ive tried, its because Ive been unable to go on using as I have no money, and my family/friends/ppl around me have had enough of my using. this time, I feel differently about it.",

Maybe you need to so that when you look back you can say \"wow that sucked\" instead of \"that was easy...I wouldn't mind doing that again.\"\n\nMaybe you could try doing it cold turkey (since you seem so keen to the idea) and just remember if it gets too bad just take a little bit of the suboxone and just slowly up the dose until you feel better, or until the wd is bearable. \n\nIf you want to talk feel free to PM me.

It is very hard for opiate addicts to do it that way, but you seem to talk with the conviction of quitting so I would say just go cold turkey and keep a few subs on hand n case of a breakthrough wd then stop again.

My methadone treatment has probably saved my life, not to mention 2 months after starting the therapy I finally got off my butt, went to medical college, and just graduated with a 4.00 GPA! I wish I could get off the methadone, but right now would be a very bad time, just because I would lose all this ambition I have and probably would go from a college grad looking for a job back to a h and pill junkie, and that just cannot happen again!",

        "post_content": "@NomoreAlice What\u2019s going on? Did you decide to stay off the subutex and keep powering through the withdrawals? Did you quit cold turkey? What was your dose?\n\nLots of people are around to help. I\u2019m obsessed lately with responding to people - maybe because it helps me not lose sight of my own challenges with opiates. I\u2019m on 160 mg methadone and going to start my taper within a couple weeks. So that\u2019s at the top of my mind! Enough about me - let us know what\u2019s happening with you and how we can help!\n\nBy the way, your doctor sounds pretty mean if he expressed to you he was unhappy about you wanting to quit and isn\u2019t offering you any help. Will he at least prescribe you some withdrawal medication like the gabapentin you have and/or clonidine? Is he your general practitioner or a specific buprenorphine doctor?\n\nDo you have any subutex left, where you can take just enough to function without tons of discomfort and start slowly reducing down day after day? Some people reduce all the way down to a speck before jumping off to help minimize the severity of the withdrawal.\n\nCold turkey off such strong, long-acting opiates is a hard road. You\u2019ll get through it. You will get better. Your brain will stabilize. Not sure what\u2019s going on with your legs and the neurotransmitters. The opiates might have been masking something like sciatica. It\u2019s probably a good idea to find a caring general practitioner to give you a physical.\n\nTake care! And if you had to go back on the subutex, don\u2019t beat yourself up about it. It\u2019s OK if you weren\u2019t ready to quit yet. If you went back on subutex, the bright side is that next time you decide to detox, you can plan things out better. Taper, get helper meds, prepare some nourishing food ahead of your withdrawal and write up a relapse prevention plan.\n\n\u2026 Addendum \u2026\n\nHey, I just noticed you posted something similar to the above in late April. Are the ongoing symptoms you\u2019re having a continuation from that long ago?! Did your doctor have you drop cold turkey at 4 mg?! Ouch. It doesn\u2019t sound like much but it is a lot! \n\nBuprenorphine is prescribed in microdoses for pain and doctors taper off their patients from microdoses of buprenorphine if they need to come off for whatever reason. So 4 mg is a hell of a dose to drop from. One guy on this forum quit from 16! He survived but it sounded pretty brutal. It took about a year for him to get back to normal.\n\nIt\u2019s normal to still have some symptoms after dropping from a high dose like that but they should be subsiding, getting better with time.\n\nIf you\u2019re experiencing anhedonia, where you don\u2019t want to do anything, the best thing to do is to do something, anything that will bring you some pleasure (away from your sofa).\n\nGo for a walk? Go out to lunch and people watch? Go play with kittens at the animal rescue. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re into but you have to break through that barrier of stifling nothingness to start getting pleasure from life again. It\u2019s hard to get motivated I know, but it\u2019s worth it.",

        "post_content": "Buprenorphine is a complicated and often misunderstood drug.\nIt has a stronger effect at lower doses and as dose increases a ceiling effect on respiration. A lower effect at higher dose?\nBuprenorphine is said to be both stronger than morphine and only a partial agonist that does not stimulate the receptor as much as morphine. Which is it?\n\nThese things seem contradictory. After many years of rigorous, dedicated, tireless trial and personal error, I present my findings and theories on the enigma of buprenorphine...\n\nBuprenorphine is a partial agonist at Mu receptors and is metabolised into norbuprenorphine by CYP450 enzyme in the liver. Norbuprenorphine is a full agonist at Mu receptors so has stronger subjective feeling than buprenorphine. But norbupe is also conjugated in the liver by a second enzyme. Conjugated means it has a simple sugar attached to it which makes the molecule polar. Polar molecules don't cross the blood brain barrier so even though norbuprenorphine is technically stronger than buprenorphine it can't get into the brain and so has very little effect.\n\nThe thing is, CYP450 enzymes are not only present in the liver. They are also present in the cytoplasm of many other cells in the body including the mucus membrane in the mouth. Conjugated norbuprenorphine is basically lost but unconjugated norbuprenorphine is a very strong full agonist that may be responsible for the much of the good feeling after taking buprenorphine.\n\nSo taking your subutex under the tongue, some of it gets metabolised into a full Mu agonist norbuprenorphine and is not conjugated. The conjugating enzyme are only present in the liver. So this unconjugated norbuprenorphine can cross the blood brain barrier and this feels good. I have read many people say that sublingual buprenorphine FEELS better subjectively than shooting buprenorphine . Well maybe this is why... Some of it is converted to nonpolar unconjugated full agonist norbuprenorphine when you take it sublingually..\n\nMany people will tell you there is no rush when shooting buprenorphine but over time it starts to feel good... Maybe this is because buprenorphine has to be converted to norbuprenorphine before it feels good. \n\nThis also explains why buprenorphine feels better at lower doses because buprenorphine is a competitive partial antagonist for it's own full agonist metabolite norbuprenorphine . Also why lower doses are stronger and high doses have a ceiling effect on respiratory depression. Higher doses of buprenorphine are blockading the unbound full agonist norbuprenorphine metabolite.\n\n\nhere are some pharmacology papers for reference. You can google these titles to read the abstracts.\n\nComparison of Pharmacological Activities of Buprenorphine and Norbuprenorphine: Norbuprenorphine Is a Potent Opioid Agonist\n\nKinetics of Respiratory Depression in Rats Induced by Buprenorphine and its Metabolite, Norbuprenorphine\n\n\nWhen trying to find good information about Norbuprenorphine one comes across conflicting papers. Many papers fail to differentiate between conjugated buprenorphine which can't cross the blood brain barrier and unconjugated buprenorphine which can cross the blood brain barrier. \n.\nIn my experience taking CYP450 inducers increases the subjective full agonist feeling of bupe. Maybe because more unconjugated nor buprenorphine is metabolised.\n\nIf this is all true, it is the best reason NOT to shoot your buprenorphine . Something many of us have found out ourselves. It just feels better if you take it sublingually or snort it. About the same either way.",

Just my two cents. I agree with most of what you said though. It's actually a pretty sound theory. Oh and before I forget I was just reading an article somewhere that said at 16mg of buprenorphine, the opiate receptors in the brain are 94% saturated. so that's why respiratory depression is basically impossible on buprenorphine alone and also explains the ceiling effect.",

There is no rush or feeling at all. 15 mins later a nice feeling comes but it is never as strong as if I had just put it under my tongue.\n\nI suspect that the crucial thing is that when you take it sublingually there is high local concentration of buprenorphine in the mucosal cells of the mouth and more of it is converted to uncon norbupe. A high local concentration may be important for uncon norbupe to be made by the enzymes in the mouth. If you shoot it it gets spread out in the whole body and diluted to very low concentration. Many enzyme reactions are proportional to the concentration of the substrate. \n\nI have seen a simple study comparing bupe and it's metabolites for injected bupe and sublingual bupe. \n\nBuprenorphine, a powerful mixed agonist-antagonist analgesic which shows promise of providing maintenance pharmacotherapy for heroin addicts, is metabolized in male human subjects to norbuprenorphine and to conjugated buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine. Following subcutaneous, sublingual, and oral buprenorphine administration to a single subject, total metabolite excretion in urine was 2, 13.4, and 12.1%, respectively.\n\nAs you can see injecting means a lower ratio of full agonist norbupe and higher ratio partial agonist bupe. So if I am right about all this then the only thing that matters is the ratio of unconjugated norbupe and buprenorphine. Taking it sublingually has six or seven times as much norbupe than injecting! \n\nAnother study was using % of metabolites to predict weather patients would stay in treatment. They found patients who had higher metabolites were more likely to stay in treatment. If uncon norbupe is the main reason bupe feels good then it is no surprise people with low levels of metabolite dropped out of treatment. Patients with high levels of norbupe stayed in treatment because they felt better and craving went away.\n\nBasically I am thinking that bupe is really like codeine. A prodrug which has very little action itself but it's unconjugated metabolite is the main cause of the Mu agonism.\n\nsynonymous added 32 Minutes and 17 Seconds later...\n\nThis is from the Suboxone Data Sheet, 7 November 2014\n\nMetabolism and elimination\n\"In animals and man buprenorphine is metabolised by Phase 1 (oxidative) and Phase 2\n(conjugation) reactions. It is oxidatively metabolised by N-dealkylation to norbuprenorphine by CYP\n3A4. In in-vitro metabolic studies addition of specific inhibitors of CYP 3A4 (e.g. ketoconazole,\ngestodene, nifedipine, norfluoxetine, ritonavir) inhibited formation of norbuprenorphine (see also\nPRECAUTIONS and INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEDICINES). There was no indication of the\ninvolvement of CYP 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 2E1 in the N-dealkylation of\nbuprenorphine.

        "post_content": "Very interesting synonymous, this is some good stuff. I've definitely experimented alot with different ROA's for suboxone over the years, and to a much lesser extent generic buprenorphine tablets. Started using it IV, then switched to nasal for quite a few years, then switched to sublingual for quite a few more years. Have also done it orally and rectally.\n\nYour theory is very sound based on what I've felt. Although since I've only been using suboxone mainly, I threw it down to naloxone being partially responsible as well. But now looking back I don't think it would explain why sublingual is stronger than oral, assuming the naloxone is poorly bioavailable orally.\n\nOne thing you say is that its hard to understand why bupe is stronger than morphine but doesn't get you as high. It has to do with affinity of the receptor and its agonism. Buprenorphine has a very strong affinity for the receptors but is only a partial agonist. Things you already brought up though..\n\nI think your on to something here though. I've found that the strongest \"high\" or feel-good-effect that I can get from this substance is when I can keep it in my mouth for a long time without it dissolving in. I'll often take it when my mouth is at its driest so it sits there for a longer period of time. This usually involves taking it in the very early morning hours or after I have smoked cannabis.\n\nMy rule of thumb is this, and the corresponding effect seems to correlate. If I can still taste it a bit at an hour later, I will get a good effect. If my saliva washes it away within 30mins the effect is usually seriously lacking, and sometimes I'll end up taking a bit more. But sometimes I'll be able to taste it 1 1/2 to 2 hours later and if thats the case I feel that opiate feel good effect much stronger and longer.\n\nOne other thing that I do to ensure it stays in my mouth for a longer time is folding up the piece of sublingual strip as much as possible to have a chunk instead of a thin film.\n\nSo based on my \"experimentation\" over the years I would also conclude that the non-conjugated form of Norbuprenorphine formed in the mouth is superior, if that is actually the mystery to this all. It would also explain why all other routes feel inferior to sublingual for me now, but maybe naloxone has some part in that depending on the route.\n\nOne more thing I'd like to add, you bring up a study that goes over the percentages of metabolites present based on ROA. (Subcutaneous, oral, or sublingual.) Although it does show the difference between Subcutaneous and the other two, it doesn't really give you any indication as to the differences between oral and sublingual as you don't really know (based on that data alone) what metabolites they are talking about. Its still good though as you said, to show that injecting is a waste.\n\n-GC",

When I say bupe is stronger than morphine I don't mean the binding affinity. I mean the subjective and pain killing effect at low doses. I can take 2mg of bupe sublingually and get very good pain killing effect for a couple of hours. 2mg of morphine would be absolutely undetectable to me. So maybe the reason bupe can do this is not really bupe at all but is the unconjugated norbupe which is sometimes quotes as ten times stronger agonism than bupe. \n\n\" you bring up a study that goes over the percentages of metabolites present based on ROA.

Its still good though as you said, to show that injecting is a waste.\"\n\nYou are right we can't tell how much of those metabolites were active or inactive with that data. We can assume that the swollowed bupe went through first pass metabolism and was mostly conjugated. The interesting thing is that sublingual had even more metabolites than both injecting and swallowing. Unfortunately this was not much of a stuy and was just a test done on one person. We need more data.\n\n\nI am very interested in other peoples experiences so please guys post if this explanation fits your experiences or even if it doesn't fit your experiences too. There is variation in the population and my experiences may not match yours. But if this is the way it really works for most people then the more people who are aware of this the less people will waste their bupe trying in vein to get high...\n\nI find the best, strongest subjective effect for subutex is to put it behind my lips in front of my teeth and leave it as long as possible. I snort it sometimes but I wouldn't consider this ROA abuse. It is almost exactly the same as sublingual. Just a little more convenient because I don't have to worry about swallowing it by mistake. \n\nI used to have a very strong needle fixation but time and time again it would be obviously worse than sublingual so I would go back to sublingual. When I finally tried taking a CYP450 inducer 1 hour before taking my bupe and got much nicer full agonist feeling, I started to realize that the conventional understanding that cytochrome inducers would metabolise bupe to inactive conjugated norbupe must be wrong. I would never shoot my bupe now days because I understand why that would be less effective. It's shame the doctors don't know about all this and tell patients. There is no need to try to scare people with naloxone and misinformation.",

        "post_content": "It's hard to know where to begin with this topic. Well, maybe firstly \"stronger\" is a really bad word when used to compare opioids together. More often than not when that word is used what is actually meant is that one opioid is more potent than the other. In this case buprenorphine is way more potent than most opioids excluding fentanyl analogues and few others. This simply means that a lower dose is needed to achieve the same level of analgesia (pain killing effect). When taken at an equianalgesic dose most people would probably say that morphine is the more pleasurable of the two opioids. This also of course depends on the route of administration as the speed at which the full amount of drug gets into the receptor cites plays a big role on how pleasing the individual finds it. This is why so many people choose to snort oxycodone while in fact oxycodone has a higher bioavailability orally than nasally (meaning that more of the drug actually enters your blood stream and therefore to your brains).\n\nNow that I mentioned bioavailabilities I should point out that intranasal bioavailability for buprenorphine is higher than sublingual (about 50 % vs. 33 %, IV of course always being the full 100 %). I used to use buprenorphine recreationally via intranasal dosing of 1.5mg-2mg (this is when I was occasionally using opioids so had a decent base tolerance to them) and it would get me nice and high for a long time. One time at the end stages of my recreational use (which slowly progressed into addiction) I couldn't be bothered to go to the bathroom at a train so I just used my last 2mg sublingually and felt almost nothing. For a person with a low opioid tolerance buprenorphine produces a high which is like a full agonist high but if you continue using it, you will create tolerance to it and lose this effect. \n\nNow, that gets me to what it actually means when we say that buprenorphine is a partial agonist (of the mu opioid receptors which are responsible for analgesic and euphoric effects of opioids), it means that it binds to the receptors and activates them to a certain degree. In contrast a full agonist fully activates that same receptor (think of it like a door, buprenorphine opens it a bit while a full agonist kicks it fully open). This is why with a full agonist opioid you can just take more to get the same effects (speaking of which, I just did 280mg of oxycodone yesterday) but with buprenorphine once you hit a certain point, there just isn't anymore receptors to partially agonise so you won't get any higher. \n\nNow one thing that is unique about buprenorphine is that it binds to the receptors really strongly and that is why, if you have sufficient tolerance to full agonists and take a dose of buprenorphine, you will go to precipitated withdrawals. This is also what is believed to be the reason for norbuprenorphine not acting at the receptor cites. That has nothing to do with the fact that norbuprenorphine is eventually conjugated before it is excreted (in fact conjugation is how most opioids exit your system).\n\nThen there is the fact that buprenorphine doesn't produce a rush when injected (so I've heard, never tried it though as I don't inject) which can be explained by the fact that buprenorphine has \"slow receptro association\" (Source: Clinical Actions of Fentanyl and Buprenorphine - The Signifigance of Receptor Binding).\n\nSomeone who knows more about biochemistry can explain this all better, but this is just what I've gathered from years of reading medical texts (I do still have to go through the two you pointed out) and personal experience.\n\nedit: Just read the abastract of Comparison of Pharmacological Activities of Buprenorphine and Norbuprenorphine: Norbuprenorphine Is a Potent Opioid Agonist and it states:\n\n\"At \u03bc- and \u03ba-receptors, both norBUP and BUP were potent partial agonists, with norBUP having moderate efficacy and BUP having low efficacy.\" \n\nSo this tells us that norbuprenorphine is also a partial agonist of the mu opioid receptors whereas I previously thought it to be a full agonist.\n\nedit 2: While reading through the second abstract I came accross this: P-Cloprotein Is a Major Determinant of Norbuprenorphine Brain Exposure and Antinociception and that states:\n\n\"Results show that norbuprenorphine is an in vitro and in vivo substrate of P-glycoprotein. P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux influences brain access and antinociceptive, but not the respiratory, effects of norbuprenorphine.\"\n\nWhat that means in essence is, that even if the mu receptors in your brain weren't blocked by buprenorphine, P-glycoprotein would \"push\" the norbuprenorphine out of your brain very quickly so it wouldn't have time to actually bind into the mu opioid receptors to produce euphoric effects. \n\nAll in all, it seems that it is indeed the partial agonism of the mu opioid receptors by buprenorphine and not its metabolite that causes the euphoric effects when one takes buprenorphine (be it by any route of administration).",

        "post_content": "Hi Petri6 Thanks for the reply. I'm aware that my theory directly contradicts the official story we have been told about bupe. This is not because I don't understand the company line about how it is supposed to work. It is because my experiences don't match them at all. Thanks for the P-GP paper. At first I thought P-GP was transporting norbupe across the BBB into the brain but it only transports drugs outside the BBB. \nApparently some CYP450 inducers including the one I have been taking can also inhibit P-GP... Impossible to tell if this is significant. \n\n\nWhen an opiate binds to Mu receptors the neurons intracellular cAMP concentration goes down. cAMP is an indicator of the general metabolic rate within the cell. When intracellular cAMP levels are lower the action potential threshold is relatively higher than before the drug had bound and so the cell is less likely to depolarise and send a signal to other cells. So when morphine binds to a neuron the cAMP goes down X amount. When Buprenorphine binds the cAMP concentration does not go down as much. So bupe has a lower agonist effect at Mu receptors. Fine, but then why can I feel a stronger effect from 2mg of bupe for hours and not feel 2mg of morphine at all, if molecule for molecule morphine should have a stronger effect. It doesn't make sense.\n\nRespiratory depression associated with buprenorphine is related to its metabolite, norbuprenorphine, and not to the parent drug; paradoxically, buprenorphine prevents and reverses respiratory depression in rats that are given lethal injections of norbuprenorphine\n\nIt certainly gets more complicated the deeper I look into it. The slow receptor association could explain why it takes so long to work when IV. but so could the active metabolite explanation. \n\n\n\nHi Mer kaba\nI have tried a couple of times to change to suboxone. I my country I can't get take away doses of subutex so I have to go into the chemist every dam day. Unfortunately suboxone didn't work for me . It never felt good like subutex. They told me that naloxone does not absorb sublingually but whenever I tried to take suboxone I just felt a bit crappy for an hour or two and then never felt the nice feeling like subutex at all. I was craving dope all day when I was on suboxone and felt like I had been ripped off paying money for nothing. \nSome people say both types of subs feel the same but they sure don't feel the same to me. Sorry I can't help with naloxone. \n\nSo I don't have much experience with suboxone. The metabolism of naloxone is another whole can of worms really. I just googled it and naloxone is simply conjugated and excreted.",

        "post_content": "Again because agonism and affinity are too completely different things. Buprenorphine binds very tightly to the receptor because it has a much higher affinity for that receptor. Affinity has nothing to do with qualitative effects, just the potency of the material mg/mg. Stronger is not the right word to be using here because it mixes up your mind to thinking about both potency and what people consider \"good\" in terms of the high.\n\nMorphine isn't more potent it just feels better subjectively, and some people may then use the word \"stronger\" in an effort to convey how it feels. Everybodies definition of what feels good and what is qualitatively better differs, but potency of a substance will always be what it is.\n\nOne more thing I'd like to add, when I switched from intranasal to sublingual it did take me a while to adjust. For quite some time it felt like the sublingual was much weaker mg/mg compared to intranasal and I'd end up taking more than before. But the overall effect (agonism if you will haha) seemed better in the long run once my body adjusted to the differing potency. I always threw this down to being better bioavailability for nasal, but also higher BA for the naloxone too which in my mind could have decreased the overall positive effects. It could also work towards your theory though. (If Petri didn't shoot holes all through it..)\n\n-GC",

The risk of drug abuse should also be considered (see 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use).\n\n- Other central nervous system depressants; other opioid derivatives (analgesics and antitussives); certain antidepressants, sedative H1-receptor antagonists, barbiturates, anxiolytics other than benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, clonidine and related substances.

Indeed, buprenorphine could both protect against and reverse norbuprenorphine-induced respiratory depression in rats\n\nsynonymous added 152 Minutes and 42 Seconds later...\n\nI'm on a roll, the evidence is stacking up... \n\nMetabolism of buprenorphine to norbuprenorphine was initially considered to be an inactivation pathway, because norbuprenorphine had one-fiftieth the analgesic potency (based on dose) of buprenorphine in animal models [56]. Nevertheless, it is now known that norbuprenorphine is a potent opioid agonist, with high affinities for \u03bc-, \u03b4-, and \u03ba-opioid receptors [57]. Norbuprenorphine is a partial \u03bc- and \u03ba-opioid agonist and a full \u03b4-opioid agonist [57]. Buprenorphine is a partial \u03bc-opioid agonist and a \u03b4-opioid antagonist and has demonstrated variable effects on the \u03ba-opioid receptor [57]. Norbuprenorphine causes dose-dependent respiratory depression and is 10 times more potent than buprenorphine in this regard [58]. On the basis of the consideration that norbuprenorphine concentrations in plasma are greater than those of buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine is considered to have significant clinical effects and potential for respiratory depression and may be considered to be a bioactivation rather than an inactivation pathway. \n\nsynonymous added 11 Minutes and 51 Seconds later...\n\nComparison of cerebral pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine in an in vivo sheep model.\n\nAbstract\nThe pharmacokinetics and time course of blood-brain equilibration of buprenorphine (BUP) and norbuprenorphine (norBUP) in sheep were characterized. Sheep were administered 0.04 mg kg(-1) BUP or 0.6 mg kg(-1) norBUP as 4-min i.v. infusions. The cerebral kinetics were inferred from arterio-sagittal sinus concentration gradients and changes in cerebral blood flow. These data were fitted to physiologically based pharmacokinetic models. BUP cerebral kinetics were best described by a membrane-limited model with a large equilibration delay (half-life of 20 min) between brain and blood due to intermediate permeability (47 ml min(-1)) and a large cerebral distribution volume (595 ml). Significant limitation in permeability (6 ml min(-1)) characterized the cerebral kinetics of norBUP with a cerebral distribution volume (157 ml) giving a blood-brain equilibration half-life (21 min) similar to that for BUP. The logD of BUP and norBUP were 3.93 +/- 0.08 and 1.18 +/- 0.04 (mean +/- SD), respectively. Both compounds revealed slow cerebral equilibration with variations in degree of permeability and distribution volume reflecting the difference in lipophilicity. It is possible that norBUP contributes to the central effects seen after chronic BUP administration as this study demonstrated its entry into the brain.",

        "post_content": "Isn't this the same reason that loperamide isn't a crazy strong painkiller like it's structural analogues, it is easily pushed out of the brain by P-glycoprotein? Maybe if one were interested in experiencing the central effect of norbuprenorphine it would help to take whatever potentiating supplements they take when they get high on Immodium (that is, those who actually do). Obviously just overwhelming the mechanism won't work, unless one wanted to take 60-200x the normal dose of bupe like some folks do with loperamide.\n\nBe aware, norbupe has been shown to produce rather strong respiratory depression, so a successful trial with it would involve the risk of a classic opioid OD. Although, in theory if one did OD on their metabolically produced norbupe, someone could simply administer more buprenorphine to pull them out of it (I remember being told that bupe has higher affinity and will therefore remove norbupe from your receptors like that sneak Lucy taking away Charlie's football.\n\nAll this is theoretical of course, and very complicated. Bupe's pharmacokinetics are highly irregular and unpredictable. It also creates one hell of a habit in some people,especially those on high doses or who play with alternate ROAs. I've kicked cold turkey once at 2 mg, and for two weeks I felt like shit (not \"I haven't had my daily gram shot of china and I'm out of toilet like objects in my house to abuse, but psychologically drained and dark, very fatigued, always cold and sweaty, no appetite, couldn't sleep without taking major tranquilizers like olanzapine. It was no fun, and if that's 2 mg I shudder to imagine CTing off of 16.) and had very bad post acute withdrawal. The depression was really bad, the high affinity and potency of bupe causes long lasting changes in receptor density and alters the subjective experience of enjoyment and pleasure until the brain recovers. Mine never did, I just ended up back on it, something which happens quite a bit. I won't out and out say Subs are a well-meaning but still damaging scam played on addicts to make money (and hell, it keeps them clean so everybody wins!) and keep them on the \"correct\" dope as opposed to the stuff they used to use, that would make me cynical and paranoid. But it wouldn't exactly be out of character for drug companies to pull something like that. Anyway, it has advantages and disadvantages, but I can say definitively that if a life without bupe is possible in someone in recovery from opioids, then it is the right choice.\n\nI wish I had just detoxed cold from the beginning and never heard of Suboxone. At least it helps ensure abstinence from opioids. Hmph.",

Rea the study below...\n\nJust wondering can you get subutex? DOes it feel the same as suboxone to you? I am happy on subutex sublingual and don't feel the need to increase the effect. I can imagine that a high dose of subutex would feel the same as a high dose of suboxone as the receptors are blockaded by bupe and the norbupe cannot get enough receptors.\n\nI found an article about retro viral proton pump inhibitors causing bupe to metabolize quicker and the patient was getting too high. It was one of the reason they have started to realise they were wrong about norbupe being inactive...\n\nComparison of cerebral pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine in an in vivo sheep model.\n\nAbstract\nThe pharmacokinetics and time course of blood-brain equilibration of buprenorphine (BUP) and norbuprenorphine (norBUP) in sheep were characterized. Sheep were administered 0.04 mg kg(-1) BUP or 0.6 mg kg(-1) norBUP as 4-min i.v. infusions. The cerebral kinetics were inferred from arterio-sagittal sinus concentration gradients and changes in cerebral blood flow. These data were fitted to physiologically based pharmacokinetic models. BUP cerebral kinetics were best described by a membrane-limited model with a large equilibration delay (half-life of 20 min) between brain and blood due to intermediate permeability (47 ml min(-1)) and a large cerebral distribution volume (595 ml). Significant limitation in permeability (6 ml min(-1)) characterized the cerebral kinetics of norBUP with a cerebral distribution volume (157 ml) giving a blood-brain equilibration half-life (21 min) similar to that for BUP. The logD of BUP and norBUP were 3.93 +/- 0.08 and 1.18 +/- 0.04 (mean +/- SD), respectively. Both compounds revealed slow cerebral equilibration with variations in degree of permeability and distribution volume reflecting the difference in lipophilicity. It is possible that norBUP contributes to the central effects seen after chronic BUP administration as this study demonstrated its entry into the brain.\n\n\nI would suggest not to worry about the blood brain barrier just take an CYP450 inducer a hour or two before your subutex sublingual and enjoy . It works for me anyway.\n\nsynonymous added 24 Minutes and 40 Seconds later...\n\nJust found this. It turns out that norbupe inhibits P-GP as a substrate.

The limited data obtained using in-vitro models indicate that methadone, buprenorphine, and cannabinoids may interact with human P-gp; but almost nothing is known about drugs of abuse and BCRP. We used in vitro P-gp and BCRP inhibition flow cytometric assays with hMDR1- and hBCRP-transfected HEK293 cells to test 14 compounds or metabolites frequently involved in addiction, including buprenorphine, norbuprenorphine, methadone, ibogaine, cocaine, cocaethylene, amphetamine, N-methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, nicotine, ketamine, Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), naloxone, and morphine. Drugs that in vitro inhibited P-gp or BCRP were tested in hMDR1- and hBCRP-MDCKII bidirectional transport studies. Human P-gp was significantly inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by norbuprenorphine>buprenorphine>methadone>ibogaine and THC. Similarly, BCRP was inhibited by buprenorphine>norbuprenorphine>ibogaine and THC. None of the other tested compounds inhibited either transporter, even at high concentration (100 microm). Norbuprenorphine (transport efflux ratio approoximately 11) and methadone (transport efflux ratio approoximately 1.9) transport was P-gp-mediated; however, with no significant stereo-selectivity regarding methadone enantiomers. BCRP did not transport any of the tested compounds. However, the clinical significance of the interaction of norbuprenorphine with P-gp remains to be evaluated.\n\nsynonymous added 9 Minutes and 56 Seconds later...\n\nWell it just keeps coming...\n\nHere is a study done to see if P450 induction results in higher ratio of norbupe to bupe.It does.\n\nIn rats at least it does not respiratory depression.

However, in rats, intravenous buprenorphine at doses up to 90 mg kg(-1) was not associated with significant effects on arterial blood gases. In contrast, norbuprenorphine, the buprenorphine major cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A-derived metabolite, is a potent respiratory depressant. Thus, our aim was to study the consequences of CYP3A induction on buprenorphine-associated effects on resting ventilation in rats. We investigated the effects on ventilation of 30 mg kg(-1) buprenorphine alone or following cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A induction with dexamethasone, using whole body plethysmography (N=24) and arterial blood gases (N=12). Randomized animals in 4 groups received sequential intraperitoneal dosing with: (dexamethasone [days 1-3]+buprenorphine [day 4]), (dexamethasone solvent [days 1-3]+buprenorphine [day 4]), (dexamethasone [days 1-3]+buprenorphine solvent [day 4]), or (dexamethasone solvent [days 1-3]+buprenorphine solvent [day 4]). Buprenorphine alone caused a significant rapid and sustained increase in the inspiratory time (P<0.001), without significant effects on the respiratory frequency, the tidal volume, the minute volume, or arterial blood gases. In dexamethasone-pretreated rats, there was no significant alteration in the respiratory parameters, despite CYP3A induction and significant increase of the ratio of plasma norbuprenorphine-to-buprenorphine concentrations. In conclusion, dexamethasone did not modify the effects of 30 mg kg(-1) buprenorphine on rat ventilation. Our results suggest a limited role of drug-mediated CYP3A induction in the occurrence of buprenorphine-attributed respiratory depression in addicts.",

In Canada we choose or are given suboxone or methadone (in my area) but I am curious to why we don't have subutex or access to it.\nThe reason I ask this is because I know several female friends who got pregnant while on treatment with suboxone and instead of switching them to subutex (which is not available or barely heard of) they were instantly switched to methadone and worked up in milligrams.\nTheuy have to spend close to a year on methadone and a lot could not wait to get back on suboxone but by the time of delivery they were up too 100+ mg daily. Then they have to do the switch from methadone to suboxone which most fail and end up on methadone.\nNot saying one is better than the other but why do women maintained on suboxone get put on methadone when they get pregnant and not offered subutex or can even get it.\nI read through special access you can get it in Canada so has anyone been given subutex in Canada when becoming pregnant or for any reason? Just curious\nUpdate: I have done some research and Subutex IS available in Canada through the 'Health Canada Special Access Program\". For whatever reason, if you need to stop suboxone but want to stick with buprenorphine you need to speak to the doctor giving you suboxone and ask him for a prescription for Subutex and apply through the special access program. Based on your assessment and need of said drug, you can get authorization for subutex here in Canada.\nJust some info. for those on opioid therapy who need to stop suboxone (usually pregnancy or adverse reaction) can still continue with buprenorphine products.\nhttps://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/special-access/drugs.html\nThat is the link for Canadians looking to get access to subutex.",

        "post_content": "Wow! Interesting information. That\u2019s so f*cked up that the first line of treatment for a pregnant woman on suboxone is to switch her to methadone instead of plain buprenorphine/subutex! At least it\u2019s actually available but guess what, the women who are poor and have fewer resources are probably the once\u2019s who don\u2019t know to ask and end up having to go on methadone for no legitimate reason.\n\nIn the US, I think the rules differ by state and different providers offer different options. For example, when I first went on buprenorphine, I went to a clinic that only prescribed buprenorphine products. All they did was piss tests, brief doctors visits and write prescriptions. It was pretty much like a pill mill type place. They didn\u2019t even have counseling. They just had a guy who would reprimanded you if you had a dirty drug screen. Anyway, they started me on plain, generic buprenorphine - no naloxone. And guess what? It was waaay cheaper than suboxone or even generic buprenorphine/naloxone.\n\nI eventually relapsed and never went back. I had accumulated a bunch of buprenorphine and wasn\u2019t even worried about running out of heroin at that time because I figured I had plenty of buprenorphine as a fall back. But that didn\u2019t turn out to be a reality. So I sought out a private doctor.\n\nThe private doctor SWORE by buprenorphine/naloxone! He would NOT give me buprenorphine because he said it had a higher potential for abuse. It was annoying but I stuck with him for about a year union I had to go on methadone for other reasons. However, he told me he WOULD prescribe buprenorphine alone, if and only if I became pregnant. No special forms would have been required.\n\nPersonally, I would have preferred my private doctor continue to give me buprenorphine without naloxone because it doesn\u2019t make sense to me to take additional drugs unless they have a beneficial purpose. I was so nervous at first that it would be different, that I\u2019d feel the naloxone. But I didn\u2019t. The tablet was more expensive though, which sucked! And it was a little larger and harder to dissolve under my tongue .\n\nI tend to agree with the argument that the naloxone in buprenorphine does not provide the societal benefit it\u2019s suppose to meet. From what I\u2019ve read, mostly here on DF, it hardly deters injection if at all. It\u2019s intended to scare people and make prescribers and governments - like Canada apparently - feel like they\u2019re preventing opioid drug diversion. But I read an article in NYT, published in 2013, that suboxone was among the top diverted prescription drugs at the time. It\u2019s probably still:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/...KsXclSkiSTAqvq1bj1sVhx6Q1x50tC&smid=url-share",

It\u2019s nothing new, I\u2019ve known that naloxone was pointless and redundant to add to buprenorphine for some 20 years now. The justification of adding naloxone to Suboxone was purposely meant to deceive people through the use of bad and/or incredibly manipulated science.\nhttps://drugs-forum.com/threads/rec...s-of-adding-naloxone-to-buprenorphine.357731/\n\nThe only reason that naloxone was ever added to a perfectly good Subutex was not because it made the drug safer or better or harder to abuse by addicts in anyway, the only reason for adding it was pure unadulterated greed. The moment Suboxone was approved and introduced to the world, is the precise moment when the \u201copioid epidemic\u201d switched from pharmaceutical companies handing out dangerous and addictive opioids like candy, to those exact same pharmaceutical companies handing out dangerous and addictive opioids to treat the now millions of junkies they had personally created!\n\nThe whole story of Purdue\u2019s OxyContin and the Sackler family to Reckitt Benckiser\u2019s Subutex and Suboxone and the Sackler family is truly fascinating from my journalist perspective on one hand. On the other hand, it\u2019s truly fucking tragic for the millions of people that are now enslaved (often permanently) to the same pharmaceutical company that got them addicted in the first place, to now being fucked again and harder by handcuffing these junkies to their \u201caddiction treatment drugs\u201d that realistically have no real hope (like 3% of people) ever getting off of them.\n\nJust a follow up to that NYT article that you posted above, and that lawsuit against Suboxone maker Reckitt Benckiser @BirdJungle.\n\nhttp://consumer.ftc.gov/consumer-al...-suboxoner-film-you-may-be-eligible-get-money\n\nIt might be that people reading this could still be entitled to some of that settlement against the makers of Suboxone?

Also, you do not have to deal with the precision cutting of film or using tablets to estimate dosages. This method works well with film but can also be employed using tablets. The ratio of dose verses fluid volume will vary depending on what strength medication you are starting with and what amount of liquid you use. It\u2019s all straightforward, basic math. This article lays out the most commonly used concentration.\n\nTools:\n\n\nBach\u2019s Rescue Remedy - Dark Bottle 10 ml (thoroughly cleaned and dried).\n1 ml/1 cc syringes, package of 6 (no needle)\nVodka, or any high proof, clear food quality liquor will work (make sure it doesn\u2019t have sugar in it). I found the strips will dissolve more quickly and thoroughly using alcohol but you can use filtered water. If using water it will need to be refrigerated, an alcohol solution does not. I found the strips just didn\u2019t dissolve as well in water. If you have reasons that you\u2019d prefer not to use alcohol, others have reported using mouthwash (with alcohol) worked great and was very tolerable and pleasant.\nCotton Balls\nScissors\nTweezers\nMagnifying glass, or a magnification App on your phone works great (quickly hit iPhone home button 3 times and it becomes a magnifying glass) or a Jewelers Loupe (this is what I used). The small .01 mg incremental lines are very difficult to see, especially if you suffer from eyestrain.\nMixing Solution:\n\nDry your hands thoroughly. Get a plate and cut your 8 mg film into 8 equal strips (avoid letting them touch each other as they might stick). If you\u2019re using 2 mg strips, get 4 and cut them in 1 mg pieces until you have 8. They\u2019ll fit into the bottle easier if they\u2019re small.\n\nGet your bottle and squirt 4 full syringes of 1 ml each of alcohol into it.\n\nDrop your strips into the bottle one at a time. If they stick at the top use a toothpick or something to stuff them in the bottle.\n\nAgain, squirt 4 more full syringes of 1 ml each of alcohol into the bottle.\n\nNow you\u2019ve got 8 mg\u2019s of sub in 8 ml\u2019s of solution.\n\nSo, 1 mg of sub = 1 ml of solution and 1/10 ml = .01 mg of sub.\n\nShake well until they are all dissolved. Also shake your bottle every time prior to dosing.\n\nPut one 1 syringe aside and only use it for the purpose of filling the bottle with liquid. As you use another syringe for dosing, over time the 1 ml line at the top will disappear due to handling it so many times so you'll need to use a new one from time to time.\n\nRinse the syringe after each dose. The syringes will become a bit sticky after a while. That\u2019s why you need more syringes so that the syringe moves smoothly as you pull up your dose.\n\nHow to Begin:\n\nStart with the liquid method only after you\u2019ve stabilized on 1 mg a day of physical film. It\u2019s easy to cut and chop the film until you get to around 1 mg. Also, above 1 mg there\u2019s just too much liquid. With a larger volume of liquid it\u2019s likely you can lose some to swallowing. You can dose twice per day, for example, .5 mg AM & .5 mg PM = 1 mg total or once a day. Most people do better with a two times a day schedule and it\u2019s less liquid, especially in the early stages of the taper.\n\nMake sure that you\u2019re stabilized and switch to the liquid method on the same dose you were on before. Do not try to switch and drop your dose simultaneously. This creates too many variables at once. You need to see how the switch to liquid affects you at first. It could feel stronger or weaker. You need to find out for yourself and adjust accordingly.\n\nAt first, the liquid may seem weaker than the physical film. Take time to adjust before dropping in dose, weeks if needed.\n\nTechnique:\n\nDraw up some liquid and then squirt it back into the bottle. This will get out any air bubbles. Place the syringe back into the bottle and draw up the amount of milligrams or micrograms that you need to take. Use your scissors to cut a small piece of cotton, and then stretch it out thinly so it\u2019s porous and the liquid remains in the fibers. Use the tweezers to place the cotton under your tongue. Slowly squirt the liquid into the cotton.\n\nHold the dose for as long as you usually do. Spit the cotton into a plastic baggy to be safely disposed of. If you have small children or pets you don\u2019t want the cotton to fall on the floor and jeopardize them.\n\nI strongly recommend keeping a daily journal of your dosages. You have to know how much you\u2019re taking and for how many days. This keeps you in control of your taper, and it\u2019s easy to lose track of.\n\nA good rule of thumb is to drop 10% every 10 to 14 days. Adjust as you see fit. You have to be flexible while tapering. If 14 days doesn\u2019t do it, hold for more days or as needed.\n\nListen to your body. It will tell you what to do.",

I was on methadone long time ago and I honestly thought more than on one occasion of going back on just to get off this last bit of subs.\n\nI got off methadone very easily tapering slow. Got down to last 1mg and never went back. Never experienced any withdrawal and I was on clinic for 2 years with dose being as high as 85.\n\nFunny you mention good insurance cause I have amazing insurance but the clinics here in Ma only take Ma health, they don\u2019t accept private insurances like tufts, bcbs etc. so that means 150 a week and they treat you like a pos and nothing against groups and meetings but I haven\u2019t touched my drug of choice in 15 years. I don\u2019t drink or do any drugs anymore. Quit cigarettes everything. I have to many health issues to even go there. I know I could get sucked in but it would have to be something very drastic, cause my health is what my main concern is now not getting high. \n\nI work a full time job and last time I called to inquire the lady had such a bad attitude and said why don\u2019t you just stay on suboxone otherwise your going to have to come everyday and do groups and individual counseling etc. at least at clinic they do the dosing, me on suboxone feel like I\u2019m\nGonna dose myself forever. \n\nIt sucks cause sometimes I feel I need to do something else to get off this shit. It\u2019s like the buprenorphine no matter how small the dose will eventually hold you like your doing a higher dose as far as getting off, if that makes sense",

Anyway this great and I will save this great info for the future. Much appreciated. And yes, less IS more with sub. I want to bang my head against the wall when I hear anything more than 4 mgs.

Her story is in a different forum but here is the first liquid taper that lead to the one above. Thank you Sindysun...\n\nLiquid Taper...\n\nUse either pills or films. Equal amounts of liquid (vodka is what I use but may use a mixture of water and alcohol too). If you use only water make sure you refrigerate in between doses. Don't use alcohol with sugar in it because it starts to harden at the top and it's annoying.\nStrips or pills work. I prefer strips.\n\nObtain a small bottle like the one for rescue remedy. Google it if you don't know what it is. You can order it or get from pharmacies or vitamin/supplement stories.\nAlso obtain a 1ml/cc syringe such as a U-100 or U-50 insulin syringe or get a neonatal/infant syringe for administrating very low doses of oral meds.\nIf using an insulin syringe remove needle. Grab it at the bottom with plyers or scissors and pull out or just break it off at the bottom. Discard in a closed container so no one gets stuck.\nPut 1ml fluid per each 1mg of sub in the bottle shake and allow to dissolve (8mg sub to 8ml vodka). Use the syringe to draw up one ml at a time so your measurements are precise.\nThe measurements for liquid are equivalent to the dose of sub you are taking so if you are taking .2mg of sub then you would draw up to the 20 or 2 line depending on your syringe. If you're taking .72mg then go to first little line After 70. Each small line represents .02mg of sub now. The full syringe with a 100ml syringe is 1mg.\n\nShake bottle each time you draw up dose especially with pills bc some settles on the bottom.",

I think it\u2019s interesting to note that it\u2019s buprenorphine administered buccally, meaning the small square of film is placed inside the cheek to dissolve in the patient\u2019s mouth.\n\nWhile the medication is buprenorphine, similar to subutex, it\u2019s prescribed for chronic pain, as opposed to opioid addiction. The biggest difference aside from administration in the cheek instead of under the tongue, is that it\u2019s prescribed in micrograms, with the highest dose being 900 mcg and the lowest 75 mcg, to be taken twice daily.\n\nThis is a lot different than the doses prescribed for addiction, which typically top out at 32 mg per day, but are more commonly 16 mg per day. \n\nHowever when tapering down, having easy access to those lower doses via Belbuca would be a great benefit to people. I think the lowest suboxone dose formulation is 2 mg strips. I don\u2019t know if they make a 2 mg tablet. They really should make it easier to taper by providing these lower doses to addiction patients, so they don\u2019t have to make special home concoctions. There\u2019s no reason not to do it, especially if therapeutic doses are prescribed in micrograms already for pain patients.",

        "post_content": "@Jason707 Thanks for clarifying. Some other details might be helpful too:\nHow often did you use?\nHow much typically did you use on a daily basis?\nHave you ever used a buprenorphine product for addiction before, like subutex, suboxonne? If so, how many times and did you ever relapse and go back on buprenorphine?\n\nAre you familiar with the clinical opioid withdrawal scale (COWS)? In a lot of cases, the scale works to assess whether you\u2019re ready to make the switch. I\u2019d shoot for a score around 15 and don\u2019t overestimate your symptoms. It\u2019s better to wait as long as you can possibly stand it before placing the first little bit of buprenorphine under your tongue.\n\nI\u2019m really curious about the length of time it takes for your withdrawal to hit. You don\u2019t feel any symptoms for a day and a half? Wow! Has it always been like that for you? Or is it the type of \u201cheroin\u201d you\u2019ve been using?\n\nI\u2019d be really cautious about taking the buprenorphine until you\u2019re miserable. Precipitated withdrawal is so much worse than regular withdrawal.",

In rehabs/detox facilities, they wait at the very least 72 hours before inducting suboxone if patients test positive for fentanyl. It might be wise to get a cheap fentanyl urine test (Amazon sells them for 15 bucks, but Walmart has them cheap too).\n\nIf you are still testing positive for fentanyl, than hold off until you test negative to avoid dangerous precipitated withdrawal. Some heavy addicts will still test positive for fentanyl even after 2 weeks or longer after abstaining (this is due to fentanyl being very lipophilic, like THC is, and stores excess fentanyl in fat cells).\n\nGood luck and let us know here how it goes!\n\nZadkiel",

Usually it was tan, or sandy brown, sometimes gray, occasionally off-white, more like cream colored powder or rocks that crushed to powder. The only time I got pure white dope it contained ZERO heroin and was positive for fentanyl. \n\nDefinitely if you don\u2019t start to withdrawal for two days, stay the hell away from buprenorphine until you really feel sick. I wonder if you could taper though if your withdrawal is so slow to manifest? I mean part of the reason suboxone is used for maintenance is because patients can go so long between doses.\n\nWere you taking buprenorphine before your relapse, or just now consider it? Do you have a doctor to help you with withdrawal symptoms while you wait, on in case you get precipitated withdrawal? 72 hours should be ok but buprenorphine is weird, or rather the opioid drugs on the street are weird and sometimes unpredictable with buprenorphine.",

When the Buprenorphine wears off, you\u2019ll be in withdrawal again, I\u2019m thinking.\n\nIf you took a full antagonist like naloxone, maybe you\u2019d get the results you\u2019re after, but I\u2019m fairly certain it would not be a pleasant experience. Probably more comfortable to go through normal withdrawal. It might not be as bad as you\u2019re expecting, especially if it\u2019s only been a month since you started up again.",

        "post_content": "Oh well. If that\u2019s the case, kick the codeine, wait a few weeks and then you won\u2019t have as much tolerance. If you get withdrawals when you don\u2019t take codeine, you definitely do not want to take Buprenorphine! Precipitated withdrawal is not fun by any stretch of the imagination. It happens fast too. You won\u2019t get high first.\n\nIf you wait until you are in moderate withdrawals to take the Buprenorphine, you\u2019ll likely avoid precipitated withdrawal. You\u2019d be taking it like it\u2019s intended, for opiate replacement. If that\u2019s what you want, that would be a safe approach but you\u2019ll still withdraw once you\u2019re off the Buprenorphine. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get high when you take the Buprenorphine, but it\u2019ll definitely give you temporary relief from codeine withdrawal. I\u2019ve never taken Buprenorphine for a high and I was pretty deeply addicted to opiates, primarily heroin, the first time I took it. So I could be wrong about your potential for getting a high once you\u2019ve waited long enough to be in withdrawal from the codeine. To me it doesn\u2019t seem worth the trouble of going into withdrawal or the risk of precipitated withdrawal due to bad timing.\n\nI\u2019ve had precipitated withdrawal when I took Buprenorphine too early before boarding a flight. What a nightmare! I was addicted to heroin at the time and was afraid to take it on the plane so I was going to take my Buprenorphine (which I was supposed to be taking anyway) during my trip. I was way too sick to fly, even the next day. I was sick for a few days and so mad at myself because I got more sick than if I quit cold turkey. But I wasn\u2019t free from opiate addiction because I was on Buprenorphine. And I missed a wedding. It was really depressing and I went back to using heroin.\n\nNot sure how bad the precipitated withdrawal would be after a month of codeine, but I don\u2019t think I would want to find out. Pretty much take your normal withdrawal and multiply by 5. Maybe it would be a little shorter than typical withdrawal... if you keep taking Buprenorphine. You only have 8 mg though so I can\u2019t tell you long it would take to recover without taking more opiates or opioids. I\u2019ve taken heroin to stop precipitated withdrawal but I don\u2019t think codeine is strong enough to counteract Buprenorphine.",

It turns out, that the headaches are most likely to be attributed to buprenorphine side effects alone, and the naloxone had no effect at all, and was digested without any known drug action at all, because of the complete blocking effects of buprenorphine to block most opioid agonists and antagonists to bind to those receptors.\n\nI did not find any difference in subutex and suboxone, and came to the conclusion that it was the buprenorphine that was causing my unacceptable side-effects.\n\nZadkiel",

I ended up switching to methadone because I had failed back surgery and I was told that methadone was better at pain management (because it is a full MU agonist compared to buprenorphine\u2019s partial agonist activity).\n\nI had to go to a pain management clinic for my methadone (it ended up being 120 mg a day to help with pain management). It worked marginally better than buprenorphine, but being a pain management clinic I broke the rules by smoking pot and was forced to go cold turkey from 120 mg of methadone to nothing. The withdrawals took well over a year to subside, and I swore off all opioids as a treatment for any chronic pain situation from then on! The risks way out way the benefits ime!\n\nZadkiel",

        "post_content": "I'm not sure about the generic you tried but I have I have been given 2 different forms (besides Indivior brand name Suboxone) of generic buprenorphine/naloxone (Canadian here). The Indivior brand name Suboxone which I usually get sometimes isn't there and I've gotten generics. \nThe only two generics (available here to my knowledge) are HI-Tech pharma (an arrow on one side and N8 on the other side), and the other is made by Actavis Elizabeth LLC (with a half moon on one side and the number 155 on the opposite side). Besides the Indivior brand (which work the best IMO) I have found the HI-Tech pharma generic to be significantly weaker than the brand. I took them for a week and the lessened effects (although not noticeable totally) get worse by the 3rd or 4th day and I didn't even believe it was buprenorphine at the end of it. \nA few months later I was given another generic (the Actavis) brand with the half moon symbol and 155 on back. I was not happy because I expected the same as the last generic but trusting my doctor and pharmacist I took them. I found these had a stronger orange taste than the brand. I felt them working and I felt like I did when I first starting taking the Indivior brand Suboxone. The only thing was the Actavis generics gave me a slight headache for about an hour after dosing but felt the headache was not from lack of efficiency but more of it. I actually slept through the night and felt the effects to last the full day. \n\nMaybe it was a break from the Indivior brand but the Actavis generic (which are a lot cheaper) were (IMO) up to par with the Indivior brand name Suboxone. I am now going to speak to my pharmacist and see if we can create a schedule so I can switch back and forth from Indivior to Actavis (to save money but also because they both work for me 100% but are slightly different in effects). \nI read somewhere that generics have to be synthesized to contain between 80%-125% of the active ingredient(s) in order to be effective and to be considered a substitution. I understand the need to set limits but 80-125%? Which means one generic suboxone may only be 80% in potency which means one 8 mg tablet/film would only provide 6.4 mg in reality while another generic could be 125% in potency (in reference to the brand name drug) and one 8 mg tablet/film could contain 10 mg. \nSo in regards to generics, some 8 mg tablets/films can legally only contain 6.4 mg while another generic (of the exact same 8 mg drug) could contain 10 mg of the active substance(s). This could make it even worse for someone who is taking the Actavis generic and are switched to the HI-Tech pharma brand.\n80%-125% is a huge variation at 45%. Just say for example two generics of the same drug are made (one with 80% active ingredients and one with 125%), that could easily mean the difference between relapse or recovery even in patients stabilized on buprenorphine/naloxone for years. \nJust another experience I want to share with anyone who needs it and my advice to anyone on suboxone/buprenorphine treatment is to not be afraid of telling your doctor or pharmacist if one isn't working for you and asking if other generics are available. \nOne last thing I forgot to add: I have heard that if you are given a generic that doesn't work like the previous, increasing your dosage slightly may be needed to get the effects from previous generics/brands. IMO and IME I have found that increasing the dosage has not worked for me when switching generics. The effectiveness was not dependent on the dose but the brand but that is MY opinion and experience. Don't forget to speak up if something is wrong as it's YOUR recovery and YOU are the one in charge of your recovery and your body knows what works.\nBest of luck in your journey",

        "post_content": "There is no safe way to inject Subutex (also known as buprenorphine or 'bupe'), as it has been designed to be taken orally. This guide is intended to reduce the risks for people who insist on injecting Subutex. \n\n\nWhy injecting Subutex is dangerous\n\n\nIf you intend to inject your Subutex tablets you need to be aware of the potentially serious risks involved. You also need to be aware that this medication is only designed to be dissolved under your tongue - if you do intend to inject a Subutex tablet you have to have the skills to transform a solid substance into an injectable solution. This is more difficult than most people think and takes time and the correct use of specific equipment.\n\nWhen you inject buprenorphine or 'bupe', it doesn\u2019t last as long in your body as when you dissolve it under your tongue as prescribed, you may start \u201changing out\u201d and go into withdrawal quite a while before you can get your next dose. If you get caught diverting your dose there may be a lot of penalties coming your way from the clinic; as in no more take away doses, an enforced change of pharmacy, dose changes etc. \n\nInjecting can lead to vein problems, hepatitis C and HIV/AIDS. Safer shooting techniques can reduce these risks. If you still choose to inject, here is a guide to reduce some of the risks involved. \n\nEquipment needed to inject bupe\n\nUse new, clean equipment with each shot. Never share your equipment.\n\nSterile water \n\nMixing bowl or teaspoon \n\nSyringes\n\nTwo 3ml syringes\n\n'Drawing up' needle\n\nIdeally a 19 guage needle, able to draw up your mix into the barrel\n\nCotton wool or cotton filters\n\nA wheel filter\n\nFind out more about wheel filters and how to use them. You can also use a butterfly if you have multiple barrels.\n\nSwabs\n\nUse these to clean your equipment and injection sites. Wipe them in one direction, once only. Wait for the area to dry - it is the drying action that kills germs.\n\nSoap\n\nClean your preparation areas, and hands before and after using to reduce the risks of blood borne diseases like hepatitis C and HIV/AIDS. \n\nTourniquet\n\nMake sure you clean this with soap before and after use and never share. Click here to read up more on tourniquet use. \n\nSafe disposal bottle\n\nThis should come with your gear from the NSP. It is illegal not to use one with used injecting equipment! \n\nStep one\n\nBefore you begin it is extremely important that you know where the Subutex came from. Only use tablets that you have removed from the packet. If the Subutex has been \u201cdiverted\u201d from anyone\u2019s mouth; including your own, do not inject it. Even small traces of saliva can permanently harm your health and destroy veins.\nWash or swab your hands and preparation area. Swab out the spoon or bowl you are going to crush the Subutex tablets into. Crush the tablets as fine as you can, then begin to gradually mix sterile water into the crushed tablets. Mix the water and the crushed tablets thoroughly.\n\nDiluting your mix is VERY important; dilution means adding sterilised water when you are crushing up your tablet. \n\nWhen you dilute your drugs by adding water, it does not mean you will dilute the effects of the drug. It simply makes it easier to filter any undesirable substances out of your mix, which will also help to keep your veins healthier.\n\nThe more sterile water you add, the better the filtering. The sterile water you use for dilution must be room temperature only, never use warm or hot water. Subutex tablets are not a chalk-based tablet like the majority of pills you may have tried to inject. Subutex utilises maize starch to form a tablet. Therefore it may be necessary to utilise different techniques to break Subutex down into an injectable solution.\n\nStep two\n\nDo not heat the mix! Subutex has a maize starch base, rather than being a chalk-based tablet which is more common. If you heat the mix you will make something akin to gravy! \n\nDraw up the mix through cotton filters into a syringe with a 19 gauge tip. Repeat this process as many times as it takes until you have a milky looking fluid. Set the mix aside on a sterile surface.\n\nStep three\n\nPrepare (aka \u2018prime\u2019) the wheel filter for use: (slowly inject 1ml of sterile water from a 3 ml syringe through the wheel filter prior to injecting the drug mix through it). Then, attach the \u2019primed\u2019 wheel filter to the 3 ml syringe containing the mix, followed by a new 19 g needle tip. Push the mix through the wheel filter into another syringe or into a swabbed clean bowl.\n\nStep four\n\nWash your hands, swab your injection site, attach a 26g needle tip and inject the mix slowly into the vein.\n\nStep five\n\nWash your hands immediately after injecting. Place all the used equipment into a sharps container and dispose of responsibly. \n\nImportant: If there is any pain, inflammation or redness around your injection site seek medical assistance.\n\nWhen you take the needle out of your arm, put pressure on the injection site for a couple of minutes to stop the bleeding. Using a swab will only make it bleed and bruise.\n\nWash your hands and place all used equipment in to the safe disposal bottle and seal. Dispose of the bottle responsibly. \n\n\n\nThis information found at",

        "post_content": "Im not sure if I am posting this in the correct place but I would like to share a small trip report in regards to injecting the NEW generic Suboxone tablets marked with a funny looking half moon or a \"D\" and the numbers 155 on it. NOW I must say that it is IN NO WAY SAFE EVER EVER EVER EVER to inject any kind of pill BUT if you are like my kitty cat \"Whiskers\" you may think you have 9 LIVES and do it anyways. My kitty knows these dangers but is also well aware of the \"less is more\" deal with bupe and due to finacial reasons choses against my protest this particular ROA. Suboxone is also a HORRIBLY addixtive drug and the less the daily dosage she uses the better she feels.\n\nNow when my little whisker paws wants to keep PAWS (haha pun intended) at bay, she uses somewhere around .25 suboxone pill Iv'd each day. She does this with NEW rigs with an alcohol soaked work station and when lil kittys finances permit a wheel filter. This does NOT in any way make it safe just a bit safer in a harm reduction point of view.\n\nSo here is what happened with the new GENERIC SUBOXONE..\n\nT+000 Crush a small piece(apx .5mg) of the new tablet in steril spoon, add 60 units distilled water and mixed with the plunger. (DO NOT COOK) (NEVER EVER COOK YOUR PILLS) Kitty couldn't afford any wheel filters today so she sucked up the disolved solution thru a cutip cotton. Then sqirted the solution into another sterile spoon and refiltered the same way. She then tied off, found an ol faithful vein, swabbed with an alcohol pad, stuck, registered and injected. Kitty DOES NOT re-apply alcohol after the shot as she believes this helps not leave tracks. (kitty traks haha) \n\nAs with Suboxone there was no immediate rush\n\nT+5:00- Kitty does not feel any ill effects, in fact kitty feels more euphoria than she is used to coming on. This makes whiskers WHISKERS rise in surprise.\n\nT+15:00- Kitty is full of euphoria and energy. she is happy and content when before she was in mild kitty withdrawal.\n\nT+60:00 - Kitty is now typing this report and still has a moderate amount of euphoria. Even more than at the 15min interval and it feels (she meowed to me) as the euphoria is still rising...\n\nSo in conclusion as of thus far is that injecting the new Suboxone Generics seemed to work even better for kitty then the previous. They did not gel up or any shady business like that. Its funny because the person that my kitty gets them from said that her Dr told her that this new formulation was designed to keep people from cooking and shooting. She also said that these pills were a combinaton of Subutex and Suboxone. hahahaha well i guess thats true in a sense but so ludacris in so many ways. \n\nI would like to hear other reports about the use of this new Generic Suboxone as I seem to be the first to report the use of them. I'd like to hear reports including all ROA's of this pill and how they compare to the old N8's, the FILMS and Subutex.\nOn a side note I am glad that RB's patten FINALLY ran out allowing the production of Generics since they had a borderline CRIMINAL monopoly on the Bupe market and can NO LONGER price gouge the crap out of people trying to better their lives by losing the chemical handcuffs of Opiate Narcotics including Methadone.\n\nI_MISS_160s added 1 Minutes and 21 Seconds later...\n\nPLEASE PLEASE PLEASE KIDS, KITTYS, AND PUPPIES AND PET TURTLES... IF YOU DO NOT ALREADY IV YOUR DRUGS DO NOT START. IT IS CRAZY DANGEROUS WITH MINIMUL REWard.\n\nI_MISS_160s added 12 Minutes and 6 Seconds later...\n\ni VERY MUCH APOLOGIZE if this is in the wrong spot. Its a trip report and certainly a stance on harm reduction. I am NEW well been a member over a year but VERY new to posting and just don't know how to start new posts. Hopefully I will figure out how to navigate soon as to not upset anyone or annoy anyone. I WILL NOT however EVER use SWIM, You etc",

People believe that the Naloxone in Suboxone will make you magically sick by putting you into precipitated withdrawals. This is 100% NOT TRUE. Naloxone was only put into Suboxone's formulation as a scare tactic to people who might abuse them by shooting them. But, becauue of Bupenorphines (the main ingredient in Suboxone) extremely high binding affinity to the opioid receptors in the brain, it makes it impossible for the Naloxone to even reach them. \n\nThis means that if you have a prior opioid dependency and you have done other full agonist opiate medications/drugs and not waited long enough from dosing them, to dosing your Suboxone OR Subutex, that the Bupenorphine (NOT NALOXONE) will push those other drugs off and bind making you feel usually very bad withdrawal symptoms. \n\nNOW LET ME BE CLEAR.. USING IV AS YOUR ROA FOR SUBOXONE, SUBUTEX, OR ANY PILL IS NOT SAFE AND JUST DOWN RIGHT DANGEROUS. But, people do it every day and I just feel that people should have accurate information about the drugs they use.\n\nI don't think its fair to say people are \"sad\" or \"stupid\" for asking for the safest way to use their Suboxone weather they are going to Shoot, Snort, Take Orally, put it up their Bum, or dribble it in their ears if that happens to be their question.\n\nAs you should probably know this is a HARM REDUCTION forum and a great tool to keep drug users as safe as they can be as they will most likely use the drugs no matter what. So, Lets help keep each-other safe. Well, as safe as we possibly can...\n\nBy the way, I am writing this and able to attest to how using IV Suboxone works becasue my little kitty does it Daily, and the binding affinity of Bupe and, Naloxone being without just cause in the formulation is fact. It can be researched using by UTFSE or searching via Google....\n\nSorry for the use of SOME caps.. Just feel that these were points i really wanted to put some EMPHASIS on .... \n\nHope this helps.\nBe SAFE PEOPLE\nJJ\n__________________________________\nFRIENDS DON'T LET FRIENDS USE \"SWIM\"",

Secondly, even suboxone (with the naloxone in it), wouldn't be of any concern because buprenorphine has a much higher affinity than naloxone. Meaning it will never be active. They put it in as a marketing ploy to get fast tracked FDA approval. Even if you inject suboxone (with the naloxone), it wouldn't be able to compete with the buperenirphine anyway.\n\nThe reason why I think it's a bad idea to bang either of those drugs is because nowadays, suboxone is mainly prescribed in film form now. Those films have emulsifiers in them, and those emulsifiers used in those films are similar to pig fat. I don't know about anything else, but I do know that I wouldn't want any emulsifier in my veins.\n\nThe other reason I caution banging either subutex/suboxone, is for the same reason I tell anyone not to bang pills anyway... the reason is, that those pills have fillers/binders/emulsifiers in them (that even using wheel filters), you will leave trace amounts or larger amounts of those (fillers/binders/emulsifier) behind, risking all sorts of problems.\n\nThat's my option on that,\n\nZadkiel",

And then you need to stop the methadone and wait until you\u2019re pretty damn sick. I don\u2019t know if when the reality of acute withdrawal sets in I wouldn\u2019t change my mind, but it seems worthwhile to just stick out the whole detox process. You could taper down even lower and slower and more comfortably.\n\nIf you\u2019re afraid of relapsing after you\u2019re off methadone, there\u2019s vivitrol, which blocks the high with naltrexone and also - according to my doctor - helps to reduce cravings. Then when you\u2019re ready to come off that, you can simply quit with no withdrawal worries. Just don\u2019t relapse because your receptors will be highly sensitive and overdose is a significant risk.\n\nI\u2019d be reluctant to jump into a monthly Buprenorphine shot without trying the daily sublingual tablet first.

And I\u2019m like wtf is that meanining? Then I realized Benzodiazepine.\n\nI dunno, I\u2019ve already come this far, and my motro is that I gotta give it a try so I can have an actual opinion.

Or go to other provinces. With Subclocade I think that\u2019s possible.\n\nSomeone mentioned that it only lasts 3 weeks then they are in bed sick for a week waiting for the next dose. My prescriber told me it was just every 26 days. So I wont have to wait a week in agony.\n\nSorry, a little tired from a night of hanging with a long time no see friend last night, so my thoughts aren\u2019t the most organized.

I might suggest if you\u2019re going on a long trip to have a few backup Buprenorphine just in case the shot does wear off early for some reason. Can you do that?\n\nI loved the convenience of Suboxone. There\u2019s nothing like just having a month\u2019s supply of the drugs you need and not worrying. Certainly not the same with methadone but not everyone can responds the same way to certain drugs.\n\nDidn\u2019t you go on opiate maintenance for depression initially? Does the Buprenorphine help with that as well as methadone or did you move past your depression in another way?",

I completely understand that you want out of the daily routine of going to the methadone clinic. This will free you from that. Most accounts I\u2019ve heard from people is that it takes a bit of time (a month or so) to get use to the fact that they do not have to take daily meds. It does become a ritual for most anyone, and some miss that perceived or imagined head change from taking that daily dose. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t worry about the shot wearing off either. That first month you should be able to get oral suboxone from your doctor to bridge any gaps from those initial injections if you have any? A lot of people that first get on buprenorphine injections are hesitant because it is a commitment. Some people still want the ability to take less or none at all to still get high if they want to. By them getting monthly injections, they can no longer get high if they want to. Some don\u2019t want to, or aren\u2019t ready to make that kind of commitment. It sounds like you are.\n\nMy problem with those injections is getting off of them. There is plenty of instances of people still testing positive for buprenorphine even though they have been off of the shots and buprenorphine for well over a year to 18 months sometimes. The longer you get the injections, the longer the cumulative amount of buprenorphine will be present. There isn\u2019t a way to taper down from those injections in any real way. You could be thinking your cured from opioid addiction and the pain of withdrawals, only to find out quite a bit after your last final shot, that you are completely fucked (and the doctor has washed his hands of you)! I just think you would have to be resigned to have to keep taking those injections for the rest of your life? How is it even possible to taper from sublocade? Suboxone is already near impossible to taper off of, same with methadone. I am the only person I know irl that has ever gotten completely clean from those long acting MAT opioids (and thankfully all opioids for 8 years now). I did it the hard way too, cold turkey from methadone after years on buprenorphine before that. I hated that I was a slave to those MAT drugs and after getting kicked out of my clinic for smoking pot, I had such a pure hatred for what opioids did to me and what a slave they made me, that I suffered the withdrawals that lasted well over 18 months. I still can\u2019t sleep right and have some serious PTSD from that. So don\u2019t be like me if you don\u2019t have to.\n\nThey are also quite painful to get I hear, where they need to squish up your belly to inject it into your belly fat. \n\nThese are just some things to think about, because it is a commitment to get on those injections, especially coming from methadone. If you think that this will give you peace of mind knowing that you can go away for a month and not have to worry about relapsing or going to a clinic or pharmacy for MAT, than give it a shot (pun intended). \n\nZadkiel",

A situation like that, no anti depressant in the world could make me not depressed over the loss of my Father so tragically unfortunately. So the initial attempt of curing my prior depression, well it was crushed by my loss as you can imagine.\n\n\n--- Double Post Merged, Feb 20, 2022 ---\n\n@Archangel Zadkiel , thanks for the comprehensive message. It was really long, so I'm gonna keep it short, but I'm not sure how they taper off Sublocade as well. But I have a high possibility of Chrons disease or something similar. Diarhea everyday.\n\nUntil they put me on Methadone. After that, I have maybe had Diarhea 4 times in over 8yrs (I think, I stopped counting). So maybe it would be beneficial for me to be on a long term long LONG acting Opiate as it's helped my gastrointestinal tract to be not horrid.",

Regardless if you were addicted to opioids before is inconsequential now.

If they work for you than they work for you.\n\nSorry you had to read my long post before. I was under the false impression that you may want to get off of these drugs some day? You don\u2019t have to want to get off of them either. It\u2019s just that most people like myself hated being forced to be on those \u201cliquid handcuffs\u201d as you put it, and want to know if they\u2019ll ever be able to get off of them? I did!\n\nI didn\u2019t read that thread because I did think it was tolling. I\u2019m guessing that a lot of people here did respond to that thread and probably were confused to why you would want to go to a methadone clinic under false pretenses and not addicted to opioids.\n\nHere\u2019s my opinion, take it for whatever it\u2019s worth. Get the injections for however long you can. If you think you might possibly have Crohn\u2019s disease (they do have simple tests for that btw), than stay on these drugs as long as possible. It truly is a nightmare to get off of them, benzos were a walk in park compared to the level of hell getting off of MAT drugs are (my opinion). These injections make it that much harder to get off.\n\n*edit* for anyone reading this, this is the thread that I never responded to or read because I thought it was a joke at the time.\n\nhttps://drugs-forum.com/threads/starting-methadone-therapy-when-not-addicted-to-opiates.298516/\n\nZadkiel",

Obviously it is an individual decision to taper off any drug you are taking, but perhaps the societal impression of MAT needs to shift and it should really be considered a life time option if people want it to be, and they shouldn\u2019t be shamed over that.",

But after the session she gave me her phone number. We chatted about her experiences. She said the second time, she did 300mg the first 26days, 300mg the next, then dropped to 100mg the next without any noticeable withdrawal effects, then next month she was off it.\n\nIf a single person whom I talk to has done it, I can do it.\n\nAlso, if anyone is worried about me getting high on the side on the MAT\u2019s, that\u2019s a no.

I was taking 3 15mg oxycodone and 2 20mg OxyContin daily, oxycodone for break through relief and OxyContin every 12 hours.\n\nAs the years went on, the more opiates I would take and the misuse began to get out of control. It started to really affect my family and work life. After a month or so of taking Suboxone, I could really tell everything was now on even keel. However, the dosage of suboxone I was prescribed really wasn\u2019t any help with the chronic pain. Now here I am 9 months later still on suboxone and still dealing with the pain. \n\nI know I made the right choice to get off the narcotic opiates but sometimes I\u2019m kicking myself for that decision when the pain is really bad. At this point my doc is probably extremely hesitant to re-prescribe the oxy and I feel that is no longer an option for me. I would like to speak with him about possibly trying Methadone for the chronic pain next month. \n\nI was looking for anyone that has had experience with using both suboxone and methadone for chronic pain. When I say both, I\u2019m not meaning both meds at the same time, I\u2019m talking one versus the other and opinions/experiences others have had. I know that the dosing of methadone is a little tricky and that if i was to be prescribed, it would most likely be a low dose to start before titration to a higher dose that would probably be more suitable for my pain. That in itself is going to be a bit of a struggle from month to month until I finally get a higher dose. So please, if you have had experiences, good or bad, with using suboxone and methadone for chronic pain, I would love to hear from you.",

There are apparently diminishing returns in terms of pain management on higher levels of Suboxone.\n\nI\u2019ve been on Suboxone and methadone separately, but for addiction. I have some normal aches and pains though that I noticed when I stopped taking heroin daily. It\u2019s a fantastic pain reliever. When I went on Suboxone I was always much more achy everywhere for a long period of time. I never actually made it longer than a month without relapsing back to H, despite a dose of 16 to 24 mg daily. It felt like I had arthritis in my fingers and my lower back always hurt.\n\nOn methadone - my dose is 160 mg - I feel physically much more like I did on heroin, except I don\u2019t have to keep dosing every 3-4 hours. I only get aches late at night and in the morning when my dose starts to wear off. It\u2019s a very marked change in ache/pain level between when I awake feeling like I got squeezed in a vice - all my muscles tense and sore - and when my dose start to kick in about an hour later. Most of the aches are usually gone within an hour and they totally gone within 3 hours, up until around 6 pm. I still feel good until around 2am and wake up with aches at 3 am every day like I have an internal alarm that goes off. Despite the early morning dose wearing off, methadone feels a million times better suboxone, as far as minor aches and pains.\n\nI know your situation is different, but hopefully I gave you some useful information.\nGood luck with your doctors and getting some relief. What kind of pain do you have? Some type pains can be treated with non-Opiate drugs like gabapentin.",

        "post_content": "Thanks for sharing your experiences BirdJungle. I\u2019m with you on the low dose of buprenorphine, I was prescribed Belbuca for about 4 months, starting at 75 mcg. then 150 mcg to 300, skipped 450 and tried 600mcg for the last RX. It didn\u2019t work for me at all. I felt absolutely zero relief, it was a tough 4 months. Belbuca is a small minty square you slightly wet with saliva and then stick to the inside of cheek until it dissolves.\n\nI think I\u2019m going to ask doc about me trying methadone and ween off suboxone. 1). It\u2019s not working so well for my pain and I take 2 8mg films a day. 2). The films taste horrible and I can never get it to go away. 3). My doctors PA was talking about reducing my dose to 3 - 4mg films a day, which not only would it help me since 16 mg per day doesn\u2019t provide relief but that\u2019s just one more nasty tasting film I have to deal with.\n\nIf I were to get switched to methadone, I know that they will start me on the lowest dose and I also know that that dose will not help and it\u2019s going to take months of increasing in order for me to get the proper dose and relief. That\u2019s even if it were to work for me at all. \n\nI\u2019m just really tired of being in pain which makes me kick myself for getting off oxy. But I knew that it was probably the best choice, not only for me but for my family and employer. I mean suboxone isn\u2019t helping now and if they do decrease my dose it really will not help, so trying methadone might be worth trying. My doc and I have a good relationship, I\u2019m completely honest with him so he had a trust in me. Asking for methadone should not be an issue. \n\nAgain, thanks for the info, I\u2019m looking forward to hear some other people\u2019s experience with it (methadone)\n\n\n--- Double Post Merged, Oct 4, 2021 ---\n\nAlso, what mg of buprenorphine is equal to mg of methadone? I know that methadone dosing is a bit different than regular opiate dosing on the morphine comparable chart table.",

I was thinking how could that possibly work in such low doses when some people are prescribed suboxone for pain, which is buprenorphine and naloxone (usually 8/2 or 4/1 mg doses). There is such I big difference in the dosing of the medicine. I don\u2019t believe the naloxone plays a part in the pain management department of it. Is it that low doses of buprenorphine works better for pain management? Is it the old saying \u201cless is more\u201d type thing?\n\nI do plan on talking with doc about trying methadone for pain management in hopes that he will agree and that I get dosed a bit higher than the recommended starting low dose.\n\nI\u2019ve been a member here since 2018, but I guess I haven\u2019t yet met the guidelines to change my \u201cnewbie\u201d status, lol.",

        "post_content": "Pharmacology geek/ actually studied in school but far more so via official sources (not Wikipedia lol), with sometimes severe as shit chronic groin pain, who's had extensive experience with every opiate beside Oxymorphone over 10ish years (regarding opiates specifically; with some periods off of them, like 9 months almost entirely at one point).\n\nThat's exactly my/ nearly everyone's experience with oxycodone, if they're being honest/ non-drug seeking of course lol. It's just too much ups and downs and inclination for even the utmost normal human beings with 0 predilections for addiction, it's entirely normal to enjoy the feeling of drugs mimicking/ using endorphins base as a key and foundation for even interacting with the brain/body. People who don't see anything to enjoy are absolutely outliers.\n\nBut more now to your question specifically. I've taken up to 32mg of Suboxone, and when you're getting up there in dose, things start to work a bit better for pain relief (for people such as yourself with a tolerance to opiates, those small (and old school. it's been around long before suboxone ones; those 600mcg and under dosages) doses don't tend to work so well. Though it's wonderfully refreshing to hear someone really making an effort to exhaust all possibilities and do things slowly, even while in pain. \n\nI understand the potential feeling of haste after being in pain so long. If you've only messed with Suboxone at dosages below 24mg, especially with how patient and hard you've seemed to have worked to avoid overdoing the more intense choice (Methadone is, objectively), I'd strongly recommend getting up to at least that sorta of 24-36mg range for Suboxone (if you even need to get that high up; you'll see as you get there if you haven't already) before stepping into the Methadone arena. I tried Suboxone for 2-2.5 years before I just couldn't keep suffering the way I was.\n\nMethadone is a kickass pain killer. Arguably the best single one for sustained pain, period lol; but you're signing a contract of a sort. You're making a commitment to dependency on a medication (not largely different than taking an anti-depressant; less potentially lethal, in regards to trying to cease treatment, in fact), which shouldn't be taken lightly; but you've likely figured this out to an extent already. Me? I went on it entirely okay with never coming off of it/ doing what feels right and results in the best overall improvement in my quality of life. It's going to be horrid to come off if I ever do. \n\nI have anxiety about something happening and disabling my access to Methadone for whatever reason (not from doctors; not something you need to worry about here when you're in documented chronic pain. Just random emergencies or bullshit happening and then what, I'm just cold turkey from a 185mg dose? I've kicked opiates more than 20 times [done so twice in 8 days even. My brain registers the withdrawals as a symptom of poising; the poisin being the opiate that's absence is throwing my body into sheer chaos).\n\nSo I've wrestled with my mind/ with whether I want or need to be leaning on opiates as a crutch for half my life almost... extremely sadly.... Finally, personally, settling on Methadone being the best choice, even though I know it's one of the hardest things to turn back from after a period of time especially. There's no more rollercoaster. There is relief, which I'm still working on fully achieving, using combinations of other techniques also to manage my pain and other conditions as well; namely Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Lidocaine- Ketamine infusions. Mindfulness training is also KEY. To life in general, but if you're not into it for the opening you're mind and soul part.... You sure as shit will be for the relief/ peace it can aid in giving you which no medication can really beat; not in conjunction with one-another especially. \n\nA bit off topic, I know, but I strongly urge all pain patients to do much more than take medications; often times, we're taking more than we need because we have limited strategies with which to cope/ manage. But above are a few that I know, sure as we'll all one day die, work wonders to varying degrees for varying people; but they work.\n\nSo go up in suboxone first. If you haven't even neared reaching the ceiling of the drug Buprenorphine [the partial agonist that's working for you in Suboxone aka the active drugs name; yes there's also naloxone, but it's anti-abuse and not active taken normally] (which is about 36mg, depending slightly on the person but not massively), I strongly recommend not taking the potentially unneeded and hard to take back leap into Methadone based treatment. BUT, if you do exhaust Suboxone's abilities and don't find sufficient relief, you will find it in Methadone. Just be open and honest with yourself foremost!!!!\n\nBest of luck,\nJoel",

        "post_content": "I can share my experience.\n\nI took buprenorphine for years. During that time I had several bouts of acute pain \u2014 I don\u2019t suffer from chronic pain thankfully, so I\u2019m hoping you can use my experience with acute pain as that is the only way I can relate.\n\nThe buprenorphine was of no use, even when I increased my dose up to 32 mg. Furthermore, because the drug is pretty effective at blocking opiate receptors, I couldn\u2019t even get pain relief from other opioids, in my case hydromorphone. It was a nightmare.\n\nI was so freaked out with these pain experiences that I went off my bupe and relapsed on heroin. After that time, plus a few more relapses, I gave into the fact that the medication just wasn\u2019t working for me, and I went back to methadone, which I had been on years ago and I knew worked well to treat my addiction.\n\nThe dose of methadone for pain and the dose for addiction are hugely different. You were on 85 mg of oxycodone total, and the equivalent dose of methadone would be around 21 mg per day. For pain patients, from what I\u2019ve seen, that\u2019s a pretty good dose, but for addiction it\u2019s quite small. Most methadone clinics give you a starting dose of 30 mg, and doses can reach over 100 mg. If you want to take that much methadone you\u2019ll probably have to get it from a clinic which means going there every day at first. \n\nAlso, methadone\u2019s analgesic activity is shorter than it\u2019s anti-addiction activity so when used for pain the dose is usually broken up into two or three doses per day, whereas for addiction you usually just get one dose a day. \n\nBased on your history I\u2019m not clear if you want to approach the methadone from a pain medication perspective or from an addiction medication perspective but, as I\u2019ve tried to outline here, the two treatment modalities are quite different. I think this is unfortunate. From what I\u2019ve seen a lot of pain patients also struggle with addiction. There is so much black and white thinking where the reality is very gray. But something you should reflect on, because you may have to make the choice between using the medication for addiction or for pain.",

        "post_content": "Hello!\nI am a long time IV drug user who has, over time, done significant damage to my body. I started my addiction with no concern to my health and ended it with a desire to be healthy, use drugs on my terms and not the other way round, and ultimately to live! \n\nI got off heroin and got on suboxone. Soon after I made the unfortuate decision to begin IV'ing my suboxone, which shifted to IV'ing subutex, and eventually I came to realize I could not support this way of life. \n\nBut I couldn't stop...\nI was feeling unhealthy, lethargic, and (physically/mentally) numb. Literally, the damage to my cardiovascular system was making my extremities go numb. \nMy veins were dying off and I was in deep trouble. I couldn't seem to switch back to sublingual usage and IV use was not an option. I was stuck.\n\nIM INJECTING SUBUTEX\nThis is the method my girlfriend and I use to IM inject our subutex. This method requires the use of a micron filter (wheel filter). There are many types of wheel filters, the type I use is: .22um pore size, PES membrane. The syringes I use are 3ml, 25gauge, 1in. tip with luer lock needles. Luer lock needles are needles that can be removed from the barrel of the syringe and a wheel filter can be attached in its place.\n\nPlace your desired amount of subutex in a spoon*\nAdd however much water you feel comfortable using. Mix solution thoroughly**\nDraw the solution up through a tight piece of cotton fiber\nRemove the needle from the syringe and screw on the wheel filter\nClean the spoon before carefully pushing the solution through the filter onto the spoon\nDraw the solution up through another piece of tightly wrapped cotton\nThe resulting soltution is ready to be injected into a muscle.\n\nEXPLANATION\nSo this method probably isn't for everyone. It certainly isn't 'healthy' or 'safe'. It is, however, a good middle ground between sublingual and IV. Some people will say that doing this is akin to switching seats on the titanic. I wont argue that, but I will say that it is more specifically switching seats from the sinking tail of the ship to its nose. Your mindset may be slowly transitioning to one of a healthier lifestyle but your body might not have time to survive you thinking it through. Give your veins a rest and while your at it break a habit. I not only now understand the damage IV injecting drugs was causing, but I'm doing something about it. I no longer IV any drugs.\n\n*My subutex are the orange, oval 8mg pills that are not scored. This makes dosing, regardless of ROA, difficult. I weighed my pill on a scale and it came to roughly 4g. This means 1/4 a pill, or 2mg, is 1g. \n**I have found that .1-.3ml changes in water volume have little/no effect on muscle degradation. My subutex have a lot of filler so generally ~.4ml water is enough to dissolve 2-3mg. Your type of subutex might dissolve an entire 8mg in .4ml water. Just remember that it is not unusal to lose ~.1ml solution while using the micron filter.\n\nI want to repeat that this method is not a healthy alternative and it is 100 times better to take the medication as prescribed. It takes roughly 3-4 minutes for the subutex to kick in and your muscles will be sore at the beginning of their use for injection, much like an IV injection will bruise at first.\n\nLet me know what you think so I can get some feedback. After using drugs recklessly for a long time and not dying, one comes to realize that the damage one is doing to the body is not worth the reward. Better yet, its not sustainable. \n\nAnybody else administer subutex this way? General thoughts?\nBe safe!",

I think a part of what's hard about getting clean is that drug users typically don't go right into IV heroin use, they take steps towards that endgoal slowly and over time.\n\nMany people take a longer path to drug absitanence than others, moving from IV heroin use to sublingual subutex and then back to IV subutex. Many people don't learn good harm reduction techniques and when the time comes they want to change their way of life, substantial damage has been irreperably done. It happens and it happens a lot, leading people like myself to get stuck in a habitually destructive loop. Switching back to sublingual use for me was reminiscent of being dope sick. Evewhen I took higher doses to combat those feelings I would still feel crappy. I cant afford to feel crappy while at my job working and switching to a safe, IM route has really helped me.\n\nAgain, to be clear: This thread was made for a specific demographic of user: long term IV heroin users prescribed subutex who began IVing their doses and cannot stop.",

I dont want to lose my last good one. I guess I can hit my hand veins easily but I'd rather not go down that path. Anyway, a couple times I have missed and essentially skin popped. Still worked more or less. I always use 22 filters and 31g pins. So I am wondering about SC/IM for properly filtered bupe solution?

I prefer dosing twice however...a little in the a.m. and the rest after sunset.\nHonestly the reason I stopped sublingual use was because it was making my gums recede (otherwise good dental health) and sometimes I would get headaches. I never get headaches with IV bupe, I feel much better with this ROA, other than the pain/time/effort of registering.

I only took it sublingual as prescribed. I think my pills were a little smaller though! If I\u2019m remembering correctly one 8 mg sublingual tablet was only 30 mg by weight. I could totally be remembering wrong, but 4 mg sounds really large.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019ve only heard of people sniffing it successfully, not injecting either IV or IM or subcutaneous. Especially with Suboxone, I would be concerned about the naloxone in there and the potential for it to trigger precipitated withdrawal. It\u2019s in there to keep people from injecting the drug.\n\nSince it\u2019s about a year later it would be good to know how things turned out for the OP. You don\u2019t feel the Buprenorphine when you inject it do you? \n\nSo I know injection can be a process addiction in itself. Maybe it would be best to inject something inert to get your process fix until you can wean yourself off that habit? Just a thought. I\u2019ve never been addicted to injecting because I\u2019ve sniffed my heroin 99 percent of the time and injecting is still quite scary to me.\n\nBut if Buprenorphine isn\u2019t working for you as prescribed, maybe try something else? I tried going on Buprenorphine for over a year and it always made me feel terrible, just like @mylifeismiserable described when going back to sublingual use ... feeling crappy, like you\u2019re dope sick. But I also got crazy depressed after that dope sick feeling subsided. So I finally got on methadone and it is completely different. I don\u2019t even want heroin and I didn\u2019t think that was possible. I even bought some, certain that I needed it as a backup and I thought I wanted to get high on it and skip some methadone doses like I used to skip my Suboxone. But I don\u2019t even want it. It\u2019s surprising to me to feel like that.\n\nI don\u2019t know. Maybe if you feel like you need to inject Buprenorphine, you\u2019re either not really ready to give up dope or you should try a different maintenance medication? Or perhaps use something safer to inject when you feel the need to use a needle.",

I\u2019ve heard of people with no or little opiate tolerance using it on occasion to get high, but not daily.

Does the wheel filter take out all the fillers and additives? If you have Suboxone, I don\u2019t think the filter would remove the naloxone, would it?",

        "post_content": "Hey guys, thanks for @Ing me @BirdJungle. You're absolutely correct in assuming I inject for maintenance purposes. I also wanted to clarify that this guide is for Subutex only, not Suboxone. I live in the US and a while back I was sent down to Florida to do what eventually became the rehab circuit and many of the people I met along the way would IV Suboxone. I myself had began IVing it prior to my departure to Florida.\n\nThe issue that this guide was offering resolution too was - many IV drug users, by the time they reach the point they want to call it quits with the needle entirely, are in rough cardiovascular shape. Addiction is a tricky bitch that can grab hold of many people in a variety of intensities. Some people just cant make the jump from one ROA transition to another at the opposite end of the spectrum easily. I personally was running out of time and options; my veins were shot to fucking hell. It wasn't hard at all to switch from IV to IM.\n\nSo, here's a summary of my experience since it has been a year from the date of the OP: Off the top I'd like to say that neither my girlfriend (she does it too) or I have yet to develop an abscess. That implies this guide works fairly well at ridding the injected solution of bacteria, however because of the fact that this is a only a two person experiment there isn't enough data to confidently declare that it works. Luck always plays a factor and that could exactly be it. We also don't experience the muscle soreness that @bigFishSWAMMIN described from rare/occasional IM use. An unexpected but extremely useful perk of this method is the precise dosing. We weighed an 8mg subutex to find that is was close enough to say 4g, meaning that each 1g was 2mg. Buprenorphine users can be prone to not following a steady, repeated dosing regiment. This ROA provided a way to get an exact idea of what dosages you average. Speaking of dosages, the dosages themselves are fractions of what one would normally take with sublingual use. Finally, the perk that satisfies the original intention of this ROA change, my veins are the healthiest they've been in years. Veins I didn't ever expect to resurface did. I want to be clear that this obviously would also be true for if I just switched to sublingual in the first place.\n\nThat was all the good things, now for the negatives: As far as not just switching back to sublingual goes, it is without a doubt that I did not break the addiction to injecting. While overall I feel my attitude towards injecting has changed for the better, I am still injecting and that in itself is a problem in need of solving. That was to be expected. In the beginning our muscle tissues were clean and very capable of withstanding the trauma of a needle puncture as well as anywhere from 50 units (or .5ml, .5cc) to 100 units, as well as metabolize the drug. Over time the muscle begins to toughen and can become difficult to push the needle in and even more so for the solution. My girlfriend and I theorize that this also leads to a stunted absorption of the drug as well. I believe that this problem can be rectified due to the plasticity of muscles by weight lifting but I do not know this to be a fact. Going back to the talk of infections, while it is true neither of us have experienced an abscess, I once injected a shot run through a used micron filter and soon after I began to experience the exact same symptoms of cotton fever. Cotton fever is really just a euphemism for \"dirty hit\". It lasted for about 2 hours and then I was fine. My girlfriend also has one time injected a shot that she said was maybe in a funny spot, referring to either outside the ideal area of injection for that specific muscle or not deep enough and either entirely or partially into the fat layer. She experienced what looked to be the beginning of an abscess that luckily was cured with only a hot compress and frequent rubbing. This surely could have developed into an abscess that required antibiotics and a lancing, proper technique is of the utmost importance! Finally, this year has been very labor intensive and stressful at times.\n\nI'll finish by just saying @BirdJungle that for injecting suboxone that the strips should never be messed with and that in actuality its not the naloxone that causes precipitated w/d's. The Buprenorphine, being a partial agonist/antagonist, takes the receptor over the naloxone and its the antagonist properties of the bupe that put the user into the w/d's. I've heard a doctor once tell me that the naloxone isn't even very bioavailable sublingually but don't take that as fact. Also I do occasionally still feel the bupe if but only for a few seconds. That depends on the previous days dosage and the time between injections. And yes, partially do to me using this guide and quitting IV use, my life is much less miserable. These days I'm fairly happy.",

However, the naloxone is added to deter injecting because it\u2019s supposed to be bio available in that small quantity via injection, but not sublingual. So the rationale is that even if you have no other opiate in your system and you inject Suboxone or any Buprenorphine formulation with naloxone, you\u2019ll get precipitated withdrawal as a result, instead of a high. It\u2019s debatable that it always works that way though, from what I\u2019ve read. Some people have horrible experiences; some no problem. \n\nBut yeah, I know from experience unfortunately that Buprenorphine alone causes precipitated withdrawal if you even have a tiny hint of opiate in your system. \n\nGood to know you\u2019re still doing ok. Do you have any plans or desire to come off the Buprenorphine or try to stop injecting? Just curious. I don\u2019t have any advice in that regard.",

Well, she's no pro and she missed a majority of the shot...it was deep inside her arm so she didn't notice any missing until her arm started to \"blow up\" a bit so should I say.. It was half of a syringe of fluid, and it slightly burned while she was shooting it. Not being a pro, she was unsure if that's just the way it was supposed to feel..\n\nAnyway, the next day she got in a physical fight with a really mean girl and her arm swollen up double in size and was red. She thought that was due to the physical altercation, but as a few days went by the swelling went down and left a quarter size in diameter, hard lump. Red hot to the touch, a lot of pressure, and most certainly an abscess from previous missed shot... This knot on her arm is raised about a quarter of an inch and now slightly larger than a quarter. Red and hot to the touch. Knowing now that its an abscess from her missed shot, she had been putting tea tree oil on it (to work as an antibacterial) and vitamin e oil on it every day, alternating between tea tree oil and vitamin e oil.\n\nIts been about 5-6 days now and the abscess has no head, but is very tight, red, hot, and shiny on the skin. \nThis morning g she woke up with puss all over her shirt (shes been wearing long sleeve shirts to hide it). Its an off-white color puss. She took off the shirt and the access still has no head, but there's a thin layer of skin that's been slid off the top (probably rubbed off in her sleep) and is slowly draining puss through the pores of this opened skin. She cleaned it well with soapy hot water on a washcloth, poured rubbing alcohol on it, rubbed some of that slimy vitamin e oil on it, and put gauze pad over it... \nThis girl used to have a drug problem, and no longer does.. If her boyfriend knew she used a needle an got an abscess, he would kick her out of the house and she has no friends to stay with and she has no family.. \n\nShe says hospital is not an option, because her boyfriend would find out (they are very close and would be suspicious if she did not tell him why she was in hospital and know its for drugs). She has heard of people draining their own abscesses successfully and she says that is her only option.. She is asking me to ask on this forum, for anyone who has successfully drained their own abscess, and wants to know how to do it because she's going to do it herself regardless of what anyone tells her.\n\nI just want her to be safe, and I want to know if anyone here has done it, or is a medical professional, to tell me how to safely drain an abscess of this size at home so I can tell her how to do it safely. A And if its a possibility on this page, I can post a picture of her abscess for you guys to help. Please help, this is a very serious situation... Thank you so much in advance. \nNamaste",

I was thinking to just tell her to keep disinfecting and bandaging it as she has, and tomorrow I will take her first thing in the morning to the hospital because she has no other options... She seems dead set on doing it herself because she's heard of people just slitting it with exacto knife, draining it, and it was fine.. She seems to think people do this all the time.. Which is why I signed up on this site to ask the question and get some feedback..\n\nI know I always get good feedback reading these forums so I figured this was the best place to go.. I'm afraid I won't be able to convince her to go... Anyone have any ideas of stories for other reasons as to how an abscess could have happened on her arm? Something she can tell her boyfriend if I hopefully convince her to go?\n\nOr if not, anyone have any ideas what to look out for as bad signs of infection if she doesn't heed my (all of your) advice and does it herself anyway?? I jut want to convince her to go and have a good story for her boyfriend, and if I still can't convince her and she does it on her own, what signs to look for as bad infection or something? I'm just so worried, and if shed get kicked out I'd feel so bad for her, I live with my parents, they wouldn't allow her to stay here (I sleep on their couch, its already crowded enough). I just want to co.e up with a goof excuse to get her in there",

But i found plenty of how to guides by google. From what i understand its best to wait til it softens and a head appears to lance the abscess\n\nThings to watch out for are more pain, fever, and just feeling sick. All those are reasons she should see a dr asap.\n\nLike i said please have her look for natural alternatives to antibiotics. Although theres no promises. But its better to try her hardest then do nothing. \n\nI wish you and her luck. \n\nPlease update. \nPeace",

They are usually called boils and they are much smaller than that--but she could tell the BF that she cut herself there or got a cat scratch or something, and for some reason, it got majorly infected.\n\nI have personally lanced much smaller abscesses--like one in my mouth when I was in the Australian Outback in the middle of nowhere--and it has worked out okay, but these were indeed much smaller. I have never tackled anything that large. Also, if it IS MRSA, lancing it is likely to cause it to spread, not shrink. I still think the ER is your best bet. As Perro said, they are obligated to treat you whether you have insurance or not. Just think--your life or arm could be in danger. Is that worth messing around with? I think not.\n\nGood luck and do the logical thing today.",

If you act or treat it like it's something you have to hide or is from drugs your causing all this suspicion around it that's not needed. \n\nAs other have stated MRSA is for the most part very well known and would you try to hide it if it was something that just appeared and you weren't injecting?
