# test.ipynb, submissions.ipynb

These two files used the reddit data, test used the comments and submissions used the posts, and found the sentiment of all the posts. Both have attempts at other analysis, but they were ultimately not used. 

# all_data.ipynb

This file used the data from both of the above files, and were used to find the top posters and commenters to decide who was a significant user. We eventually reached three users, and finalized their data and removed all the useless data in the dataframe. That data is stored in 'final_users.json'

# final_analysis.ipynb

This file was the final analysis that was uploaded into the fron end. The extra pngs in this folder come from this file and are the saved copies of the one in this.
