I've been doing the heroin more lately. I'm ready to quit and get off this shit, but I know I won't be able to handle the withdrawals. \\n\\nI've heard of a Three-day suboxone detox being a good method for detoxing without having to face withdrawal symptoms. I don't know much about it though. Is it really that simple? If I go into a suboxone treatment center and tell them how much I'm taking, they'll just be able to put me on suboxone for three days, and then take me off of it, and I won't have to face any withdrawal symptoms when its over? Is that how it works? \\n\\nAny input is appreciated, thanks!\n",

I'd never done it before, but I tried using a suppository to loosen my shit up.\\n\\nIt worked great and I pretty much had a waterfall afterwards, constipation totally relieved. But ever since then, I've been having diarrhea every single day, despite smoking dope. I've even tried smoking more dope than usual and taking imodium but nothing seems to work. I'm still having intense diarrhea and vomiting as well (but I think that's a side effect of the dope).\\n\\nI'm gonna try buying some Peptobismol next to see if that helps. I'm worried I might have some sort of stomach virus but I can risk going to the doctor and mentioning to them that I've been doing dope, so idk what to do.\\n\\nAny advice or insight is appreciated.

I would do them just once or a couple times a week because they were impossible to come by. But one day, I found a solid supply of 10/325 oxys. I experimented with them and at some point, I found my perfect dose. It was 30mg oxy potentiated with 800mg cimetidine (makes it stronger). It was heavenly. It felt like someone had pulled a warm blanket over me and then I'd just nod off and have vivid day dreams. \\n\\nMy tolerance eventually grew extremely quick with the oxy. I could 10 of the 10mg pills at once and that would *just* be enough to give me a warm buzz. After my oxy ran out, I decided to switch over to smoking #3 heroin. \\n\\nI've been doing it for several weeks now, on and off, and no matter how much I smoke, I have not ever gotten that warm blanket feeling I used to get with oxy and other opiates. \\n\\nNowadays when I smoke, all it does it makes me really drowsy, and I nod out. That's still pleasant for me, which is why I keep using, but I really miss the warm blsnket feeling and the euphoria. Those were the best part.\\n\\nI guess it could be a tolerance thing, but my tolerance really isn't *that* high. I've only been smoking ~0.5g a day of mediocre dope. \\n\\nHas this happened to anyone else? Is there anything I can do to fix it?\n",

But where do I get citric acid? Can I just squeeze some lemon juice into there and be set?\\n\\nAlso, I've recently moved to the UK and I have no idea about how the needle exchange programs here work. I've been doing some research but I haven't found anything too useful. Could any UK members please advice me on where to obtain needles suitable for IV'ing dope? Can I just pick them up at a local Boots, or are there actually needle exchanges that will hand them out to me for free? \\n\\nAny input/advice is appreciated. Feel free to PM me.\n",

I've run out of dope and am not ready to through withdrawals. The only thing I can get my hands on right now are 30mg dihydrocodeine tablets. I've read [this bioavailibility chart] and it turns out that the oral bioavailibility of dihydrocodeine is only 20%. Whereas, the intraveneous bioavailibility for it is 100%. \\n\\nI want to get the most that I can out of these, so the only logical solution is to IV them. \\n\\nI've never IV'd before, so I'd like some advice on how I should go about this. I assume the first step is to crush up all 5 tablets, and then dissolve them in some water. My following questions are:\\n\\nWhat kind of needle should I use?\\n\\nHow much water should I use to dilute the 5 pills?\\n\\nIm located in the UK. Is there anywhere where I can legally purchase these needles?\\n\\nAny input/advice is greatly appreciated.\n",

To my understanding, #3 heroin is just diacetylmorphine base, and #4 heroin is the base converted to the HCl salt. So to convert my #3 heroin to #4 heroin, I would just need to add hydrochloric acid to it.\\n\\nWhere do I go about getting some hydrochloric acid? I've heard it can it be found in household cooking supplies? Also, how much acid would I add to how much heroin, and how would I then turn it back into powder so I could snort it? \\n\n",
       "5677      I recently decreased my tolerance because my plug had been dry for about two weeks. Before that, I'd been copping eights weekly, on and off, and smoking through them in usually 5 days. \\n\\nWhile he was dry, I wasn't sure if I'd have to go through withdrawals, so to play it safe I started taking really high doses of codeine daily. I would do a cold water extraction on literally 80 fucking pills (8mg codeine/500mg paracetamol per tablet), and then take about 600mg of codeine. I'd rarely feel high but I guess it helped with not having to experience withdrawal symptoms.\\n\\nHe finally hit me up again last week, and I started off by copping an eighth as usual. I blew through that shit in just one weekend. I'd be high throughout the entire day, nod off for a few hours, and then be unable to sleep at night because of the cozy opiate-induced naps I had taken  earlier. Then throughout the night, I'd think to myself, \"okay, just one more hit before I lie down so I can fall asleep easier\", but it was never enough. I'd end up staying awake until sunrise just taking hit after hit, trying to get high enough to fall asleep. I don't know what it is, but ever since I started doing dope (I switched over from Oxy), I don't get that \"warm blanket\" feeling anymore. Dope just makes me drowsy. I still like it, but it's not the same. \\n\\nAnyway, after blowing through that eighth over the weekend, I re-upped on Tuesday with a quarter ounce. It cost me a ton of money but I figured it should last me a while so it was worth it. But lo and behold, after weighing what I had left last night after using for just two days, I realized that I had gone through over 6 fucking grams. This shit has gotten out of hand.\\n\\nI thought shit was out of hand when I was popping 10 Perc 10/325s every morning, too lazy to even do a CWE. But now I'm smoking through 6g of dope in two days. I can't tell if I'm doing better or worse. \n",

Sure enough, he came back with the dope in less than 1min and then gave me two free Xanax bars just to be nice.\n",

I've just been smoking all day. I've definitely been somewhat high, but I didn't nod at all like I had expected to. \\n\\n\\nIs it possible that this was just some really shitty #3 heroin, [here's a pic for reference](https://i.redd.it/w04y4bd9lmh21.jpg), (it originally came in a big 3.0g rock), or has my tolerance actually just risen *that* fast?\n",

The first two days I had terrible cold sweats and restlessness. The third day, I honestly felt pretty okay. Not many symptoms at all. But when I tried to sleep, after taking 4mg Xanax (I don’t have a tolerance), I only got about 4hrs. Waking up today, it seems the cold sweats are back. I woke up with my bed drenched and my bowels have finally moved. I’d been constipated for the first few days and didn’t understand why, but today I woke up and had diarrhea.  \\n\\nI binged on 60-100mg oxy and then switched to heroin for a period of about 1.5 months. Then I quit cold turkey last Wednesday. \\n\\nI am desperate for a high right now and I want to know, if I took a high dose of codeine right now,  would that just reset my withdrawals? Would I be back at square 1 right after I took it, facing the same symptoms I had the first few days, and then having to endure the full 7-10 day withdrawal all over again? \n",

I was doing 60-100mg Oxy everyday for about three weeks, and once I ran out, I switched over to smoking heroin. I smoked 0.2-0.5g everyday for a few weeks. In total, I went through about 8g. \\n\\nThe only reason I stopped was because my plug was dry. That was 3 days ago. The first night and the second day I had terrible cold sweats and body aches. Today, the third day, I honestly feel okay. The cold sweats have gotten a little better. I've been using Xanax and Lyrica daily and I suppose that's helped.\\n\\nI'm confused though, because I'm still very constipated. I thought I'd be shitting my guts out and needing to take Imodium. Is this normal at all? Is the diarrhea going to come later?\\n\\nAlso, how long will it take for my tolerance to become low enough so that I can get high on codeine? That's all I've got access to right now. \n",

Once I ran out, I switched to smoking heroin. I have now been smoking daily. Initially, I was smoking 0.3g over the course of a day or so. However, one week ago, I bought 3.5g, and today, I am cleaning out the last of that bag. So I've been doing probably 0.5g every day.\\n\\nHow bad is withdrawal gonna be for me? What kind of symptoms can I expect and how long will they last? Also, if I can get my hands on some methadone would that be worth it? (I've heard methadone is ever rougher to withdraw from than heroin).\n",

I've had some success with smoking, but I worry I'm losing some of the product in the process.\\n\\nWould it be possible to instead plug it? Could I just dissolve the #3 heroin into some water, put it into an oral syringe, and boof it? Would that be more effective?\\n\\nAlternatively, would it be possible to turn the #3 heroin into a snortable form? If so, how would I go about doing that?\\n\\nThanks!\n",

For whatever reason, I was really terrible at it and just ended up either burning the dope or letting all the vapor escape before I got to suck it in through my tooter. \\n\\nI remembered reading that it's much easier and more efficient to smoke #3 dope from a meth pipe than it is off foil. So I went out and got a little pipe. Don't know how much I smoked, but it was a great success. \\n\\nAfter a 3 week binge of doing 10/325 oxys every night, I had developed a huge tolerance and taking 10 of them at once (RIP my liver) would only give me a buzz. Eventually, I ran out and decided it was time to try heroin. It was only a matter of time before I did, so I said fuck it.\\n\\nI've never felt euphoria or a \"rush\" from taking pills (orally/intranasally). I've tried codeine, tramadol, vicodin, percocet, morphine, tussionex, and dilaudid, but to no avail. Of course, they made me feel really good, and that's why I kept doing them, but they never gave me the famous rush and euphoria that everyone hear talks about. \\n\\nI thought heroin would, but still, nope. I guess I feel euphoric but I think I'm just happy I finally managed to smoke it properly. Regardless, I feel great. My back and neck pain are gone and my anxiety has melted away. I was so tired of having to crush up 10 fucking pills and then down them all at the same time just for a 30min long buzz.\\n\\nI copped a gram and I'm gonna do my best to ration it and try not to develop a habit. Please spare me the warnings, I'm well aware of how dark this path can be, and I've read all the horror stories about how people have lost everything to this drug. But for now, I'm just enjoying the high and living in the moment. Thanks for reading :)\n",

My skull is thicker than a textbook. I've already started).\\n\\nHowever, my smoking skills really suck. I bought 0.3g and basically wasted all of it trying to smoke it off aluminum-foil. I know it takes practice but I can't afford to keep losing money learning how to chase the dragon properly. \\n\\nSince the dope is actually being vaporized off the foil, does that mean I could put it into a vaporizer and smoke it that way? I've seen posts on here about people using their vapes to smoke heroin, but I believe that was for black tar, which I don't have. I have a tan powder, comes with little rocks. From what I understand it's #3 heroin. \n",

I had to take at least 90mg to actually get high. But now, I'm out. I've never gone through withdrawals before. Is it likely that I'll experience significant symptoms from quitting after 2.5 weeks of use?\\n\\nI can get my hands on codeine but thats about it. Could I use that to taper, or would it just prolong my withdrawals (if I have them)? \n",

Sorry for the long read, writing in detail helps me feel better. \\n\\nSo, a couple weeks back, I binged through\\n- 100 10/650mg Hydrocodone (did CWEs most of the time)\\n\\n*I was doing 60-80mg daily until I ran out*\\n\\n- 37 5/325 Oxycodone (did CWEs most of the time)\\n\\n*I did 30mg, barely felt a buzz. Had to take 75mg the first time to nod. Ran out in less than a week because I was doing 60mg at a time*\\n\\n- 180 50mg Tramadol (was taking like 10 at a time, barely getting a buzz. Took them with a benzo though so I wouldn't have a seizure)\\n\\n*After I ran out of the Hydros and Oxy, the trams where all I had left. I'd just do them because I couldn't resist with the bottle sitting there, and I figured they wouldn't affect my tolerance break that much*\\n\\n— Also, with almost every dose I took, I was potentiating it with 800mg Cimetidine.\\n\\nI finally ran out and thought I was fucked until JJ struck me with a miracle, and I came across a TON of 10/325 oxycodone. I had 200, and within 5 days, I'm down to 149. I've been doing 60-100mg a night to nod (with the cimetidine). I just did 40mg (with cimetidine), and barely have a buzz. \\n\\nI haven't been completely clean for more than a few days for about 1.5 months now. How long is it going to take for my tolerance to reset? At baseline, with zero tolerance, I used to be able to take 30mg Oxycodone (with cimetidine) and nod hard. I want to get back to that so bad, but how long? It's fucking impossible to stay clean, sitting around knowing I have 149 percs just waiting to be swallowed. \\n\\nAny helpful information and advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you for listening to me rant. \n",

Just a few days after that, I took 60m oxy and barely got a buzz. Fuck tolerance man, I can't believe it grew this quickly.\\n\\nI wish I could find 30s on the street. I only found pressed once but they were great; not too powerful. Snorting half a pill would get me feeling good, doing the whole thing would get me nodding heavy.\\n\\nI can't find 30s though. I can't find anything. I'm so desperate that if I was confronted with the opportunity to cop some H, I couldn't refuse it. \\n\\nI used to think \"I'll never let it get to heroin\", but here I am.

I did CWEs to get the tylenol out and I was doing 40-80mg a day. Eventually, I ran out and stopped. After that I scored a few 10/325 oxycodones. I did 50mg of Oxy potentiated with Cimetidine and I barely felt anything. I figured it must be my tolerance, so I took a break for about 5 days. \\n\\nOver the last 5 days, all I've taken was some Tramadol, very low doses, like 200mg over two days. I figured that after 5 days, my tolerance would go down and I could finally get high. Well, a few hours ago I took 40mg Oxy and 25mg Benadryl on an empty stomach and I barely feel a buzz. How?!!! I used to be able to nod hard with 30-40mg, now I can't feel shit. \\n\\nHow long does it take for a tolerance to die down? Is 5 days after such a minor binge really not enough? \n",

Without a tolerance, I used to be able to take 30mg and nod. Now, I guess I developed a tolerance after using vicodin for a while, and not even 50mg of Oxy could get me high.\\n\\nI tried potentiating 50mg Oxy with 800mg Cimetidine yesterday. I felt literally nothing. It's impossible that my tolerance is that high! Is there something weird that could be happening with the cimetidine? Might it actually be preventing me from getting high? \n",

Fent has an oral bioavailability of only 50%, but intranasally its 89%, so that makes sense.\\n\\nIt takes about half a pill, snorted, to get me feeling decent. I’d say it feels like 15-20mg oxy. However, the side effects with this shit have been so much worse than any other opiate I’ve tried. This stuff makes me really, really fucking nauseous. I’ve tried taking it with Zofran (very potent nausea medication) and Benadryl for relief, but neither has really worked. \\n\\nI get nausea with other opiates as well, but the combination of Zofran and Bendadryl usually relive it completely. So I don’t know what to do. Do you guys have any suggestions for how to relieve the nausea? Will it start to go away as I do more fent? \n",

I found out about it a few months ago and I’ve been using it ever since. It worked great with Oxy and Vicodin, but ever since I lost my plug here I haven’t been able to cop either of those. \\n\\nRecently, I managed to get my hands on a few oz of codeine/promethazine. What sucks is that it’s pretty weak for me, even with zero tolerance. Since I knew it was weak, I potentiated it beforehand with Cimetidine. I chugged 3oz on an empty stomach and I didnt feel shit. I googled it and APPARENTLY codeine cannot be potentiated. Instead, the cimetidine actually makes the codeine less effective. So I just wasted the last of my drugs for fucking nothing, I didn’t even get a buzz. \n",

I don't know if I'm snorting wrong or what, but I don't get a rush when I do it. I feel a little buzz a few seconds after snorting, and then I swallow the drip from snorting three 4mg pills, and finally 30min later I'll start to feel actually high. \\n\\nI've been thinking about smoking it, since people smoke oxy.  I've only ever done oxy orally before, but I hear from people that smoking it is the only way to get a rush other than IVing. I know it's a waste in terms of bioavailability, but I'm curious about if its worth a shot. \n",

I'm assuming it wouldn't be anywhere nearly as bad as a gram of dope a day habit, but to my understanding withdrawing from 90mg oxy would still be pretty nasty. \\n\\nNow lets say I have a ton of Xanax and Benadryl at my disposal. Would it be possible to heavily sedate myself for the 7 or 8 days that I'd be facing the withdrawal symptoms and just sleep through them? I know I'd have to get up to use the bathroom and probably take a bunch of anti-diarrhea meds, but aside from that, would it be possible? \n",

There were over 100 pills in the bottle and I went through them all within 12 days. \\n\\nMy opiate of choice is oxycodone and I usually do 30mg to get me feeling right. Since vicodin is weaker, I'd have to take ~45mg to feel the same as I would with oxy. Since the vics were only 5mg each, I had to pop 9 of those suckers. \\n\\nI was too lazy to do a CWE most of the time so I'd just swallow the 9 pills whole. This worked, and it gave me a decent buzz, but it was always accompanied with a nasty headache. I could never understand why that happened until one day I figured out it must be the fucking 3000mg of APAP I took. \\n\\nAfter that I started doing CWE more often, but whenever I did the high felt weaker. It turns out I wasn't leaving the solution in the fridge long enough for the APAP to settle out. After I perfected my method, I started getting waaaaaay better results; a good mellow high with no headache. It's such a damn shame I didn't figure it out earlier. I must have wasted at least 80 of the pills before I got the CWE right. \\n\\nAnyways, I scored some more today after weeks of being dry and I'm feeling content as this sweet Vicodin begins to run through my veins :)\n",

Hmm, this isn't as easy as usual. A few minutes pass as I'm scrolling through Facebook and trying to squeeze it out. Fuck, this is a lot harder than I thought. \\n\\nI put my phone away so I can focus and I try again. Minor success, I feel a small shit nug plop into the water. I give another really hard push, bad idea. I had just abruptly begun giving birth to what was approximately the circumference of a can of fucking beans. \\n\\nMy life begun to flash before my eyes. I could literally feel my asshole being torn apart. I stopped in fear as I remembered the gif of an anal prolapse I once saw on /r/fiftyfifty. Do those happen if you push too fast? Who the fuck knows. I play it safe and push this brown monster out slowly and carefully. \\n\\nBy the time I was finished, I had tears in my eyes and I was too lightheaded to stand up. As I wiped, I noticed my asshole was at least two centimeter wider. My first Opishit. 6/10 would do again. \n",

I like oxy the most from what I've tried (20-40mg is my sweet spot), but I've also enjoyed Tussionex and liquid hydrocodone in similar doses.\\n\\nRecently all I've been able to get is codeine and that sucked, but I came across some 5/325 hydrocodones and I've been trying to have fun with them. I've taken 6 or 7 at a time, so 30-35mg and potentiated them with 800mg cimetidine, but it's sucked every time. I just end up feeling pretty sick and not that high. I take zofran for the nausea but it didn't help that much. I get sick on these whether I have a full or an empty stomach\\n\\nDoes vicodin in pill form just kind of suck compared to oxy? \n",

Just ended up getting sleepy and knocking out. The other time I tried it I had about 2oz (59mL) on an empty stomach and it hit me pretty hard.\\n\\nI'm facing a dilemma because I don't know whether to drink 2oz tonight on an empty stomach and hopefully get a decent high, or if I should wait until next week, when I'll be able to get my hands on some 5/325 hydrocodone and mix the two. \\n\\nI also have some Xanax and Cimetidine lying around, both of which I could use to potentiate the codeine. \\n\\nWhat do you guys think? \n",

Pretty nice in there, lot of hot hispanic girls. \\n\\nAt some point during the party, I sit down on a chair away from the dance floor and before I know it I start nodding out. Classic. \\n\\nWhile I'm nodding out, this dime walks up to me, pokes me and asks me if I'm sleeping. \"My bad I was nodding out\". Told her I'm quad faded and she asks me where I live. Turns out we live in the same residence hall so I finesse and bring her back up to her room. I'm so fucked up I can barely get hard, but she blew me and that fixed it. Man this chick knew how to fuckin please a guy. \\n\\nThis has to be the hottest girl I've ever hooked up and the most amazing sex I've ever had. I could've sworn I was one ugly lookin ass dude but I somehow managed to pull this chick at a party with my mouth gaping wide open and my eyes rolled back in my head. Great confidence boost forsure. She slept over and I have a feeling I'll be seeing more of her. God bless for oxy.\n",

Tastes fucking amazing after a few oxy's.\\n\\nWhy is sour candy such a big thing for people on this sub though? Does it feel like something special when you're high on opiates, or is it just coincidentally everyone's favorite snack?\n",

Last night at 3am (March 13th), I took another 25mg oxy. Before this, I had no tolerance whatsoever. \\n\\nI wanna take another 25mg right now, but I’m worried I’ve already developed a tolerance and it won’t be worth it. Is two days of use enough to make me develop a tolerance and weaken the effects of today’s dose, or am I good? \\n\\nI also have the option of taking some Tussionex instead of the oxy. What do you guys think? \\n\n",

I have a fairly low opiate tolerance right now and so it's able to do the trick pretttty well. \\n\\nLast week I was up at night writing an essay and I decided to chug a quarter pint of lean. Fucking trash man, barely got a nod in. I was lucky enough to get the lean for cheap, so I didn't mind much but the amount of money people pay for this shit blows my mind. \\n\\nOn the other hand, I got this golden nectar; the creme de la creme of cough syrups; *Tussionex*. Took a few tbsp and I was in bliss for about 10 hours. I love this stuff.\n",

How do I go about doing that? I can't snort APAP right? I assume I'm supposed to do a CWE but from what I understand that yields APAP powder and oxy water, and I don't understand how I'm supposed snort the oxy when its dissolved in water. \\n\\nAnd what are the benefits of snorting oxy? I know it hits you faster, but does it hit you harder as well? How does it effect the duration of the high? Is there a nasty drip like with cocaine? \n",

I've experimented with vicodin, liquid Vicodin, Tussionex (one of my favorites so far), lean, and oxy. However, I've never done more than 15mg oxy.\\n\\nI finally managed to come across a decent supply of oxy, and I have enough to take a big dose if I want to. I have three ideas and I'd like some input on which is a better one:\\n\\nOption 1: I take 3 of these 10/325 oxys on an empty stomach for a total of 30mg oxy\\n\\nOption 2: I take 600mg Cimetidine (Tagamet) and then I take 2 of the 10/325 oxys for a total of 20mg oxy\\n\\nOption 3: I take 600mg Cimetidine (Tagamet) and then 2.5 of of the 10/325 oxys for a total of 25mg oxy\\n\\nI want to conserve the oxy, because I don't have a lot and I can't get more. That is why I am considering using the Cimetidine, because it is supposed to help potentiate the oxy and make it stronger.\\n\\nThe problem is, I don't know how much stronger. I feel like I've never *really* nodded out, and I've heard that a 30mg roxi could take me to that next level. So that's what I'm going for here, I just want the full experience. \\n\\n*Also important: I currently have no opiate tolerance* \n",

I've been scammed before, finessed out of my money. I just have really shit luck.\\n\\nI have a friend, who I don't know *tooo* well, that recently tore his ACL and needed surgery. They gave him a ton of 10/325 oxy and he says he's been trying to cut down on it, but that he could easily get more if he wanted to.\\n\\nI don't wanna come across as a dickhead and ask him if I can buy his oxy from him, since he still might need it for his pain. But I was thinking about offering him $100 to get a new bottle for me after he didn't need it anymore. \\n\\nI took 2mg Xanax XR a few hours ago, and then 800mg Tagamet just 45min ago to potentate 15ml of Tussionex (Extended release Hydrocodone, 10mg per 5ml). I really don't feel much now and that was the last of my opiates :(\\n\\nI'm young and I suffer from chronic neck and back pain, and oxy really helps, along with making me feel a nice fuzzy high. I know I can just get some heroin but I don't want to make that jump, ever. I'm in college and I gotta do well here. \\n\\nAny advice would appreciated, thanks lads.\n",

How easy is it to do? And if I wanted to take only 15mg oxy, could I just split the OP60 into 4 equal lines, and do just one to get 15mg, or does it not work that way?\\n\\nThanks guys\\n\n",

About 3 years ago, my doctor prescribed me Xanax and it changed my life. I used to be able to take just 0.5 mg and get serious relief. Another couple years down the road, I started experiencing with opiates. That escalated very quickly. \\n\\nAt one point I needed to chew up 375mg of IR Oxy (at once) just to get high. After that I switched over to dope cause it was cheaper, and I needed at least 5 bags to feel a decent buzz. After a while I stopped being able to feel high completely. I couldn’t get that warm blanket feeling anymore even if I snorted an entire bundle. I can still nod, but that’s all it is. I just nod and fall asleep. I can’t even feel Xanax anymore. It doesn’t give me that feeling of relaxation no matter how much I take. I’ve tried taking major tolerance breaks from it but even after weeks without it, 10mg (of pharmaceutical bars) is the minimum that I need just to fall asleep. \\n\\nI think I’ve just absolutely destroyed my brain. Since I can’t even get high anymore, it’s not even the feeling of being fucked up that I crave. The reason I want to keep using is because my anxiety is unbearable. It keeps from me eating and sleeping and I have hyperhidrosis, so my hands and feet are constantly in a cold sweat because of the anxiety. \\n\\nI’ve been in detox and rehab several times but those were useless. I’ve tried Suboxone and I was on methadone for three months, but neither of them were successful in keeping me sober. Is there any hope for me? I know that I have to want to get sober, but if my anxiety doesn’t get better I don’t think I will ever have the willpower to do it.\n",

I used kratom to get through the WDs and after about two weeks I felt okay. I still had major cravings though and relapsed very recently I with either dope or fentanyl. I tried to stay clean by just getting high on suboxone.\\n\\nThe last time I did that was about two days ago, and it seemed to work. I managed to get a decent buzz from snorting about 4mg. Could I snort some right now and get the same effect, or is it likely the bupe/naloxone will still be blocking my receptors?\\n\\nCould I do it again today?\n",

At first I went up to 100 mg but then I went down to 50 mg. I’ve been on 50 mg now for at least a month and a half. I moved away from the methadone clinic I normally go to and none of the methadone clinics in my new location are willing to except patients that are also on benzo’s (I am prescribed Xanax, so they can’t take me).\\n\\nI am all out of methadone and I can’t find any dope here, so it seems like my only option is to cold turkey. All I have is Xanax, and maybe I could get my hands on some Kratom.\\n\\n\\nHow bad is it going to be?\n",

As of today, I’m up to 90mg. I got dosed at around 1:00PM today, and then around 30min later I puked. So I may have lost some of the methadone that I ingested. \\n\\nLater today, I plan on copping some dope. It might actually be fent a-dope, I’m not sure. I’ve heard that if you’re on a high dose of methadone, then you won’t be able to get high off dope anymore. \\n\\nIs 90mg enough to stop me from getting high today?\n",

I want to go back to Xanax because the Klonopin does nothing for me. I could do that if I went to the pharmacy and just returned the Klonopin. Problem is, I've already downed more than half the bottle because I was trying to get it to work. \\n\\nI only got 14 generic 2mg Clonazepam (manufactured by Actavis), and I consumed 10 of them. They're just small white pills with R35 imprinted on one side, and a break line on the other side. \\n\\nI think I can find a random pill that looks very similar to it, and I am wondering if I could just put those random pills into the bottle along with the actual 4 Clonazepam pills into the bottle and return them to the pharmacy. Is it likely that I would be successful and they'll just take the pills back so I can get prescribed Xanax, or is it more likely that that pharmacist will check each individual pill to ensure that they're all in-fact the generic 2mg Clonazepam with the R35 imprint?\n",

While I was there I was doing a methadone taper. 30mg the first day, and then when I left 5 days later on Sunday, my last dose was 5mg.\\n\\nSo if I were to do some dope today, and I got piss tested within the next few days, would it just show up as just an “opiate” cause I have methadone in my system, or would it specially show that I did dope? \\n\\nAny input is appreciated, thanks!\n",

On June 18th, while in withdrawals from a daily habit of 200-400mg oxy, I checked into a detox clinic. I was there for 5 days and they gave me a rapid methadone detox (started at 30mg and decreased 5mg everyday), so my last dose of methadone was 5mg on Sunday, the 23rd. Yesterday, I tried to get high on two doses of suboxone (it kind of worked). I took 8mg and began to nod a lil and then took another 8mg and passed out. I didn’t really feel high though, just drowsy. \\n\\nI know that there’s a certain amount of time that you can’t get high after using suboxone. I don’t want to waste my oxy/dope so I want to make sure I wait it out. How long until I can get high again?\\n\\nThanks!\n",

    \\n\\nThe avenue is wet in the grey light.\\n\\nAnd quiet.\\n\\nAnd wears a certain weariness only these kinds of thoroughfares do.\\n\\nSubmitted to the ruthlessness of the epidemic.\\n\\nIt's a desperation you see best expressed the through barbed wire fences and bars on windows,\\n\\nportrayed by the stained and gutted mattress leaning against a telephone pole and the scattered trash in the gutter.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt is the sight of hooded vagrants,\\n\\nthose anonymous and harried creatures squawking to each other about how they’ll come up this morning\\n\\nin the back of a parking lot,\\n\\nthe same way you might find a pair of squirrels or hermit thrushes stirring in the early morning stillness.\\n\\nIt’s the way their ragged figures dig through the dumpster\\n\\nand the way they hang their heads\\n\\nand push their shopping cart.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt’s in the face of the beautiful, light skinned black girl walking on the side of the road in her pink skirt\\n\\nand her high heeled ankles attached to the legs spilling out of it.\\n\\nIt’s the way she cowers from the cold and pulls her fake fur tight around her shoulders\\n\\nand follows my car with the swivel of her head trying to make eye contact.\\n\\nIt’s her fishnet stockings.\\n\\nIt’s the dark scar tissue on the backs of her hands and the line of it on her neck.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt’s the crumbling remains of abandoned and boarded up homes\\n\\ncovered in graffiti and the old storefronts of failed businesses.\\n\\nIt’s the liquor stores and the pawn shops and the payday lenders that have taken their places.\\n\\nIt’s the broken glass on the sidewalk.\\n\\nIt’s the dejected face of the man squatting on the curb.\\n\\nIt’s the motels and motel rooms with dirty doors and missing numbers, that all look like mine.\\n\\nIt’s me and who I was and a million more like me.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt’s the new great depression.\\n\\nBut it’s not economic or an absence of anything.\\n\\nIt’s the inundation of the streets with heroin and meth.\\n\\nAnd these days, I’m doing my part to keep them flooded.\n",

ruthlessness of the epidemic.\\n\\nIt's a desperation you see best expressed the through barbed wire fences and bars on windows,\\n\\nportrayed by the stained and gutted mattress leaning against a telephone pole and the scattered trash in the gutter.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt is the sight of hooded vagrants,\\n\\nthose anonymous and harried creatures squawking to each other about how they’ll come up this morning\\n\\nin the back of a parking lot,\\n\\nthe same way you might find a pair of squirrels or hermit thrushes stirring in the early morning stillness.\\n\\nIt’s the way their ragged figures dig through the dumpster\\n\\nand the way they hang their heads\\n\\nand push their shopping cart.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt’s in the face of the beautiful, light skinned black girl walking on the side of the road in her pink skirt\\n\\nand her high heeled ankles attached to the legs spilling out of it.\\n\\nIt’s the way she cowers from the cold and pulls her fake fur tight around her shoulders\\n\\nand follows my car with the swivel of her head trying to make eye contact.\\n\\nIt’s her fishnet stockings.\\n\\nIt’s the dark scar tissue on the backs of her hands and the line of it on her neck.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt’s the crumbling remains of abandoned and boarded up homes\\n\\ncovered in graffiti and the old storefronts of failed businesses.\\n\\nIt’s the liquor stores and the pawn shops and the payday lenders that have taken their places.\\n\\nIt’s the broken glass on the sidewalk.\\n\\nIt’s the dejected face of the man squatting on the curb.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt’s the motels and motel rooms with dirty doors and missing numbers, that all look like mine.\\n\\nIt’s me and who I was and a million more like me.\\n\\nIt’s the new great depression.\\n\\nBut it’s not economic or an absence of anything.\\n\\nIt’s the inundation of the streets with heroin and meth.\n",

                                                                                       \\n\\n70\\n\\nThe first signs of light are in the sky.\\n\\nThe avenue is wet in the grey light. And quiet. And wears a certain weariness only these kinds of thoroughfares do. Submitted to the ruthlessness of the epidemic. It's a desperation you see best expressed the through barbed wire fences and bars on windows, portrayed by the stained and gutted mattress leaning against a telephone pole and the scattered trash in the gutter. It is the sight of hooded vagrants, those anonymous and harried creatures squawking to each other about how they’ll come up this morning in the back of a parking lot, the same way you might find a pair of squirrels or hermit thrushes stirring in the early morning stillness. It’s the way their ragged figures dig through the dumpster and the way they hang their heads and push their shopping cart. \\n\\nIt’s in the face of the beautiful, light skinned black girl walking on the side of the road in her pink skirt and her high heeled ankles attached to the legs spilling out of it. It’s the way she cowers from the cold and pulls her fake fur tight around her shoulders and follows my car with the swivel of her head trying to make eye contact. It’s her fishnet stockings. It’s the dark scar tissue on the backs of her hands and the line of it on her neck. \\n\\nIt’s the crumbling remains of abandoned and boarded up homes covered in graffiti and the old storefronts of failed businesses. It’s the liquor stores and the pawn shops and the payday lenders that have taken their places.It’s the broken glass on the sidewalk. It’s the dejected face of the man squatting on the curb with his head in his hands. It’s the motels and motel rooms with dirty doors and missing numbers, that all look like mine. \\n\\nIt’s me and who I was and a million more like me. It’s the new great depression. But it’s not economic or an absence of anything. It’s the inundation of the streets with heroin and meth. And these days, I’m doing my part to keep the streets flooded. \\n\\nOnce I get to the end of the strip and see the driveway of the motel, I pull into the parking lot. Open the door to my room. Weigh out four ounces really quickly and put the rest of everything under the bed, where I keep the gun. Well, almost all of the rest of everything, because I steal a rock of dope the size of my pinky nail and hide it in the cellophane on my soft pack of Winston’s. It’s insurance on the fact that Charlie ripped me off by watering down his methadone. I’m not sure when I’ll get sick.  \\n\\nNow, most people would think that leaving a gun under the bed in a motel room like that is a terrible idea. And they’d be right. Those same people would probably think that leaving 31.274 ounces of the best heroin in the city under the bed and leaving it there with the gun is an exponentially worse idea. And they’d be right about that, too. But the thing is that I didn’t really think it all through. I just sort of bought the gun. Never considered how much I don’t really like them and how unnecessary one would be for me, so I leave it there. I’ve said that before, I think. \\n\\nLeaving town is a hassle, though, because my business depends on me being in town to take care of my customers, especially the big ones. And besides, I don’t really care because, like I’ve said before, there are piles and piles of money in my crawl space at home. If someone were to rob me, I’m in position to buy right back in, many, many times over. \\n\\nSo, I take the four ounces. Lock my door behind me. And knock on Eddie’s. It takes a minute for anything to stir on the other side of the door, but finally, there’s some movement. And a sleepy, angry mumbling asks me through the door,\\n\\n“Who is it?”\\n\\n“Me. Randy.”\\n\\nThe chain unlatches immediately. Eddie’s eyes are still closed, but he invites me in and turns the bathroom light on so his girlfriend can keep sleeping and we can talk. \\n\\n“I’m going out of town till tomorrow, probably.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Yeah. So, I have a couple of people that might be trying to reup while I’m gone. And I wanted to give you yours, so here are four. They’re separated to keep things easy. I might call or text you to tell you who’s coming to get one. My boy Martin is probably gonna hit you up. And I think Cowboy is due for one. Just be on the lookout for my texts.”\\n\\n“K. Cool, bro. Here.” He reaches under his mattress and hands me a stack of bills. \\n\\n“Cool. For yesterday?”\\n\\n“Yup.”\\n\\n“Word. Well, I’ll be back tomorrow. Should be, anyway.”\n",

in the corner. It had been a hard night for me, because I was sick and mostly unable to sleep from a lack of heroin. He sat up and patted his chest to feel for the bottles when he woke up at around 10 and pulled the bottles out. Eleven pills had turned into four while he slept. He looked at me angry and desperate. I said, \\n\\n“I’m sorry!”\\n\\nI made empty promises to repay him, but when he demanded proof, I ripped the microwave out of the wall and stuffed it into the red roll-around suitcase. It still had a laminated card from my grandmother’s travel agency and my own information from my flight to New Mexico. \\n\\n“Call Luna! Tell him to bring a dub!” A dub is a twenty-dollar bag. \\n\\n“What? You think he is going to want that nasty little thing? You’ve lost it.”\\n\\n“Just call him! I’ll deal with him when he gets here!”\\n\\nLarry called our dealer, and I could tell Luna was trying to confirm that we had money over the phone, but Larry danced around it until Luna agreed to come anyway. I slid my arms into the sleeves of my NASCAR racing jacket and headed across the parking lot with Larry hobbling on crutches. It was a no. 24 Jeff Gordon racing jacket, bright red with blue flames up the sleeves and a bright blue DUPONT logo on the front. My mom had ordered it for me brand-new, to replace the old dirty one she made me throw away in California. Larry’s crutches creaked in the cold across the asphalt. The suitcase rolled behind me and half of the microwave stuck out. The power cord dragged behind.\\n\\nMy life had finally all unraveled. \n",

Big Bag was making a move from out on the mesa into town. He intended to capitalize on the isolated heroin market there. We rode with him and his leather-skinned girlfriend on the back roads down to another small town for ounces of heroin, and when we got back to town Danielle and I used our network of junkies to sell his dope. It wasn’t a week before we ripped him off for a bunch of dope. He offered anyone in town a $50 bag for our whereabouts and left promises to murder me on her voicemail. \\n\\nWe shorted other junkies. They hated us. We stole merchandise and food from businesses. The owners and employees hated us. Several cops in town knew that I was driving the Camry and that I had a girlfriend. They hated us too, but we hated each other most of all.\\n\\nDanielle had a monthly prescription for 90 Klonopin and an SSI check available on the first. We shot so much dope and took so many pills the first week of the month that our only friend quit hanging out with us. When her orange pill bottle quit rattling and the check was spent, anxiety wrought havoc. She left me freezing at the gas station at three in the morning while I was buying cigarettes and drove by a few times, screaming and giving me the finger for no reason.  Later in the night, we went to the ER looking for meds.\\n\\nHer Camry became our home. We cleaned out the ashtray at the casino for half smoked butts several times a day and listened to Depeche Mode and Seminole Wind by John Anderson. Our diet consisted entirely of Wendy’s spicy chicken nuggets and Baja Blast. She made me give her a shot of dope visibly mixed with my own blood, to intentionally contract Hepatitis C. That way I could no longer use contamination as an excuse for why I wouldn’t share a hit or a rinse with her. One afternoon I pulled over on the side of the highway and proposed to her with her own wooden ring made from an old long board. She said yes and we made out like two outlaws in love.\n",

The cartoon. Not the movies. I’m not exactly sure why that is. I think there was a character named Winston or something. Maybe, it was the black guy. I think that was his name, right? Or was it Ray? I remember a Ray for sure. I don’t know, though. I just know that's why I like them, because they remind me of Ghostbusters cartoons and being a kid on Saturday mornings.\\n\\nNow, Beth is sitting on the floor asking me for one. I buy soft packs. They’re retro, kind of, at least to me, and so I pick one out of the soft pack in my pocket, and they’re all smushed but not broken, and she reaches up and grabs the lighter from off the scratched coffee table in front of the couch. It’s the one I helped her pull out of a dumpster after the colleges went to summer break last year. She turns her head to keep from setting her hair on fire as she lights the smoke and asks me,\\n\\n“What’s up?”\\n\\n“You know. Same old. Same old.” The banter of some old macho cowboy is blaring in the background. Black and white images flicker on the screen.\\n\\n“This is not the same old, same old, Randy.”\\n\\n“Are you sure? Seems like it to me.”\\n\\n“Yeah. I know better than that. I’m not tripping on you or nothing. You just don’t ever come over here on a Thursday morning. You have a job, remember? Or am I wrong about that?”\\n\\nI don’t say anything. Just smile.\\n\\n“Got fired?” She asks.\\n\\n“No. Not exactly. I wouldn’t say that.”\\n\\n“What would you say?” She squints at me.\\n\\n“It was time to retire from my career as a valet. What? You don’t think there’s a time to move on from something?”\\n\\n“Yeah. But, usually, when someone moves on from something, they have something to move onto. Ya know?”\\n\\n“And what exactly do you think I’m here for?”\\n\\n“Oh. So. You moved onto me, have you?” Her words are sweet and full of a certain sadness.\\n\\n“Yeah. I don’t see why not, baby.” I smile big.\\n\\n“Baby? I’m not your baby. Besides. George wouldn’t have it.” George is her sugar daddy. He immigrated over here as a kid but now pays her rent and bills in exchange for whenever he wants her companionship. It’s hard to think that they have sex, but I don’t know. It’s not my business. Either way, he’s not possessive of her. A true sugar daddy.\\n\\n“What’s George gotta know about it?”\\n\\n“Um. He pays the rent, dude. He’s gonna know if you live here. He comes by with groceries twice a week and has the right to come in whenever he wants.” Old George won’t have it. Beth’s right. “You can stay tonight. That’s not an issue. It’s anything after that I’m worried about.”\\n\\nI nod and look up at one of her baby doll heads. Beth has a thing about decapitating baby dolls and painting them. It’s her artistic expression. At least, that’s what she says. Her baby cries from the back room, and Beth runs to go get her. I haven’t seen the child since Beth first had her and brought her to all the meetings for everyone to meet, like it was this awkward pink and grey ball of mashed up hamburger meat in a napkin that we were all supposed to pass around and be excited about. You know?\\n\\nMaybe that makes me sound like a bad guy, and in all honesty, I wouldn’t even try to pretend that I’m not, but this isn’t that. Not exactly. What I’m talking about is more like an inability to recognize the feelings other people seem to be having in myself, like I know I should feel a certain way about something but don’t. Like when I was 10 years old and went to a baseball game with my step dad, and the home team hit one out of the park with two runners on base. The crowd went nuts. They stood and clapped and cheered and howled. I just couldn’t believe it. I couldn’t believe that a whole stadium of grown people and kids and crusty geezers and all of them were just so over the moon with the fact that this guy swung a stick which knocked a ball over the fence.\\n\\nSo, Beth comes back in with her daughter who, apparently, has turned into an extremely selfish and irrationally angry monkey over the last ten months. The child pulls Beth’s hair and screams. She knocks things over and laughs. It seems like children always want to do the worst possible thing they can, like play with the chemicals under the sink or stick something in an electrical outlet or crush themselves by climbing on cabinets and pulling them down on top of themselves, but I’m not much different. I like poison. I like doing things that will probably get me killed. It just goes to show you that for some of us, nothing ever changes.\\n\\nI ask Beth if I can use her Facebook messenger to message someone. She hands her phone over. Sal is as easy to find as he said he would be. He comes right up and even responds to my text immediately. I text my number and wait on the couch for the call. There are six 20-dollar bills in my wallet. Sal’s got the fire.\n",

Park in the parking lot and sit in the car with the dome light on. She pulls a pair of scissors out of her purse. Does her best to stand up in the driver’s seat. But she’s not actually standing because the car is too small. Just has her legs straight and feet pushing into the floorboard, so she can get her face right in the rearview mirror to see what she’s doing. And she starts cutting her hair. \\n\\nAt first, it’s looking good, like she knows what’s she’s doing. Going for a punkish, heroin chic look and it’s kind of nice, but I’m pretty sure she’s tweaking even though she won’t admit it, and so she doesn’t stop at good enough. Now, it’s this choppy mess of divots revealing her egg white scalp between the ugly, poofy tufts of her hair, like an animal come from the shearer. Her head looks smaller, so her eyes look bigger, and in them, a certain amount of mental illness and pale death glimmers.\\n\\nAnyway, the cotton fever does seem to be getting better. My back doesn’t hurt as much. No trembling. No retching for the last half hour or so. It’s hard for me to tell. I could probably just have her give me the keys back, but she’s been so nice about it. Took care of me. Even helped me change my pants after I messed myself. And went to the store for Gatorade and water to help me hydrate. \\n\\n“It’s only a few minutes from Jesse’s house. I’ll be a half hour. Tops. I promise, and Jesse’s cool. Just come up with me. You can sit there with him till I get back. Okay. Sound good?”\\n\\nIt doesn’t sound good. I just feel so weak. And she seems so insistent, and for some reason, I say,\\n\\n“Okay, whatever,” against all my better judgement. \\n\\n“Cool. Follow me.”\\n\\nI stagger across the black parking lot and step through a cold puddle which soaks my shoe through to the sock. Moving my body brings on the nausea, again. I double over. I retch. A few drops of bitter stomach bile comes out of my mouth into some grass and a string of mucous hangs from one nostril. She’s just standing there. Her hand in her pocket. The other on the phone and one leg is moving. Finally, I stand back up and follow her up a concrete stairway. \\n\\nShe walks right into the apartment. No knock. There’s a filthy trashcan by the door overflowing with trash and another bag in a puddle of whatever is leaking out of it onto the floor. Through a small kitchenette we enter the living room. A fat and shirtless man sitting on the couch playing a video game. There is no hair on his chest. It’s very weird. I think for a moment maybe it’s his shape that makes him look so odd, before I realize that it’s the lack of shape that’s so strange. \\n\\n“Hey. Jesse. This is Randy.”\\n\\nHe doesn’t look up. But he does seem to suffer from a gnarly, neck condition where the overhanging fat on his chin has created a hard to clean crevice where a blackish ring of grease and dirt has formed. Flecks of skin are missing. The lower red and raw layers are showing. \\n\\n“He doesn’t really talk when he’s playing his games. But, like I said, Randy. I’ll be right back.”\\n\\n“Yeah. Okay. Hurry.”\\n\\n“Sit here.”\\n\\nShe pulls a wooden chair up to the side of the coffee table in the middle of the room. I sit. The door closes as she leaves. It’s hard to get comfortable, but the exhaustion from having to deal with my cotton fever all day. My eyes close a minute. I wake up. Everything looks the same, but it seems like some amount of time has passed. I feel pretty good. The rest helped.\\n\\nSo, I turn to the guy to introduce myself and ask him what he does for a living and would he mind if I did a shot right here in the living room. So, I’m looking. Waiting for a response. And realize that he is sweating out this cloudy liquid. It hangs in droplets form his chin and nose, like the runoff from a bowl of ramen noodles or some other very salty liquid. The whole place smells like the condiments that come on happy meal hamburgers, and there is not only a greasy black ring around his neck but also around his body staining the fabric of the couch. \\n\\nI’m still looking. Still waiting for him to talk. There’s no response. No information about where he works. Or even if he works. What his feelings are about me doing drugs in his living room. Nothing. So, I get some water out of the kitchen and use this clear plastic top off a bottle. \\n\\nWhat should take a few seconds takes 30 minutes. It’s messy. I’m bleeding. I can smell the iron in my blood, black and coagulating on my arm. Finally, I get it. It’s in. And, there’s this heavy feeling, something I’ve felt before. It’s an overdose. My body stiffens and flops in that weird way that means I need some Narcan or I won’t be waking up. \n",

nap.\\n\\nAfter taking that methadone and smoking that cigarette. Usually, I’m nodded out on a good hit of dope after getting back home from the trap but not today. This afternoon I’m just resting up before getting ready to meet Leticia’s family, and something about the methadone lets me dream more vividly than I usually do when I’ve done heroin. So, I’m lying there and dreaming that my dad is calling me on one of those old phones with one of those old school curly cords. He’s excited. He’s almost shouting about how he woke up at three a.m. to cook his favorite chocolate muffins. My dad wants me to give him a haircut later. I don’t cut hair. Never have. It doesn’t make sense. Dreams never really do, but my dad is so proud of his muffins in the dream, and he’s so happy about the haircut, and the whole thing is so, so real to me that I’m openly weeping. I am wailing over the line, because I miss him so badly. \\n\\nAnd then I wake up. Whimpering like a dog. And sit up. Light a cigarette and take a minute to reconcile the very real grief in my heart and the tears on my face and the conversation I just had with my dad on the phone about his muffins with the reality of my empty apartment and the fact that my father has been dead for 14 years now. Still, it takes a minute to swallow it, to let these feelings pass.\\n\\nI walk to the bathroom. And strip. Take a shower. Get out. Dry off and wipe the fog from the mirror to shave my stubble. Brush my teeth, and after that I stand there staring into the mirror and making funny faces and silly voices quoting lines from movies and things like that, until I finally tell myself what I really want to say, what I really feel and think about myself, which is,\\n\\n“I hate you,” and continue getting dressed in the living room.\\n\\nNow, I’m not sure if I’ve told you that I keep large bags of brand-new socks and boxers to wear. When I’m finished, I put them in a trash bag. My plan is to have Sharky or Charlie take them to the Goodwill or one of the secondhand stores, soon. And it’s funny, because just as I’m thinking about when the next time I’ll see them, there’s a knocking at my door.\\n\\nIt’s the sort of obnoxious knocking that I associate with Sharky. It’s a heavy policelike pounding, whereas Charlie just taps. And Sal is the only other person who knows where I live, but he just meets me at the room every morning. So, I know it’s not him. And it’s not Charlie. It’s Sharky.\\n\\nSo, I open the door. Sharky is standing there. He walks right in and hands me a piece of paper. It says something written in permanent marker.\\n\\n“Here.” Sharky says. “Found this taped to your door. Weird message, bro. What’s that about?”\\n\\n“You read it?”\\n\\n“Yeah.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“I don’t know. I just saw it. It was right out in the open. Kinda hard not to read it, don’t ya think?”\\n\\n“I guess. Let me see….”\\n\\nI hold the piece of paper out in front of me and see the piece of tape hanging off the top of it. The print is strangely familiar. It’s the same crude handwriting that had been on that note taped to the door at the motel a month ago. Maybe, it’s been longer. I can’t remember. Either way, though, the last one was a warning, and so is this one. \\n\\nIt goes like this:\\n\\nHey Weenus,\\n\\nWe told you before. This is your last warning. We know what you’re doing. Knock it off, or you’re going to pay the price. Last chance. \\n\\nLast time this anonymous group, who I imagine as angry and adolescent boys, left me a letter it, it addressed me as Dill Hole. I guess Weenus is better. Not really sure how I feel about that, but either way, anxiety creeps in. This makes me feel so weird and worried. It’s almost like it has to be a joke. \\n\\n“Anyway, bro. I came for a piece.” Says Sharky.\\n\\n“Ok. Sure. What you want?”\\n\\n“I got a stick on me.” Stick is what Sharky calls 1000 dollars. He’s the only person I’ve ever heard call a grand a stick.\\n\\n“Okay. So, the usual, then?”\\n\\n“Yeah.”\\n\\nI go back to the room. Weigh out what he wants. Bring it back to him in the living room and say,\\n\\n“Here you go.”\\n\\n“Thanks.”\\n\\n“No problem, man. But, hey. I gotta bounce out right now. Before I go though, will you take this?” \\n\\nI pick up the black trash bag full of my dirty socks and underwear.\\n\\n“Sure. What is it?”\\n\\n“Some dirty clothes.”\\n\\n“Haha. What do I want those for?”\\n\\n“I was wondering if you’d just take it to the Goodwill and drop it off outside.”\\n\\n“Okay. Sure, man. Whatever you say.”\\n\\n“Good. I appreciate it.”\\n\\n“Yeah. Man. Where you off to, anyways?”\\n\\n“My…..” I’m not sure what to call Leticia. Is she my girlfriend? Not yet. My friend? Well, yes, but she’s also more than that. I don’t know, so I just say, “I’m going to meet this girl’s family. You know?”\\n\\n“Sure. That’s good, Vonnejunk. You got you a girlfriend.” \\n\\n“She’s not my girlfriend.”\\n\\n“What is she then?”\\n\\n“My friend. My friend that I want to make my girlfriend.”\\n\\n“Nice. Good luck, dude. See ya later.”\\n\\nHe slings the trash bag over his shoulder and lets the door slam on his way out. I am so nervous, now that he’s gone. It’s like the silence and vacuum allow me to feel what I need to feel. That letter is so harrowing. And that on top of having to go meet Leticia’s whole family at once. It’s too much. But I find a belt and put it on. I’m still buckling it as I walk out the door and finish before I hit the stairway. \n",

Interestingly it seems to have an intelligent strategy in spreading itself from its hosts to others. The facts associated with different kinds of super bugs, hemorrhagic fever and the disproportionate number of white women from the states of Texas and California having Morgellon’s disease fascinate me. Recreational research of diseases can be fun, but first-hand experiences with them are not. I have had Hepatitis C, multiple abscesses, one infected deep vein thrombosis, cellulitis in my arm and what may have been sarcoptic mange once, but the worst disease I ever had was my own self. It was even worse than the time MRSA devoured my spine and that epidural abscess almost crushed it.\\n\\nWhen Angie, Cade and I got off the bus, we scored 3 20-dollar balloons of heroin first thing from a guy outside of Powell’s bookstore. It was Saturday night, and drunken college students littered the sidewalks outside of the bars in the night. Cigarette smoke and slurred conversation filled the air and came from people who had no idea what life was like for my kind. They would go back to their beds in their apartments after spending 100 dollars at the bar. I would sleep on the cold concrete in one of the doorways down the street with my head inches from the puddles they would tromp their stylish leather shoes through on the way home.\\n\\nWe all split up, and I lost my piece of heroin in a Pita Pit bathroom. The bars closed when I found Cade and tried to sleep on the pavement next to him. Unlike the place we came from, we did not know the ins and outs of homelessness in this new place. We had played like kids on a jungle gym in the city we lived in before but didn’t even know where to find cardboard to sleep on.\\n\\nAngie found us in the morning, and we got high one more time before we parted ways for good. I lived at the Joyce while my parents paid the rent, because I promised them that I was taking every possible step to get into a place called Hooper detox. Truthfully, I had never been there or even called, and I wasn’t taking any steps to get in.\\n\\nI paid 50 something dollars a night, but I told them it cost 80 and used the extra to buy heroin. The dive from paying 20 bucks for 300 milligrams of morphine on pill hill in the Tenderloin to the 20-dollar mouse turds of mediocre heroine I bought from the guy on the 3rd floor of the Joyce was hard to stomach. It never gave me what I wanted, and I was sick by 4 every morning. I did a lot of rinses to pass the time and injected some ashy water in my forearm on afternoon.\\n\\nThat night I got cotton fever. It started like always with sweaty chills and severe bone and muscle aches. My head pounded and the shakes steadily grew with a kidney pain. The shakes turned into jerking convulsions and lifted me off the bed like Linda Blair. I puked on the floor and sheets. My mouth and throat parched till my lips stuck together. I cried for water. I tried to drink and wretched it all back up a second later. I puked and pooped in the common shower down the hall. My head and kidneys hurt so bad I cried and puked some more. I did not sleep. “At least Ebola kills you.” I thought to myself as the sun came up. CNN showed Gaddafi bloodied and beaten by his enemies. He had been captured in Libya.\\n\\nMy parents sent the money for the day, and the dealer had to make change in his room after he gave me the 20-dollar balloon. While I cooked up my hit, a pebbly slime rose in my chest, and I almost peed my pants. I grabbed the small trashcan to pee into and puked into it simultaneously. A large squirt of diarrhea ran down my leg, and it took a second to collect myself, before I did the shot. My dealer met me in the hallway with the 60 dollars for rent on my way to the shower.\\n\\nAfter the shower, I watched TV for a while and tried to relax. When I went to pay rent at the front desk I realized that I had left the money in the bathroom. It was gone, and I told management that I had to go pick up another Western Union at Safeway. My dad yelled at me over the phone about having to send more money.\\n\\nI wore the only thing in my room that wasn’t plastered with excrement, a pair of pajama pants, completely ripped from the crotch and down the leg and no underwear. It was cold and the 10 blocks back to Safeway were embarrassing while I tried to keep the thin, ripped fabric from exposing my private parts on the street. I waited two hours for the money, but when I returned to the Joyce management kicked me out for finding a syringe under my bed and the smell coming out of the trashcan. They seemed to think that I was defecating in it. The front desk clerk, an inadequate type with thick rimmed glasses, a skinny neck and a buzz cut, told me about finding an overdosed body in one of the rooms last week and gave me a pair of jeans that were too small. The pink and white frosting on my animal cookies provoked my guts to gurgling again while I listened. Perhaps, the treat was a bit premature.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFor the next three mornings, I walked to the MAX in the dark and took the red line to the Rose Quarter.  Being new to town, I thought it seemed like an amazing place to live.  It was progressive and of a size somewhere between a town and a city.  It boasted one of the top public transit systems in the nation.  Everyone bought their milk and eggs from the farmer’s markets and rode retro fixed gear bikes with skinny tires and smoked weed.  However cool of a place it was to live, I still slept outside, and it would never be that cool for me.       But at least I was finally fulfilling my promise to my parents about trying to get into the detox, and I slept in an asphalt parking lot with a jacket over my legs through the cold nights.  Hooper took me in on the third morning, but the day before that, my arm turned into a thick piece of oak firewood, hard and swollen and excruciating.  The ER at Good Samaritan Hospital told me it was cellulitis, and when I first got there the doctors and nurses sneered at the smell in the room.  Fish scales of hardened, dead skin covered the soles of my feet from the black and white Adidas I found and had worn for weeks without socks. \\n\\nThe medical detox at Hooper was easy for me, except that no amount of washing my feet helped. It became an unsettling stench that started light, but the longer I sat in any one place, everyone had to ask, “What is that smell? Whoah! What is that?” I watched movies, ate graham crackers and drank milk, until they gave out Trazodone at eight p.m. After seven days I took my last two milligrams of buprenorphine and left three days later to a sober living facility called the 8x8.\\n\\nMen and women who had struggled with addiction or alcoholism lived in the tiny rooms of the 8x8. Each room had a kitchenette and toilet. The city paid our rent so long as we attended five meetings a week and stayed sober. I lived on the sixth floor, and all but one girl on the floor had already relapsed.\\n\\nMy first two weeks there something in my spine hurt like I never hurt before, and I took 24 IB profens every six hours to sleep. My stomach bled inside from the pills, and everyone said that I should go to the ER. I refused to go but moaned and wailed loudly every night in the lobby of the 8x8. The black lady who worked the front desk at night couldn’t stand it or me for that matter. It was easily the worst pain of my entire life, and when my mom came to visit me on Thanksgiving Day, she said,\\n\\n“No one’s face looks like yours does, that doesn’t need to go to the hospital.”\\n\\nWe took a taxi to Good Samaritan to see what they said. It was my idea that after the CT scan I would go smoke a cigarette, but they said,\\n\\n“You have infected discs in your back, and it looks like some vertebral osteomyelitis. That’s infected bone. We’ll get you up to a room as soon as we can and start a round of antibiotics now. I was going to give you some dilaudid, but your mother says you’re a recovering addict, so we’ll stick with Percocet, ten milligrams every 6 hours.”\\n\\n“Um. So, can I go smoke now?”\\n\\n“No. I’m sorry.”\\n\\nI needed a cigarette. Ten milligrams of Percocet every five minutes couldn’t touch my tolerance or the pain. My back hurt, and I thought my mom should have minded her own business.\\n\\n“Well, Momma, you know what I think, right?”\\n\\n“No. What do you think, Riley?”\\n\\n“F\\*\\*\\* this s\\*\\*\\* show is what the f\\*\\*\\* I think! Just a bunch of stupid mother***ers around here!” I reminded myself of Buffalo, and the doctor shrugged before she walked out of the room. “Mother f***er!”\\n\\nOn the third floor of the hospital my mom brought me Thai food and several bottles of IB profen, but it wasn’t long before the doctors discovered the IB profen and took it from me. They said 4800 milligrams every six hours was not good for me, even if it was the only thing that worked. Later that night I chased my mom out of the room, slammed the door and threw my dinner tray on the floor, so the doctors wrote me an order for three milligrams of liquid morphine. It didn’t work, and they seemed surprised that I wasn’t more thankful.\\n\\nThe next afternoon I got an EKG to see if I had vegetative growths on my heart valves, otherwise known as endocarditis. If I did, things were worse than I could imagine, but while the tech and his helper ran a piece of cold metal through the slime on my chest, one of my friends from the 8x8 showed up with some heroine. I demanded to use the bathroom, and after a minute I pulled my friend into the bathroom in front of the technicians and locked the door. We took 15 minutes to fix, so the nurse knocked and made me, “COME OUT OF THERE, NOW!”\\n\\nAt one a.m. a few days later my legs tingled and quit working so well. I couldn’t use the bathroom, so a middle aged blonde woman came in and gave me a catheter. The night doctor ordered another MRI. I could not even move my feet an inch by the time they rolled me down the hall. My blood pressure skyrocketed, and in the morning my regular doctors came to see me. The Asian one asked me if I thought four milligrams of dilaudid would be enough, or if I wanted more. To make my point about not drug seeking I asked for two milligrams, and I cried.\\n\\nI told the anesthesiologist in the OR,\\n\\n“I’ve never had surgery before.”\\n\\n“Well, you’ll be fine, sweetie. Can you count from 100 backwards for me?”\\n\\n“100……99…….98……97….96…95…….”\\n\\nI woke up to feel the warmth of the fentanyl evaporating and sweaty desperation forming on my brow. There were new pains in my back from where the surgeon laid open the meat and used power tools to cut into my vertebra and sowed a seam of fishing line through the skin over my spine. A pretty x-ray tech slid a cold metal case behind me shortly after I woke up, and I screamed. Different nurses brought me dilaudid and morphine every few hours. After five days of sleepy agony, I slid out of bed and used my walker and arms to get my first shower with my mom’s help. Before I left a lady used a sonogram to run a thin rubber tube through a vein in my arm into my heart called a PICC line. It was painless, and I was never supposed to mess with it for fear of infection or affecting my heart. A mesh band held the capped nozzle against the skin of my upper arm, and a week after the surgery my mother helped move me into an assisted living facility.\\n\\nI shuffled with my walker everywhere I went.\\n\\nIt took me fifteen days before I could walk unassisted, and my own toes only tripped me up occasionally. 23 days after surgery I had my first bowel movement and had not gone for several days before that. The resident doctor at the retirement home stopped in to see me.\\n\\n“How are you doing?” “Good. What happened to your arm, Doc?”\\n\\n“I had a skiing accident. It’s okay though. I’ll be out of this sling in a few weeks. How are you doing coming off of the dilaudid? When was your last dose? Let’s see…..”\\n\\n“Um. I think yesterday morning. I think I feel okay. You know? I mean the doctor at the hospital told me that a lot of people think child birth or kidney stones are the most painful things a person can go through, but she said that’s because epidural abscesses are so rare.”\\n\\n“Yeah. That’s for sure. I can’t imagine what that’s like, but you say you feel okay for now without the dilaudid?”\\n\\n“Yeah, Doc. I’m feeling okay.”\\n\\n“Good. Well I’m going to get a drug test from you. Let the nurse know when you are ready to pee.”\\n\\nThe surprise of a drug test made me paranoid, so I saved a bottle of pee in a bottle in case they ever gave me another one. It was more boring and comfortable in the retirement home than the streets, but it was as sad. The eerie stink and dread of leather skinned shadows leaked into the hallway while they waited for death in their rooms. Sometimes I caught glimpses of straight faced families staring at the floor and sitting around the grey skeleton of their grandfather in bed, his mouth open, his eyes absent, a tangle of tubes and wires running from him to softly beeping machines. The swollen-eyed nurses lost two or three patients a week.\\n\\nThe retirement home wanted to send me home after six weeks of antibiotics, but I wasn’t ready to give up my PICC line or hospital bed or cable TV or the morphine, so I demanded that they send me back to Good Samaritan for an MRI. The results showed that my spine had only deteriorated since I arrived at the facility, and the doctor wrote me orders for six mg of dilaudid every four hours and upped my morphine besides adding Ativan, as needed.\\n\\nAn old, orange lady who I called Garfield and a young African immigrant took care of my meds, and I kept them under my tongue until I got back to my room, where I administered them to myself through my PICC line. Whenever I took a shower I used a plastic card to try scraping the crocodile skin on the bottoms of my feet, and at night I snuck out of my window and walked down to a trailer park to buy meth or heroine.\\n\\nMy nurses all knew I was high but couldn’t figure out how I got it, and the administrators gave me a drug test when the maid found blackened spoons in my bathroom. When they gave me the cup, I used the old urine I saved from before. One of the administrators came to see me the next day.\\n\\n“So, Mr. Chapman, when those results come back from the lab, you’ll be out of here.” Her tone conveyed disgust and rejoicing at the prospect of my expulsion. I was on my second round of antibiotics after the first ones didn’t work.\\n\\n“Okay. Well, aren’t you sending it to a lab?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“So, you’ll know what’s in my system, right? You’ll be able to know if it was heroin or morphine, right?”\\n\\n“Exactly. We’ll know you were doing heroin and you’ll be gone.”\\n\\n“No. I won’t.”\\n\\n“Yes, you will, and then you’ll probably die of the infection. Do you have anything to say for yourself, after throwing away your life like this?”\\n\\n“Yeah, I do. Get the f\\*\\*\\* out of my room and leave me the f\\*\\*\\* alone until you have those results! I’m watching cartoons!”\\n\\nShe didn’t have a response, but she left. I got caught smoking cigarettes in my room at night by one of the nursing assistants, but got away with it. Joints were harder to smoke, but I smoked them in the room too. They knew I used my PICC line to inject my painkillers, because it ballooned out where I clogged it and had to be replaced. All but one of the nurses hated my guts and wanted to get rid of me. The one who didn’t hate me spent extra time in my room watching Comedy Central Roasts and went to the store to buy me every flavor of Laffy Taffy. She talked to me about sex with her boyfriend and how he didn’t love her like she loved him. Other nurses would make up reasons to come into the room and check my charts or IV pump when she lingered awkwardly talking to me.\\n\\nBack home my family expected me to die, so my father visited to boost my spirits and maybe spend some of our last time together. I didn’t know that’s what they thought, but my father had concluded from everything he heard that I would be lucky to live. We watched my new favorite movie Drive with Ryan Gosling and Brian Cranston when he came, and he brought a king cake for the nurses. At Buffalo Wild Wings we split a six piece of wings and an appetizer of spinach dip, which was different. I always ate a lot of food and quickly, but the regimen of dilaudid and morphine and the hospital bed suppressed my appetite. My stomach had shrunk so that I could barely eat, and he attributed my lethargy and lightheadedness to anemia. He made me get my haircut and beard shaved off. When I got back to the home, an older nurse said, “Boy! You got me all turned on, and I’m black!”\\n\\nOver the phone he told me what tests to make the doctors run and what numbers were good or acceptable and what was bad. We watched the numbers of my erythrocyte sedimentation rate closest and felt relieved when it went down. He saved my life for the umpteenth time, and after three months they let me go with an envelope of 12 dilaudid and a few prescriptions to be filled in New Orleans.\\n\\nI gave the nurses one last headache when I snuck out of the facility with my PICC line in. One nurse wanted to take it out, but I told her the next nurse on shift would. When the next nurse came on I told her the one before had already taken it out, and I left in a hurry. The muscles burned in my atrophied body, and I wheezed all the way to the bus stop. If there was ever an appropriate time to refrain from smoking cigarettes this was it, but I smoked at least three Camel 99s before I made it four blocks to the bus stop. In the airport bathroom, I mixed up 24 milligrams of dilaudid and pushed it down my PICC line, but my body only tingled for a second. Then I felt like nothing but sober.\\n\\nBetween flights my dad called me,\\n\\n“Seems they have a big brouhaha over at the old folks’ home you were living in.”\\n\\n“Really? How do you know that?”\\n\\n“Well, they called us, pretty frantic. Did you get out of there with your PICC line in?”\\n\\n“Yeah. I still have it in.”\\n\\n“S\\*\\*\\*! Riley!”\\n\\n“It’s okay. I’ll take it out myself.”\\n\\n“I don’t know about that. I think that’s dangerous. Let’s figure it out when you get here.”\\n\\n“Okay. Sounds good. We’re about to take off.” I walked to the aircraft’s bathroom, and it moved in my heart and through my chest as I pulled two feet of thin tubing out of my arm. It was probably a biohazard, and I thought about that before disposing of it in the waste bin.\\n\\nMy luggage got lost on the plane, but a man delivered it all by three a.m. There were a few morphine pills in my bags, so I took them as soon as they showed up. In the morning my mom took me to get my dilaudid prescription filled, but since it was from Oregon they would only fill the morphine and Ativan, no dilaudid. I refused to get the morphine filled as some sort of self-destructive protest but insisted on the Ativan. An old roach from one of my parents’ parties gave me a head change, before my sisters took me to eat lunch at Frankie and Johnny’s.\\n\\nMy sisters kept looking down and putting their hands over their eyes when I talked to the waitress. They said, “Come on, Riley! Stop!” They found my attitude and tone appalling. The younger one laughed at the effects of marijuana on my eyes mixed with the onset of severe opiate withdrawals on my body, slowly turning into a broken slinky. At the house, my sisters tried to watch Bridesmaids with me, but I passed out during the part where they got food poisoning.\\n\\nI woke up in the bed on the third floor, but I thought I must have showered with my clothes on and got right into bed at some point in the night and forgot about it. My sheets were dripping wet. I dreamed of swimming. Streaks of brown clay lined the white tile in the bathroom by the toilet, but I didn’t remember getting up before then. I snuck downstairs and stole 14 dollars out of my mom’s purse and her car keys. I guzzled half a bottle of red cough syrup even though I knew it wouldn’t do anything for me.\\n\\nAt a Chevron, the crack head riding with me jumped out to see if she could get me some brown for 14 bucks. The guys in the car had some but they wanted 40 dollars. She told me to drive to a few other places in Pigeon town and jumped out to check inside of different houses. I swerved to one last house, and while she was in the house my guts shook. My sphincter quivered. An untied leather boot turned itself around inside of me and tried to push itself through my throat before I puked up bile and red cough syrup, all over the interior of my mother’s Mercedes Benz. I opened the door and slid out of the vehicle into the street to pull down my pants. An aerosol of thin liquid sprayed the pavement and the backs of my shoes. A trickle ran down my legs, and my vomit gushed onto the pavement in the middle of the ghetto before the sun came up. This went on for a few minutes before I gave up on the woman coming back and left. She could have the 14 bucks.\\n\\nI continued to vomit on myself and didn’t even try to keep my bowels under control on the drive home. “I’m going to die. I’m going to die.” I repeated to myself between retching and the expulsion of bile from my mouth and warm liquid spreading across the seat of my pants.\\n\\nMy father met me at the front door. He knew I stole the car and some money, but most of all he knew I was going to die from this sickness if I didn’t get to the hospital. My mother drove, and my father sat with me in the back seat. They wheeled me to the ER where I talked the doctor into giving me some water. My dad told her not to give me water, and I puked it up like he said I would. Soon I was on the gurney in convulsions, in and out of consciousness.\\n\\n“I’m about to s\\*\\*\\*!” I managed to gurgle to my dad and the orderly through the vomit. The orderly and my dad hooked the back of my knees with their arms and pulled me up to slide the bedpan under me. A doctor came in and belittled me for letting them put me on so much medicine in Portland. I would have cursed him out, but it was too hard to talk and puke and convulse at the same time. He wrote an order for some dilaudid to abate the vomiting and diarrhea until I could get enough fluids to not die. I had only been home for 36 hours, but I had already stolen my mom’s car, 14 bucks from her purse, drank a half bottle of cough syrup, puked it up all over the interior of her Mercedes Benz, soiled the seats, tried to score drugs in the ghetto and was currently puking and pooping to death on a gurney at seven in the morning. This was exactly why I had not been home for the last three years.\\n\\nThey let me out before I ever had a solid stool, which my dad said was wrong, and the following week I went to visit my father’s mother, Turkey. I got a hold of some 30 milligram Oxy and needed money, so I set up a visit with Turkey. He took me to eat at Popeye’s. It had been over three years since I had seen him. His bottom eyelids hung loose from his eyeballs, and he used a cane. He was much older than I had ever known him to be. I asked him for money, and he asked me why I needed it. We both knew I was lying, but he gave me a few bucks before he left.\\n\\nMy parents could only have me home for a few weeks before they insisted that I enter a yearlong rehab called Bridge House. It was free and boasted an extremely high success rate among its graduates. I told my parents that I wasn’t using, even though I would disappear for hours and get caught lying about where I was. My sister caught me bouncing (falling asleep and waking up 40-50 times a minute, while standing) one night, and I shared a needle at one of the gas stations with a random. Seals and Croft played on the radio, and beads of sweat rolled down my cheeks. Summer breeze makes me feel fine, blowing through the jasmine in my mind.\\n\\nI knew I contracted HIV from it and went into Bridge House a few days later. In one week I smoked my carton of Camel filters and got caught up in some commotion involving a guy called Long Beach threatening to stab another client with a pair of scissors. We took off together. A few days later my mom bought me a ticket back to Portland. I don’t know what they thought I would do there, but at least I would be far away.\n",

                                                                                     \\n\\nThey say the adult brain ways approximately three pounds.\\n\\nThough, I would guess that it varies, at least slightly, from individual to individual, but I’m not sure about that. It’s crazy to think that this ugly and soggy turd made of a salty gelatin locked away inside of my skull is actually responsible for everything I think and feel. Basically, the release of chemicals and their reactions inside of it coupled with some electricity and whatever else is the source of my feelings for others, about who I am or what life means and anything else.\\n\\nPersonally, I prefer to think of it as a giant flea scratching around in there. That might seem like a strange way to picture it, but when I was a kid, my mom had this refrigerator magnet she’d gotten from the veterinarian. It was made by this flea spray company, advertising one of the new treatments they had out. And I’d also seen diagrams of the human brain by then. To me, they seemed similar. The flea’s body looks like the top half of a sphere, dome shaped almost. The brain looks the same. A flea has short legs up front and the long pair they use for jumping in the back. Brains taper into the stem by the cerebellum in the back, which sort of looks like that long pair of flea legs.\\n\\nMaybe, that’s a stretch. Maybe, that doesn’t make sense to you. It does to me, though, and the reason is because my brain seems strange and foreign in its hostility towards me, like it’s a giant insect or something.\\n\\nLike now. I saw Leticia day before yesterday. On Sunday. It’s Tuesday morning. We haven’t texted or talked or anything like that, and things were really good when we were last together. She seemed enamored by my relationship with Old Man and Tony’s family. She seemed to enjoy my company. Shoot, she’s made good on every promise to meet up with me that she’s ever made, but for some reason, I am full of dread and doubt that she’ll ever see me again. It’s like, for no reason at all, I just assume she hates me when we’re not talking.\\n\\nBut now she’s calling. I answer.\\n\\n“Hey.”\\n\\n“Randy.”\\n\\n“How are you?”\\n\\n“Good. Good.”\\n\\n“Everything okay with your family? I was worried about you. Haven’t heard from you in a while.”\\n\\n“Oh, yeah. Nothing crazy. Listen, I’m busy right now, but I wanted to call you and ask about dinner tonight.”\\n\\n“What about it?”\\n\\n“Would you be able to make it?”\\n\\n“To your house?”\\n\\n“Duh. Haha. Of course, my house.”\\n\\n“I think so. Text me the address. What time?”\\n\\n“How about… Let’s say six. Sound good?”\\n\\n“Yeah.”\\n\\nWe say our good byes. She promises to text me the address, and since I’m going to her family’s house later, I walk over to one of the cupboards in my kitchen. Open it and pull out a dose of methadone. I haven’t told you about that yet. The kid, Charlie, has gone on the methadone maintenance program, and so he likes to trade me his take homes for dope. It works for me, because methadone makes it easier to function without getting sick. You know? I can look sober on methadone. Whereas, heroin might leave me looking high or nodding out in public. It’s how I’ve managed to hide my heroin use from Leticia so far.\\n\\nAnyway, I unscrew the top and knock back the magenta colored syrup inside of it. The kid told me each one is 75 milligrams. Seems right. And after I drink some water, I light a cigarette. Put one hand on the wall. My other on my waist and stare through the window. Sometimes, I like to pretend I’m Humphrey Bogart or whoever in a black and white movie staring pensively and dramatically like that. Its just for fun. Tonight’s plans make me nervous, though. I wonder what her family is like. I wonder what they’ll think of me.\n",

                                                                              \\n\\nSo, I’m leaning over the silver railing at the park overlooking the viaduct.\\n\\nAnd waiting for Leticia. Sun is shining even though its chilly and just after noon. At the market, tourists are buying small bowls of a shrimp and sausage stir fry from a young dread locked man under a white tent. Others are buying glasses of kombucha fresh from out of the tap. An old man walks by with his dog. Another man’s pants are falling off his waist. His nose runs as he scours the pavement for cigarette butts. There are pigeons looking down from the wire like cloaked and hooded harbingers of horrible death. Seagulls flap filthy wings fighting each other to rip apart a burrito like viscera from a tinfoil carcass. Now, I am sitting on one of the benches there to smoke a cigarette, and I’m digging this brown piece of cardboard out of my pocket, so that I can begin to use this felt tipped pen I have to scrawl a few strange verses of a somewhat exaggerated and imagined desperation. \\n\\nThis is what I put down:\\n\\nI’VE BEEN THINKING LATELY.\\n\\nAND.\\n\\nMY FATHER’S WIFE CHANGED THE FABRIC SOFTENER.\\n\\n25 YEARS AGO, BACK WHEN SHE WAS STILL THE MAID. \\n\\nIT’S AN OUTSIDE CHANCE.\\n\\nBUT.  \\n\\nMAYBE MY CRIPPLING DEPRESSION.\\n\\nAND DRUG ADDICTION HAS JUST BEEN AN ALLERGY.\\n\\nTO SOME CHEMICAL IMPURITY IN THE FORMULA.\\n\\nMAYBE IF I CHANGE IT. \\n\\nI DON’T HAVE TO DIE.\\n\\nMAYBE.\\n\\nBUT.\\n\\nPROBABLY NOT. \\n\\nMy father never had another wife. It’s fictional nonsense, but the short poem seems sufficiently dark and cryptic and creepy. I like it. It could be better, but something about using all capital letters and the one-word lines and incomplete sentences with periods at the end gratifies me in a way that is hard to explain. So, I won’t try. All you need to know is that I like it well enough. Originally, the thought was to make it a long letter with details about how the fabric softener was made in Mongolia and that kind of thing, but I decided the free verse poem was better. \\n\\nAnyway, a few moments pass, and now Leticia is standing to my left and greeting me.\\n\\n“Hey, you.” She says. \\n\\n“Finally.” I blow out through my lips. “Took you long enough.”\\n\\n“Whatever, Randy.” \\n\\nLeticia rolls her eyes. We laugh. I keep good eye contact with her. It’s amazing how well she gets me. And so quickly. This only the second time we’ve ever met after making plans. She walks with me back toward the market and as we get back out to the street, I hand a stranger the piece of cardboard. He doesn’t understand. I smile back at him once she and I get up the hill a ways.     \\n\\nTowards another avenue a group of men are selling stolen bottles of alcohol and electric toothbrushes. Others gather clucking and jerking across the sidewalk, these wretched children of the plague with their picking and scratching and back alley bleeding, those who wander the streets and shake cups of change at passersby and now even at me and Leticia as we walk by them. One has woven a pizza box and other pieces of foil and trash into a sort of kilt and is wearing strange bits of plastic in his hair that look like fishing lures, and further down the street the withered brown face of a man pokes out from a pile of sleeping bags and other blankets. A woman whispers into his face that she’s going to take care of him. She has the medicine. Leticia walks closely to me. It’s quite a sight, and even I do a double take at the grimy mess and hopelessness of other human souls living like this. She doesn’t know about all the living on the street I’ve done or even the fact that I am doing and selling the same heroin that they’re doing. She doesn’t know that I am the father of this miserable mass, these black creatures stumbling across the pavement. \\n\\nA taxi is pulling off the curb across the street. I put my hand out. It pulls over, and I hold the door open for her as she gets into the back.  \n",

after I’ve flicked the orange glowing ember of the butt into the street, my breath still looks like smoke in the cold morning. I’m walking from the bus stop to room 127, the old dope dungeon. It’s only a few blocks, and as I walk, I see the silhouette of a telephone pole against the grey sky. There is a big of ivy growing on it, so that it looks as if a man is indeed hanging from it. It reminds me that if hell is a place, if it’s real, then that’s where I’m going for the things I’m doing. I put my head down and walk faster. \\n\\nOutside of the room, Sal is already waiting. He hooks his thumbs in the straps of a book bag. I’ve never seen him with one before. He smiles when he sees me and throws his head back.\\n\\n“What’s up, Junky Vonnegut?”\\n\\n“Nothing, Sal. What’s up? What’s the bag for?”\\n\\n“Came to get a grip off you this morning. Hope you got me.”\\n\\n“Wait till we get inside. Don’t say anything else out here.”\\n\\nI put the key in the lock and turn. My chest is full of dread. There are so many people in the world. There are so many places to be and so many things to do. Right now, though, I wish I was anywhere but here, doing anything other than this meeting up with anyone but Sal. Money is money, though. Life is what you make it. It really is. Unfortunately, I’ve made mine crap, even though it was everything I ever thought I wanted.\n",

\\n\\nI detoxed in the back room of Carlos’s house. It was sweaty and miserable and sleepless. A slight pocking of my skin had started in California, but now it was taking a turn for the worse. It started on my arm where the witch bit me, and I swore it was a curse he put on me. The rash itched and robbed me of sleep. It tortured me. It broke my already feeble mind. My legs and ankles visibly swelled, and three different doctors had no answer. What I determined to be a secondary staph infection created crusty lesions on my thighs that broke and wept when I lifted anything heavy. A round of sulfa-based antibiotics gave me some relief, but even if the rash wasn’t there to plague my life, there were other things breaking me inside.\\n\\nThe abrupt discontinuation of my daily heroin regimen made me feel everything my body was doing. My bones’ hard surfaces cut into my aching muscles, pulling and twisting every ligament. Instead of a spine with vertebrae, I had a stack of wooden Jenga blocks ready to fall. My guts gurgled when I swallowed my saliva. I imagined my brain’s synaptic firings discharged heat through my ears and caused a dull aching in my eyeballs. It was as if life had become an electrically charged fence into which I was slowly being pushed. \\n\\nMy feet shuffled across the floor in the daytime. Articles of clothing I collected from the streets covered Carlos’s back room in truly psychotic fashion. I spilled rolling tobacco all over his house and crept around the kitchen at night. His cupboard’s hinges creaked while his family slept. Solidified chunks from an ancient can of Ensure stuck between my teeth, and I gagged. It was my fault for compulsively looting his dry goods cabinet and eating whatever I found in the dark. \n",

Doh-Doh. With tears in his eyes, he told me of entertaining back when he was Turtle Tom Stone and made crowds swoon.  He told me that every time he died from an overdose and went to heaven some “Abe Lincoln looking mother f\\*cker” sent him back saying he had to come in the front. That he couldn’t come in the back door.\\n\\nTurtle said he once woke up in a refrigerated room under a sheet of plastic. His clothes sat in a bag on his feet and he had a toe tag. He got dressed and found dope hidden in his waistband. The whole hospital was frantically searching for his missing body, while he snorted drugs in a bathroom stall. His friends already had all his stuff and were squatting in his apartment when he walked up. A soothsayer in NY state had told him this was his last incarnation and that he was paying the price for the evil of his past lives.  These were the stories he told me.\\n\\nOne day he watched our friend’s girlfriend open his window and hang her belly over the sill before she slid onto the floor. The lights were off and she supposed he was gone, but Tom watched the whole thing from his bed a few feet away. She came for the flat screen. Tom slapped her in the head with his cane and used his walker to escort her to the front door. That was New Mexico when I knew it. Your friends robbed you and talked bad about you when it didn’t work out for them. Tom sent me to the bank to pull 40 bucks out of the ATM and get some cocaine one night, but I took $300 out of his account and never came back. The year’s last snow had still not melted.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \\n\\nI am open for business, now. Customers show up one by one. These are the faithful.  They practice a chemical religion and daily make this solemn faced pilgrimage, seeking absolution from me, their priest, in this stinking room as if it were some sweaty confessional where their souls might be saved. There is no crucifix made of metal on the wall, just the icon of a cold, dirty pistol under the bed. Sometimes, I feel the power of it all. Like I’m holding this throttle of evil power, and I let it open till nothing’s held back. Then, sometimes, I can see it for what it really is, and all that it will cost me, like my life is just a black and whispering vein pumping misery through this black creature called time. \\n\\nI’m feeling kind of bad, thinking about all of it, but eventually, Peanut Boy comes by with Barbie. They usually get a gram or two. They always make me laugh, too. A large black man comes in after they leave. He talks, thinks and has all the affectations of a mentally disturbed and heroin addicted teenage girl, like he is legitimately a young female stuck in this huge man’s body. The man buys his and is gone. A transexual, who Eddie calls ‘Shoelace,’ shows up from her room across the parking lot with grease clots in her skin and stubbly scabbed patches of beard shaped like countries on a map I’ve never seen. She tries to lure me back to her room with a piece of banana Laffy Taffy every time I see her. I turn her down this morning. I always do. \\n\\nEddie is in and out, but I’m always giving him his daily amount to work out of and he gives me the cash for whatever I gave him the day before. It’s usually a half ounce for him. Other bicycle and flashlight people come in for smaller amounts. They wear three or four hoodies one on top of the other. Some carry worn trunks full of broken things or wrap themselves in headphone cords and duct tape. I usually only sit here until 12 and let Eddie handle the business from his room after that, but in the five hours or whatever it is I usually sit here, I make anywhere between 700 to 1500 dollars. That’s every day and not counting Eddie or the people who get quantity like Sharky or Cheese or Martin from me after I’m done here. \\n\\nMy old friend Wendy shows up. We met when I was coming back up after that stint in California I’ve told you about and got lost in north Oregon for a few months. I had five pounds of frozen fish sticks which I was looking to sell, but I was walking by these food carts, so I get distracted by this great idea. It was that there might be a propane cannister I could steal and return for the deposit, so I stepped through the bushes to look. Instead, I found this guy jabbering at Wendy in the morning light next to a puddle of blood and what appeared to be three or four stolen bikes all disassembled into their smallest pieces and scattered across the pavement. They both looked like they’d spent the whole night licking their lips off. \\n\\nAnyway, that evening I talked her into buying a pack of cigarettes and smoked them while she was sleeping. Back then, she had a boy’s haircut and claimed to be a lesbian but let me hold her hand and shared her red sleeping bag with me until she vomited all over it on Burnside a few days later. We gave up and hitchhiked back up here after that. Once she got to town, some dramatic scenario left her with two badly broken legs. I think a car hit her or someone threw her out of a second story window. Something like that. Wendy doesn’t talk about it, and I can’t remember. Either way, she ended up in the wheelchair. It was only supposed to be temporary. Maybe a few months. She got used to it, though, and never got back out of it. It’s been over nine years.\\n\\nAfter I help roll her backwards into the room, I look down at her and smile.\\n\\n“Wow! It’s good to see you Wendy. Too wild. Who’d’ve thought?”\\n\\n“Yeah. I heard this was the place to come these days, but the guy only worked from dawn to noon every day.”\\n\\n“Well, there’s always Ed down the way. Just a few rooms over. He can always take care of you.”\\n\\n“I’ve seen him a few times. He’s the one who told me. You know how I am, though, Randy! I want to meet the head honcho. Always have.”\\n\\n“That’s true.”\\n\\n“Something told me I was about to run into you.” Wendy claims to be psychic or clairvoyant, but just slightly. It’s hard for me to believe that kind of thing. She always says she’s had a premonition after the fact.\\n\\n“Really? Well, here I am.”\\n\\n“Yes. You are. Remember when I used to be your look out?” \\n\\n“Oh man!”\\n\\n“I know. Look at you now, kid. You’ve come a long way. You’re a big shot, now.”\\n\\n“Guess I am. Guess I am.”\\n\\n“Well, how do ya feel?”\\n\\n“I don’t know. The same, I guess.”\\n\\nI give her a gift and we talk for a while. She tells me about life on the streets and what that’s like for her these days and about some charges she’d caught. When I look at my phone it says that it’s a quarter to noon and I fidget a bit while she talks. Finally, I tell her that I have to get going, so we hug and say our goodbyes, but as I help her out of the door, Sal is standing outside. He looks like he’s been standing there a while and waiting. Wendy gives me a worried look when she sees him.\\n\\n“What’s up Junky Vonnegut?” It sounds like a cold accusation. We never meet here anymore. It’s always at Dee Dee’s mom’s place. \\n\\n“Sup, Sal?”\\n\\n“Nothing man. Just came by looking for a little bit bigger piece than usual.” He usually only gets a couple grams at the most. \\n\\n“Yeah. I think I can do that for you. This is Wendy. She was just leaving.”\\n\\n“Yeah. Gotta get going. See you. Remember what I said, Randy. Be careful.” She never said anything about being careful.\\n\\n“Okay. See you, Wen.” I say and hug her, again. I turn to Sal. We walk in together. “What were you with Sharky for last night?”\\n\\n“Oh, man. You know. Just doing our thing, bro. We’ve been working hard out here. Got some bigger clients now. That’s why we got what we got last night and gotta get this issue right here.”\\n\\n“I didn’t know you guys were that tight.”\\n\\n“Yeah. Man. What? You think I’d just drop some stranger off in your lap like that, man? Not me!”\\n\\n“I just didn’t know. What you looking for?”\\n\\n“I need a zip.”\\n\\n“An ounce?”\\n\\n“Yeah.”\\n\\n“Okay.”\\n\\nI sit down and get the scale out and weigh one out for him out of the bag I just got from Old Man earlier this morning. Sal holds it up and studies it. He laughs.\\n\\n“Nice, man. Real nice.”\\n\\n“Yeah.”\\n\\n“Well, I gotta get out of here. Hit me up later. Or I’ll hit you up.”\\n\\nWe bump knuckles. He slams the door. I head back to the apartment, but before I can get to the street, my mind slips away from me for a minute. It falls into another one of its fevered imaginations. Several homeless addicts limp toward me in the murk and gloom of the parking lot fog, like war wounded victims stuck in the smoke of some fiery apocalypse. They don’t speak, but I can tell they want to buy. I wave them off. One snaps like a dog, and another laughs. More of them appear out of the fog, like images of dark, afflicted figures visiting me from the mist or lost angels forming themselves out of nothing and disappearing back into the ether from which they coalesced. \\n\\nNow, I am stepping off the curb. A sick tree’s roots suck dust and rock at my feet between the pavement. In the distance where it is harder to see there is a pair of women. They pick through the trash like rubble. They cry and pull out their hair. Slaves from the time of some black emperor. This is too much for me today. It’s time for me to get back to the apartment and get mine, to numb myself from the horror of this hell with the very thing that has brought it into my life. \\n\\nHeroin.\\n\\n41\\n\\nI have this dream sometimes.\\n\\nThat my life is this weird sitcom that plays on network television every Thursday night. It’s a national favorite. I star as the red headed, only child of the family, sort of a spoof of Beaver Cleaver or Dennis the Menace or something like that. Canned laugher plays after everything I say and do in the dream. There are different sounds and music that cue any time my dad or mom come into my room. They are still married on the show, even though they sleep in different beds. My uncle Benny is the angry neighbor.  My grandmother makes a guest appearance as an old rescue from the pound in a two-part episode. I get stuck in a well, and she saves me. The second installment has the highest ratings of any show in the history of all the networks in my dreamland. A car hits her and kills her before the next episode airs. It’s how they write her off the show.   \\n\\nBut for the rest of the week, when no one is watching, I see what everyone does behind the scenes. There is no laughter. There is no music. No one ever breaks character, but they show their true colors. My mother is really having an affair with my uncle. Both of them are evil. I can never find my dad in the maze of facades and props. Anyway, halfway through the second season, the producers get rid of me. There are some issues with my brain, so they bring in an older boy with brown hair to replace me. \\n\\nFor the rest of the dream, I’m stuck in this dark room watching marathons of the show. The theme song still plays. The laughter continues. The plots unfold, and credits roll. Then another episode starts, and my replacement gets the laughs and love that belong to me. No one even notices it’s someone else playing my part. They don’t care. My replacement looks right into the camera after every joke, because he knows I’m watching. I cry. I yell at the TV.           \\n\\nAnd that’s never a fun one to wake up from, because the residual feelings are so heavy, but that’s how I wake up this afternoon. It’s Thursday. Sometime around three. I reupped with Old Man this morning for the first time since Sunday when he invited me to his daughter’s birthday party. My work at room 127 of the Lindell Motel went well. The kid, Charlie, hasn’t been back since he left with Sharky and Sal that night. His ex-sister-in-law has introduced me to four other strippers, though, and her boyfriend. They all buy from me now. I’ve been back to the strip joint where she works every night to sell to them, but I haven’t seen Breezy. That’s okay, though. Tonight’s the night we’re supposed to meet by the Seattle wheel. Tonight’s the night she’ll be dressed in white. At least, that’s what she said. \\n\\n The building has good heating systems. My apartment feels great. Grey clouds sit over the city. There are droplets of drizzle sprinkled on the window. I sit on the couch for a minute, still waking up. I pinch the bridge of my nose and use my thumb and finger to work the white bacon bits from my eyes. There is little in life as satisfying as removing the crusted buildup of your own bodily excretions from your body. It’s nice sitting here in the warm afterglow of the hit I did earlier. The altoid can sits on the coffee table in front of me. My spoon and syringe are next to it. There is my ashtray full of crumpled butts. I think about doing another hit, but it’s probably not a good idea if I’m going to meet this girl in a few hours. Better hold off, and I do. No one has called. No messages on my phone.\\n\\nI walk down to the street and grab a coffee from a store on the corner. Days like these are my favorite to walk around in. It’s cold and grey and drizzling. Something about it makes you feel like your insides are a warm home with a fire burning and family talking about their days. Maybe that doesn’t make sense, but it does to me. That’s how it makes me feel stepping around puddles in a dismal Pacific Northwest day like this. Besides, the coffee is warmer and tastier in contrast to the elements, and another block down, I step into a thrift store. It is full of dead people’s things and the physical evidence of forgotten childhoods. Worn blackened tennis shoes of every size lie on top of an old table. There are a few bikes. One has training wheels. An old hospital bed hides behind some old dressers and a few desks and a teddy bear with its eye missing watches me from the checkout counter. Tangles of wires and out dated electronics hang from a shelf. Bed frames and a few mattresses lean against the back wall. Most of the floor space is a stifling maze of clothes racks. It all has that smell of old mothballs and sloughed, dead skin cells stuck in the worn cotton. An old woman digs through the racks like she’s lost something or someone and doesn’t know what else to do with the remainder of her life but wholly devote herself to searching the secondhand merchandise. It reminds me of my grandmother in a way. It makes me want to hug her and tell her I love her, that we’re going to be okay, that she isn’t alone. In my imagination we cry big tears in each other’s arms. My lip quivers. My face flushes. I walk out of the store. \n",

He slams the door. I head back to the apartment, but before I can get to the street, I find myself walking through another nightmare scene in the city. I move through these cold clouds in the parking lot. Several homeless addicts are moving towards me in the murk and gloom, like war wounded victims stuck in the smoke of some fiery apocalypse. They don’t speak, but I can tell they want to buy. I wave them off. One snaps like a dog, and another laughs. More of them appear out of the fog, like images of dark, afflicted figures visiting me from the mist or lost angels forming themselves out of nothing and disappearing back into the ether from which they coalesced. Now, I am stepping off the curb. Sick tree roots suck dust and rock at my feet between the pavement. In the distance where it is harder to see there is a pair of women digging in the trash like rubble. They cry and pull their hair. Slaves from the time of the black emperor. My mind slips sometimes like this. It is too much for me today. It’s time for me to get back to the apartment and get mine, to numb myself from the horror of this hell with the very thing that has brought it into my life. Heroin.\n",

motel room.\\n\\nBut I get off a few blocks up from the stop that’s closest to it, so I can get something to eat at McDonald’s. When I get up to the counter a pretty girl takes my order which is for two sausage biscuits, a small orange juice and a cup of coffee. She puts a tray on the counter and my food and drinks on top of it. I ask for a few packets of grape jelly, because sausage biscuits with grape jelly are my favorite to eat for breakfast, and so I go sit at a table over in the corner and open the wrappers of the sandwiches and put jelly on them and then squirt the other packet onto the paper so I can dip the sausage biscuits right into some extra jelly. They really are my favorite thing to eat for breakfast. One time, when I was starving and homeless on the street, this guy woke me up with a five-dollar bill and gave me a few cigarettes. I’d been sleeping under the overhang of a strip mall in front of a nail salon. It was raining. Instead of using that money for another pack of cigarettes or waiting to get another few bucks to go in on a bag with someone so that I could get well, I walked directly to McDonald’s to buy and eat five sausage biscuits with grape jelly in a row. \\n\\nSo, I’m sitting there scarfing my food the way I always do so that I can barely even breathe and choke on it once or twice between slurping at the orange juice. It’s still dark outside. Traffic is slow to move on Sunday mornings like this, but eventually it’ll take off. The sky has a few violet veins of what look to be promises of daylight running through the clouds, and across from me at another table a woman holds her cup of coffee in a pair of dirty skeleton hands. She wears a purple hoodie that’s in good condition, but a little dirty. I can tell she’s homeless and high. There’s that blissful crimp of her lips on her face and the pin pricked pupils that heroin gives people. For me it’s easy to see. It’s like an aura of warm glamour shot fuzz that she wears, and I can see. The lady is pretty, still in her early 40s I would guess with big eyes and no wrinkles but the obvious wear and tear of life on drugs and the streets. The fact that she’s high so early in the day means that she’s got something figured out. When I was on the streets, I was always sick in the morning and had to hit licks to come up for the day. But, then again, girls fair better than men in that regard out here. They have what is arguably the most sought-after commodity in the history of the world, but it’s not fun living like that however good the drugs feel. It all comes at a heavy price.  \\n\\nAfter eating I make it up to the old trap motel room, number 127 at the Lindell Motor Lodge. It stinks as badly as it ever did, so I hear. I can’t tell, though. That’s just what the customers say. The gun I bought when I first started selling and living here lives under the bed. It just doesn’t feel necessary for me to be toting that thing around everywhere I go. I still want to have it. I just don’t want to have it with me, so I leave it here. Makes me feel better. Even if it doesn’t make sense.\\n\\nCustomers show up one by one. Peanut Boy comes by with Barbie. Eddie is in and out every morning, but I’m always giving him his daily amount to work out of and he gives me the cash for whatever I gave him the day before. Other bicycle and flashlight people come in for smaller amounts. I usually only sit there until 12 and let Eddie handle the business from his room after that, but in the five hours or whatever it is I usually sit there, I make anywhere between 700 to 1500 dollars. That’s every day and not counting the people who get quantity like Sharky or Cheese or even Martin from me after I’m done here. Sal shows up at nine or so and walks right in. I always meet him at Dee Dee’s place. Never here. \\n\\n“What’s up Junky Vonnegut?” The way he says it isn’t even the same.\\n\\n“Sup, Sal?”\\n\\n“Nothing man. Just came by looking for a little bit bigger piece than usual.” He usually only gets a couple grams at the most. \\n\\n“Yeah. I think I can do that for you. What were you with Sharky for last night?”\\n\\n“Oh, man. You know. Just doing our thing, bro. We’ve been working hard out here. Got some bigger clients now. That’s why we got what we got last night and gotta get this issue right here.”\\n\\n“I didn’t know you guys were that tight.”\\n\\n“Yeah. Man. What? You think I’d just drop some stranger off in your lap like that, man? Not me!”\\n\\n“I just didn’t know. What you looking for?”\\n\\n“I need a zip.”\\n\\n“An ounce?”\\n\\n“Yeah.”\\n\\n“Okay.”\\n\\nI get the scale out and weigh one out for him out of the bag I just got from Old Man earlier this morning. Sal holds it up and studies it. He laughs.\\n\\n“Nice, man. Real nice.”\\n\\n“Yeah.”\\n\\n“Well, I gotta bust out of here. Hit me up later. Or I’ll hit you up.”\\n\\nWe bump knuckles. He slams the door. I finish out my little trap shift and head back to the apartment. It’s time for me to get mine and nod out for a bit. \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Sometimes I sat on the park block benches in a cold, gray drizzle. A stranger might hand me a grease stained box half filled with some unidentifiable sludge and a chunk of what was alleged to be chicken breast, or I might beat out the last bit of my peach yogurt onto my blackened palm before licking it up unashamed and starving for passersby to see.\\n\\nOther times I had spells of de ja vu like I had seen these very same things in the same order in a dream a long time ago, or maybe it was the effect of living the same reality over and over again as the universe exploded out of nothing and created everything before it imploded in on itself and did it again.\\n\\nOne time I sat back after dinner in a soup kitchen, and tears streamed down the faces of two girls singing worship songs at the homeless shelter. They sang, “You give and take away. You give and take away.” The theology struck me as odd, but I appreciated the passion before their friend came out to give his testimony of being a depressed teenager who found life and joy in Jesus Christ. I thought that sounded nice but didn’t apply to me. There were holes in my arms that had to be filled, and I regarded nothing as sacred.\\n\\nAnd another time I met a 54-year-old woman named Donna squatting against the wall next to me out of the rain and smoking a cigarette. She wore funeral parlor perfume that seemed to be mingled with the aromas of mental illness and mildew. Her mascara ran in the rain, and flecks of red lipstick stuck to her teeth. She bit her cigarette. She punched me in the shoulder. She pointed her finger.\\n\\n“Look at that!” A dramatic scene unfolded 60 feet from where we crouched. EMTs rolled a blue lipped and grey faced person in a gurney out of Fred Meyer’s and into the back of the ambulance. I couldn’t tell if the person was a man or a woman. I just knew they were ugly.\\n\\n“Who’s that?”\\n\\n“Jerianne. I guess she’s not coming back to the apartment with me this afternoon. Bahaha. Screwed it up? Didn’t ya, Jerianne? She always does!” She threw the rest of her cigarette into a puddle. “You wanna come home with me?”\\n\\nWe walked west a few blocks and took a left up a steep hill to her apartment where she told me about how perverted the attendant at the corner gas station was and then let me crawl all over her in the dark. Afterwards we smoked cigarettes and talked in bed.\\n\\n“My son died 4 years ago in a car accident on the coast in Washington. He was everything to me. He was all I had. I tried to kill myself last month with my methadone and colonopin but it didn’t work. I took my whole month’s worth of methadone and my colonopin too, but I woke up in the morning. The doctors filled my scripts again but now I have to take classes three days a week for the nine more months, and I still wish I was dead.”\\n\\nThat’s life though. One morning you’re on your knees kissing your pregnant wife’s belly and buying diapers and rolling out pink paint on the walls of the room with the crib for the baby girl you’ll be bringing home any day now, but the next morning you’re on your knees in a hospital waiting room clutching your face and screaming with blood on your shirt and trying to understand why. It happens. People lose their most precious relationships in an instant, and there’s nothing they can do about it but die themselves. She chose a slow death and hurt all along the way.\\n\\nWe rented movies from the library and watched them over and over without ever knowing what they were about, because we snored through them. Anything filmed in the early 90s invoked strong feelings for me, because they were from when I was a kid, before the hatred consummated within. I dreamed of living the life of one of the unnamed extras and disappearing into the fictitious background of Lethal Weapon 2 or Backdraft where life was of no consequence and Michael Jordan was winning championships in Chicago. It was not uncommon for her to wake up with large holes burnt into her sheets from nodding out with lit cigarettes.\\n\\n“Did I set my bed on fire last night? I think I remember that! Haha! Yeah. Now I remember. I woke up and the sheets were on fire. There was a fire last night! Yup. Sure was. Jeesh! You’d think that I’d remember something like that. Haha! Almost burned myself up in a fire and the whole building too. Haha!”\\n\\nIn the daytime, she helped me boost merchandise from stores, but I was good at it even without her. I strategized to either be in and out as quickly as possible, or if I thought a secret shopper was following me, I would walk from one side of the store up an aisle back to the other side, and down another aisle, and back up it. If anyone followed me for all of that, I would ask him why he was following me. They never knew what to say. If they were on the phone, I would ask them to say hello to their mothers for me. If they were in the health food section, I asked what a tub of lard like them was doing buying raw organic almonds. Sometimes, I would fill a hand basket and get their attention by walking toward the door and drop it, right before I walked out. Then, while they put the items back or talked to each other about it in the room full of monitors, I would walk back through the store and steal what I wanted. Donna kept lookout, and I filled my bags with DVDs and walked out with my arms full of merchandise and the alarms going off.\\n\\nShe kicked me out one morning after I got high and slept on the couch. A few days after that I got high on meth and texted her from under a dumpster about her naked 54-year-old body and what I wanted to do it. She forwarded the explicit messages along with her own haranguing texts to my mother every day for weeks. My mom told me that Donna sent 28 texts before noon on a Tuesday, and none of them made any sense.\\n\\nIn late May I found a cup of cold coffee in a trashcan and threw it on her downtown. She called the cops and tried to tell them I was a thief, which they already knew but couldn’t take me to jail on. It was in Pioneer Square where I used to sit and wait for licks or plant my feet in one spot with straight legs and fold at the waist like a taco trying to touch my nose to my big toe and drooling. People always stopped and woke me up to ask if I was okay or if I needed some help, but I was doing great.\\n\\nI moved for work after that and came the city to pick up from this girl I met. Her name was Breezy, and it was good to have a steady hook up even if it meant riding the bus two hours out to he place and two hours back to where I slept every night. I did day labor and slept under the awning of a nail salon across the street. At four I woke up to catch rides with the crew out to the landfill where we worked. The guy who drove had the aura of a potato. He wore a leather jacket. He drove a truck. He grew a bushy beard. He mumbled something about alimony payments and a daughter on our cigarette break once, but when I pictured him going home to his sad life, he was a potato, a soft, lumpy potato crying on his pillow. After a few weeks, the company fired me for stealing other people’s lunches and sleeping in the bushes while on the clock, but I tried to make life in Vancouver work anyway. I didn’t give up until the incident in which a local army veteran paid me five dollars and a 99-cent cheeseburger to deposit a certain bodily fluid on a lacy pair of panties in a graveyard. Then I moved back to the city.\\n\\nOn a Saturday night, a stumbling and drunk Mexican flashed the money in his wallet at me by Voodoo doughnuts. He wanted me to be his date or sex or something, but it ended up that he spent about five minutes licking the side of my face while I got his wallet out of his back pocket and took the money. It was a 200-dollar come up, and I skipped around town until I pulled my money out to buy crack from a big group of black men in China town. They jumped me badly and robbed me.\\n\\nAs Sunday morning broke the splatter of cold rain on the sidewalk soaked into my newspaper blankets under a Chinatown stoop. I couldn’t sleep, and the loss of the 200 dollars was my only thought. My leg and hip hurt from getting jumped. It had been such a happy moment to have that money in my pocket for the morning, but I called Breezy anyway and appealed to her compassion. She told me to come see her in an apartment downtown where she was getting tattooed.\\n\\nIn the room, Breezy and her 19 year old girlfriend laid face down to get lace tattooed down the back of their legs. It was an ordeal, and they squirmed and squealed. The lady whose place it was kept talking to her dead girlfriend like she was floating in the room with us, and their tattoo artist asked if he should start a mobile tattoo business even though it was illegal. Breezy gave me a hit to hold me over, and we hung out for a while before I left.\\n\\nI bought from her a lot, because she was reliable and always holding and generous. She fronted or gave me dope, because she liked me. It wasn’t long after we met that I came to see her at her hotel room to find her jerking around her room collecting some belongings in a bag and sweating in a curly blonde wig.\\n\\n“Here you go. Can you watch my place for me? Some f***ing scumbag tried to rob me earlier. I need someone here if he tries to come back.” She handed me a few chunks of heroin and meth. Maybe she had reason to think the place was about to get raided and wouldn’t mind if I took the fall.\\n\\n“Yeah, I can watch the place.”\\n\\n“I don’t know why, but I trust you. I’ll be back tomorrow.” Her girlfriend wasn’t around. She was with a guy, and they took off in a truck. Later, she used this incident to make me feel special and said,\\n\\n“You are special. I never trust people like that, but I knew you were different from the start.”\\n\\nIt took her a day or so to come back, and we got close when she did. Breezy chased her 19-year-old girlfriend off for being paranoid and jealous, before she moved on to the next fling. I texted Danielle back in Cincinatti even though she was with another guy, and I complained about my heartache to Breezy. Breezy asked me if I thought she liked to hear about Danielle.\\n\\nBreezy would finally fall asleep at around 4 a.m. Sometimes earlier, but when she was out she could not be woken up. Slapping her didn’t work. Screaming was useless. We never tried pouring cold water, but it seemed doubtful that it would make any difference. It was a problem, because people wanted to buy 24/7. Most nights before she fell asleep she would send me and whoever was around with money for cigarettes, scratch tickets, grape red vines, fun dip, sour patch explodes, donuts and apple fritters which were her favorite. She filled the grape licorice with the sugar from the fun dip and handed them out like the loaded syringes she handed out earlier in the day. Then she would pass out and wake up in the morning raging and throwing things.\\n\\nShe gave me five balloons of heroine one morning and sent me to sell them downtown, but before I took off with my bag and a long board Breezy pulled out a huge bottle of random pills from which I took three. I had not slept or eaten in days, and she sent me off ten minutes later with a sweaty peck on the cheek and aggravated by how badly I was slurring my words.\\n\\nAt the Nordstram Rack I packed as many bottles of cologne into my black book bag and some fabric grocery bags I had, even though I could see stout men with earpieces watching me through the glass doors. It was the 4th time I had been there to rob the place of cologne in 2 weeks, and it was also obvious that the men were part of a sting operation set up to stop me. I kept going anyway and juggled the 5 heroine balloons in my mouth with my tongue on the way out. As soon as the door opened, a voice screamed,\\n\\n“STOP RIGHT THERE!!!!”\\n\\nI bolted down the street after a woman scratched my neck, and I punched her. She chased me and screamed for someone to stop me. A man with long hair grabbed my backpack, and 3 yellow balloons fell out of my mouth and onto the sidewalk. I broke free and skated to some festival at the park by the river. There were cops looking for me, so I took off my hat and jacket, hid the skateboard under a bridge and walked around talking to strangers. Cop cars drove by every 30 seconds looking for someone but never stopped me.\\n\\nLater I did the two balloons I had in my mouth, and after a few hours I went to see if the other balloons were still on the ground. They were, and I sold one and did the rest of them under a bridge as night fell, because I wasn’t going back to the hotel. I told Breezy that I messed it all up when she called, and she cried,\\n\\n“Come back. I don’t care. It doesn’t matter to me. I want you back here. You are too important to me.”\\n\\nThe days at Breezy’s went by hot and slow. It was June, and it seemed like everyone was in and out all day everyday. We never had time together, and I could tell she wanted to get me alone. The place finally cleared out one afternoon, and I said,\\n\\n“I’m leaving, too,” to scavenge for something to trade her for more drugs.\\n\\n“Why would you leave now? Huh? Everyone finally left us alone and now you want to leave? What’s wrong with you?” Desperation and hurt squeezed through her voice box from across the room.\\n\\n“Oh. I didn’t know you wanted me to stay.” I knew she wanted to have sex with me, and I felt the same, mostly from the drugs and the weird bio chemical things that happen when a boy and girl spend too much time together. “I’m here, then.” She put her legs up on the table, and we both grimaced at a bad smell in the room.\\n\\n“I’m going to take a shower.”\\n\\nShe told everyone about it. Her friend, Gay Kevin, told me she said it was the best she had in a long time, and I was proud of myself. But as the days continued the meth overrode the heroin, and I never slept except the time she made me and I spilled water all over her in the bed. She laughed about it and changed the sheets, but she could be really mean too, like when I repeated myself.\\n\\n“Yeah, I know, Riley. You already said that. Try saying something different. I’m tired of hearing the same old s*** from you all the time.” But, she was kind to me about the water I spilled on her. When I needed a haircut, she sat me down in the kitchen and cut it. She did a good job, too. I kept shaved for her because that’s what she liked.\\n\\n“Thanks for the hit, baby.”\\n\\n“Riley?”\\n\\n“Yeah, baby?”\\n\\n“Don’t call me baby. That’s not my f***ing name!” I pretended I never heard it and referred to her as babes within a half hour.\\n\\nI stalked up and down the road in the June sun, Quasimodo’s skeleton sweating and scheming all day, marching back and forth to the department store. Someone told me shooting up in the thin veins in my wrists was the most likely place to kill me with a clot. I didn’t know if it was true, but I shot up there just in case. Everyone told me the same thing, “You don’t need a gun, Riley. Armed robbery is not worth it.” But it was more about putting a bullet in the ceiling, jumping onto the counter and screaming for everyone to get on the ground. It was my new obsession but no one would give me a gun. I fantasized armed robbery in Breezy’s kitchen and sweated listening for cars through the blinds.\\n\\nShe punched me in the face one night for trying to defend myself against some grievance one of her ex-girlfriends had against me. It was getting more and more difficult to be there, and it seemed like she hated me. One night she had sex with several guys right in front of me and wouldn’t even look at me when I talked to her afterwards. I kept trying to get her attention, but Gay Kevin said,\\n\\n“Let it alone. She don’t want to talk to you right now.” He knew her better than I did, but I tried to grab her bags of meth and heroine to insult her. She hid the dope under her butt and told me to leave. As I made my way towards the door, one of the guys she slept with screamed obscenities and threats of stabbing me from the bathroom.\\n\\nI’ve always heard that Roosevelt said, “Speak softly and carry a big stick.” I ran my mouth and when that didn’t work I used whatever I could to impose my will and destroy things. In this case it happened to be the wooden bat she kept by the door. I jumped over the bed and almost kicked the pocket door down before I pulled him out by his hair and drove the bat like a splitting maul to his head. It connected on the side of his skull behind his ear. He crumpled to the ground.\\n\\nBreezy jumped onto my back, so I reached behind her head and hooked her armpit to body slam her onto the floor. She gasped as the wind knocked out of her. Gay Kevin charged me but bounced off me and went to the ground like an empty Styrofoam cup in the wind, and we spent the next few minutes in a tornado of random objects flying around the room. I launched Breezy backwards through the air with my legs. The blinds came down with her, and she moaned like she might be seriously hurt. The men shook in fear as I backed towards the door and grabbed a sleeping back on my way out. My stay there was up, and the cops were coming.\\n\\nIn a room of what were supposed to be hardened criminals, violent types, people to be feared I was the only one living up to my persona and the things I said. Everyone bluffed and lied about the danger they presented, but like a poker game I laid down four aces almost every time the chips were on the table. They all had nothing in their hands, and you can’t win with nothing when your bluff is called. It wasn’t that I was tough or bad. If anything I was a coward and selfish and stupid most of all, but I had soaked up everything I ever saw or heard since I was little like a sponge. I adapted and thrived in any environment that didn’t kill me. My environments were criminal and my life was violent, so that’s what I was good at.\\n\\nThe sirens wailed in the distance. There was a boarded up strip club a block away where I hid in the bushes behind it with my sleeping bag. I went back into town the next morning and never saw Breezy again.\\n\\n\n",

32\\n\\nI throw the keys onto the counter by the red spiral notebook where I write my stories.\\n\\nThe kid sees it and picks it up, the way a child would and asks,\\n\\n“What’s this?”\\n\\n“A notebook.”\\n\\n“I see that. I mean, what’s in it?”\\n\\n“Things I write.”\\n\\n“You write?”\\n\\n“I guess. I try to.”\\n\\n“Like what?”\\n\\n“I don’t know. I just have stupid ideas, and they make me laugh, so I write them down.”\\n\\n“Like?”\\n\\n“They’re stupid. You wouldn’t like them.”\\n\\n“I bet not. Try me. What’s one about?” A droplet of clear water snot runs from his nostril and over his lip into his mouth. He tries to suck it back into his nose with a deep inhalation.\\n\\n“Well…,” I hold my hands out in front of my face like I’m grasping at some nebulous reality only I can see and trying to sculpt it like clay or weave it like yarn or pull it out of the ether and manifest it as the story I’m telling. “Well, I have one about a boy who has a love affair with a Safeway sign.”\\n\\n“A Safeway sign?”\\n\\n“Yeah. He wanders the hills of a dark city, lost and destitute. From the distance he looks to the sign as some sort of Alpha and Omega…”\\n\\n“Alpha and Omega?” He asks.\\n\\n“Yeah. You know? The first and the last. The beginning and the end. That which contains all within itself and is all from start to finish. Anyway, for him it’s as if all of creation has been poured out from that beacon of light and hope and like an Alabama beetle he is drawn to her. He loves the sign.”\\n\\n“Her?”\\n\\n“Yeah. The sign.”\\n\\n“Sheesh. Sounds stupid.”\\n\\n“See. I told ya.”\\n\\n“Well, I mean, dude, I didn’t know you were gonna tell me you were writing stories about lost boys falling in love with Safeway signs.”\\n\\n“But I told you that you’d think it was stupid.”\\n\\n“Yeah. You did. What else you got?”\\n\\n“I got one about a dude named Clyde who goes by Boom Boom and his friend Rufus Cumberbutt. They’re homeless junkies in the streets and have all these wild antics. Basically, there’s an ex-pimp who was named Joseph Junior who got acid thrown in his face and is inhabited by an evil entity. They call him The Faceless One. Rufus turns out to be his son, and when things get crazy, Boom Boom moves back to his aunt’s in Ohio to try to get sober but ends up moving in with a crazy, Apache princess named Gabriella. They are together until Boom Boom gets tired of her doing all of his dope and screwing him over. He sells her to some Hattians on the Gulf Coast.”\\n\\n“Wow. Sounds like something I might could read.”\\n\\n“Yeah. It’s okay. Kinda silly, though, too.”\\n\\n“So, what’s up? Where’s that good good? If you want, I can call my mom and see if she’ll let me have a few bucks to make it 20 even.”\\n\\n“Hold on.” I run to the bathroom, where I have my personal stash. The way he talked about his mom helping him out hit some strange place in me and has sent me into a fit of convulsions as I struggle to choke back my sobs. I’m not sure why, but it hits me hard. These tears are hard to hold back and to keep silent, I muffle the intensity of the sadness and desire to cry in the back of my throat. It burns. My face is red and splotchy, and the words of my mother come back to me.\\n\\n“You’re an ugly crier.”\\n\\nThe kid is banging on the door. I keep my personal in an old Altoid’s can and pinch a nice pebble of the dope in my fingers. He’s staring at me when I open the door.\\n\\n“You alright? Took you long enough.”\\n\\n“Yeah. Sure. I’m fine. Here.”\\n\\nI hold my fingers out. He fumbles. He slaps his pockets looking for a spoon or something suitable to contain the powder I’ve hot in my fingers. After a moment, he produces a tin cooker.\\n\\n“Dude, don’t hold it like that. Don’t you know that your body heat eats it up, besides think of all the dope you’re getting stuck to your fingers and wasting.”\\n\\n“I’m not worried about it.”\\n\\n“Bro. This is the same stuff I was telling you about. The Vonnegut stuff.”\\n\\n“I know.”\\n\\nIt takes him a minute, but eventually he looks at me. “Are you?”\\n\\n\n",

right in front of my door.\\n\\nThe wipers move lazily. Water droplets bead the window and slide down the exterior of the car. Exhaust blows out the tailpipe. Beth and Sal are screaming so loudly it can be heard through the rolled-up windows which makes me not want to get in, but it’s the only way to move up in the game. \\n\\nI go back into my room and get on my belly to reach under the bed and grab that dirty piece of steel under there. Again, it is cold against my stomach and heavy in my waistband. The gun makes me miserable, just having it, and as I turn to lock the door on the way out, the neighbor lady’s door is opened. She still wears the black garbage bag for a skirt but this time with no top. From the dark insides of her room, she asks me to tell Hank that she loves him and cries on her bed.\\n\\n“Okay. Sure.” I shout and move towards the running vehicle. \\n\\nThe screaming has stopped, but it’s obvious things aren’t going well. I get in the back seat. Beth wears gold hoop earrings. She bites her lip and puts it in reverse. Sal is looking straight ahead. He folds his arms and hasn’t said anything for several minutes while she sways her head every time she shifts in the old Civic. She’s being dramatic. No words are spoken until we get outside of some shops with apartment buildings up top in Chinatown. We’re just a few blocks from the Pinball museum. I know where it is, because it’s one of the first things I was ever invited to do after I got sober, but just like that Mariner’s game the kid invited me to the other night, I never went, but I did walk by it almost every day to and from work when I was a valet. \\n\\nAnyway, Sal has his hands in his hoodie belly pocket. He looks at me. His eyes are lucid. Beth wears a brown leather jacket with all kinds of buckles and tighter jeans than normal. She clutches her bag behind us and steps with an angry, chemically induced swish. Her heels clack on the pavement. She’s wearing sunglasses.  \\n\\n“Guess, it ain’t all Chinese in Chinatown, huh?” I say.\\n\\n“Guess not.” Sal says.\\n\\nBeth is quiet as Sal presses the button up to whatever apartment his man is in and we wait. Rain drops fall. It’s chilly outside. The door buzzes, and we walk up two flights of stairs to a bare concrete hallway. Asian music plays through the wall. The singer sounds lovesick, and the strange smells of foreign foods waft through the building. Apartments are small up here, and it’s warmer than it is outside. Sal takes us to the last door by the window looking out over the street, and he knocks. Feet move across the floor. The chain unlatches from inside. \\n\\nA small woman looks out and beckons us in. Inside there is a small Vietnamese man with a white tank top on with windbreaker pants and a pair of black slippers. He wears a jade Buddah on a gold chain around his neck. There is another gold chain on his wrist. The 30 something year old man sits at the table with a several full-sized sandwich bags holding large pressed pieces of dope. He smiles excitedly and holds his hand out,\\n\\n“Oh. So, you Sal’s boy, huh?” He tilts his head back, like he’s inspecting me.\\n\\n“Yeah. This is the Junky Vonnegut.” Sal interrupts.\\n\\nThe man ignores Sal. “My name is Thahn, but you call me Tony. Okay?” His accent is thick.\\n\\n“Okay, Tony.” I say.\\n\\nHe is beaming, ignoring Sal completely. Beth sits on the couch with her legs crossed. One foot kicks. Her arms are folded. Tony’s woman or whoever she is has gone back into the bedroom. She uses a mirror in her lap and folded cards to deposit small amounts of white powder from a pile into the small wax baggies I’ve been selling. Every so many, she wraps them up in a rubber band. I know the number is 14. \\n\\nTony tries to address me as Vonnegut but says, “Runnyket, I sell for my father. We have much more. We want sell more, now. You sell for us?”\\n\\n“Yes,” I smile, “I sell for you.”\\n\\n“Okay. Very good. I have everything you want. No problem.”\\n\\n“What will you do for 7,500?”\\n\\n“7,500? You not messing around Runnyket.” \\n\\n“It’s what I got, today.” I act cool as if I know what the standard amounts are for that kind of money but am just waiting to see if the deal he’s cutting is any good. \\n\\n“7,500?” He pronounces each word with a long, skeptical whine. His voice is low. “7,500 Runnyket?”\\n\\n“Yes. 7,500.”\\n\\n“Okay. I give you deal, man.” He sits up and speaks louder. “Half pound. Good deal, man.”\\n\\nI figure in my head that’s less than 1,000 bucks an ounce. For the quality and price I know one of those little baggies will fetch, this deal will make me rich. Beth stands up and announces that she’s going to the bathroom. Sal sits on a recliner in the dark corner focused on me and Tony talking. He looks at us sideways. He bites his nails. The mechanism on the doorknob clicks as Beth shuts the door behind her. I pull my money out of my pocket to count out five 100-dollar bills which I keep and toss the rest on the table. Tony picks it up and counts it.  \\n\\n  A minute later, he says, “Okay, Runnyket. Take.” He hands me eight of the sandwich bags on the table, one by one. “Okay?”\\n\\n“Sure. You have a bag?”\\n\\n“Yeah. Rose. Get bag for Runnyket!”\\n\\nThe Asian lady who let us in gets up off the bed, sets the mirror down on the mattress and walks into the kitchen. She leans down and opens a door. She hands me one of those reusable fabric grocery bags you can buy at the store for a couple of bucks. I load the ounces into the bag. \\n\\nThe sink is running in the bathroom. It’s been going for a while, and there’s a loud thud from inside of it that causes the glass in the apartment to vibrate. Something’s wrong. Sounds are funny like that. When they’re serious, you know it. Like when you hear someone’s skull split open on the pavement or the way a person screams in crisis or just the sound of a body falling to the floor in a way that’s serious. You can’t mistake it. You know something’s wrong. Maybe, it isn’t so much the sound itself, but the absence of any sound or movement on either side of the sound that makes it obvious. No sounds of getting up signal my subconscious that it’s not just no big deal. The water’s still running. That’s it.  \\n\\nSal jumps up and opens the door. Beth is laid out like a wet dishrag on the floor. She's sweating. Blood runs from her arm and neck. It looks like there’s a gash in her head from the fall. An uncapped needle rolls across the floor. Sal grabs her bag and digs in it.\\n\\n“COME ON! COME ON! Where is it?” He says frantically. “HERE!” He holds a naloxone nasal sprayer in his hand and leans over her face to administer it. Sal slaps her and props her head up. “Come on! Come on, baby!”\\n\\nTony and his woman are staring at the scene with their hands on their waist. Sal finds another plastic nasal sprayer and holds it in case the first one doesn’t work. Tony leans over and asks him,\\n\\n“She live?”\\n\\n“I think so.”\\n\\n“Good, Sal. No more.”\\n\\n“No more what?” Sal asks. He sounds irritated. \\n\\nRose has walked over with a wet towel in her hands and wrings it out on the overdosed girl’s face. Beth moans. It’s this very dramatic and ungraceful vocalization that is pitiful to watch and hear and makes me realize how much grace Beth has always had. She’s lost it since she stared using so hard, and that is hard to see. A web of spittle hangs between the lips of her open mouth on the floor, and she moans again. There is the unmistakable smell of someone who has defecated on themselves in the apartment.\\n\\n“No more, Sal. No more business, man. We finish. You go to Runnyket, now. Runnyket sell you.”  \n",

guy.\\n\\nHe said 10 last night, so I’m up early. Do a shot. Smoke a cigarette and run to the bank. This is me going all in. I’m taking the money my grandmother left me out of the bank. When there’s something I know I shouldn’t do and don’t actually want to do, when I’m about to be stupid, my mind does this thing where it just goes blank. Like, it knows how to walk me to the ATM outside of my bank. My brain remembers the pin number and how to operate the screen. It tells my feet how to get back to the motel, but it doesn’t think about what’s really going on. My mind somehow pushes out the painful reality, the sickening thought of going back on my grandmother’s will for me and the money she left me. It was sort of a joke when I told you that she didn’t want me to spend it. I mean. That was a slight exaggeration, but she’d throw a fit if she knew I was about to take that 8000 dollars and use it to buy a major amount of heroin. I am coming up today. Today changes everything.\\n\\nAs I get back to the room and walk through the parking lot, there’s no movement. No body outside. No cars running. It’s just silent and dismal under the sunless sky, like time’s inertia got frozen still somehow and stuck in the grey crystal of this moment, because outside of the trap motel, outside of every trap motel all across America, it’s always the same. Hard. Miserable, and everyone is looking to come up. \\n\\nWell, I got mine, and I’m holding this huge wad of bills in my hand inside of my pocket as I get back to the room. There’s this sign on the door, though. It’s taped up and the words are scrawled onto it pretty poorly. I’m guessing some boys from middle school wrote and left it. It reads:\\n\\n Hey Dill Hole,\\n\\nWe know what you been doing. Stop it. Or we’ll get you.    \\n\\nThe reason I say that middle schoolers wrote it is because I can’t think of anyone who would ever address someone as dill hole that wasn’t in middle school. Shoot, that probably ends in fifth grade. Anyone still saying dill hole in sixth grade must be a special case, and so, I don’t really know what the letter’s about, but I’m doing all kinds of bad things. People are getting hurt. I think of Beth and her daughter. Lives are being ruined mine included, and I just came down from all that meth. There’s a dirty gun under my bed. Paranoia is still lingering, as I open the door and walk into the room. My intentions haven’t changed, though. I’m still going to buy a lot of heroin. Sal is taking me to meet his man in just a bit, and just like that, a horn is honking outside.\n",

and is asking if there’s any kind of deal. I hand him seven bags for the 100 and let him know that if he comes back with money, we can work out something more consistent. Ed gives me a fist bump and runs out of the room excited by the information. Then, there’s an obnoxious banging. I know that’s Sal. He comes in, and Beth follows behind him with her arms crossed and head down. She’s different than I’ve ever known her to be. Quiet. Sullen. There’s makeup on her face, like I’ve never seen before, mostly eye stuff and lipstick. Her nose looks green and swollen under the powder.\\n\\n“Whoah! Man! What the hell is that smell?” Sal’s eyes twist. He speaks words laced with ethanol vapor and takes a seat at the little table in the corner. \\n\\n“You don’t want to know.”\\n\\n“How can you stand it?”\\n\\nLike everything else, the dope, the meth turning my mind into mush, the hallucinations, the gun under the bed, the paranoia, the smell was really hard to take at first, but now, I’m used to it. “I don’t even notice it, now.”\\n\\n“Don’t notice it? How’s that?” He extends his good hand and arm towards Beth. She moves toward him and sits in his lap.\\n\\n“I don’t know. Just got used to it, I guess.”\\n\\nSal has pulled a bag of what I’m guessing is cocaine out of his pocket. He pours some on the back of his at the base of his thumb and snorts it, does it again and snorts it with his other nostril this time. Then, Sal pours another one and pushes Beth’s head to it. She snorts. He pulls her back by the hair. She holds one nostril shut and inhales sharply.\\n\\n“Well, it’s gross, yo. So, what you need?”\\n\\n“400 bucks is what I got.”\\n\\n“34 plust 34 is 68. So, I’ll give you……………… five bundles. That’s 70 bags.” This deal is not as good as the last one. He’s doing coke, though. What do I expect. \\n\\n“Sure. Whatever.”\\n\\nSal counts them out and tosses them on the bed. I hand him the 400. Beth has still not spoken or looked at me, even. I feel bad for her. \\n\\n“My boy wants to put you to work.” Sal shakes his head. “I wouldn’t give you up, but he says this is how it goes. You know what I’m saying? I told him how you were doing with it. So, he bought me out. Now you’re gonna have the hook up yourself.”\\n\\nI nod and look at Beth, again. What happened to her daughter? I ask myself. “Sounds good. What time?”\\n\\n“We’ll be by at like ten. Right?” He raises his voice, so Beth understands that’s how it’s going down. “Yeah. Ten. Good?”\\n\\n“Sure.” \\n\\nBeth never says anything to me. She never looks at me. They leave, and once they’re gone, the whole thing hits me like a depression. I ask myself how much I contributed to putting her in that situation, and even though I was never particularly fond of her child, I feel grief for her, too. This is the life. All that crap you see in the movies or read in books about how cool it all drugs are is just that. Crap. Keith Richards is an anomaly. Mostly people don’t live as long as he has, and what’s more, we’re not rock stars doing junk. We’re junkies doing junk. We’re slaves. Even when we we’re on top of the game, it still owns us. She never even looked at me. He owns her now, and it breaks my heart.  \\n\\n  \n",

at 15, he didn’t go to them anymore. He never took me anyway, but when I was little we went to one where they had this table all devoted to smaller home appliances. There were microwaves and toasters and mini ovens and that kind of thing and then there were three waffle irons. Well, when I opened one of the waffle irons, it had pieces of batter stuck in the square grid crevices, like whoever owned it before was giving you a little piece of themselves with their waffle iron. It was gross. I showed my dad, and we laughed so hard that other customers laughed, too.\\n\\nI have a similar imaginations about the gun I just bought. They’re not funny though. Seriously, I hate it. What kind of implications does it carry for me just having it in my possession? What terrible things has it done? Has it killed? It’s become this massive worry in my mind that my whole life revolves around, and when I think about it, it’s like the waffle iron at that flea market. The same way there were bits of waffle batter left in the griddle is the same way I imagine pieces of someone else’s brain and blood or hair are left in the gun. Maybe, a tooth is lodged in the barrel somewhere, but I’m too scared of the gun to look. I don’t even know if it’s loaded or how to load it or how to shoot it. It’s stupid for me to have it, but it’s under my bed, now. It’s part of the ride I’m riding, the life I’m living, the death I’m dying, whatever you want to call it.     \\n\\nI do a shot. Shots of heroin make my problems go away. Shots of heroin also make more problems for me. That’s why I’m where I’m at now. Heroin addiction is funny like that. While I’m rushing, Sal calls. \\n\\n“Where you at?” He asks.\\n\\n“In the city.”\\n\\n“Oh yeah?”\\n\\n“Yeah. Where else?”\\n\\n“In a hotie or what?”\\n\\n“Yeah. Got a room for the week.”\\n\\n“Aight. Aight. Cool, man. My boy said he wants to meet you. Said he wanted to know who’s selling so much for me.”\\n\\n“Cool. I was going to call you anyway. I need to re-up.”\\n\\n“Alright. I’ll stop by. Give me the address.” \\n\\n“Sure,” I say, “Room 127 at the L\\*\\*\\*\\*\\* Motel and Motor Lodge. Knock when you’re here.”\\n\\n“Oh. Yeah. Beth’s coming, too.”\n",

    \\n\\n20\\n\\nMorning is going on outside.\\n\\nAnother day. I dread it. I mean. Even though I’ve got all this dope and a place to stay and cash in my pocket, even though the last 3 days have literally been the best it has have ever gone for me as an addict, even so, I hate it. Every breath, every moment, every calorie, every movement, everyone of my thoughts is devoted to an enterprise that is guaranteed to kill me and destroy everything around me. Eventually, it will catch up to me. It will kill me, but here I go again, wondering who’ll buy what I’ve got. If I come up and make a profit off them, there’s a chance they’ll die. It makes me sick in a way. Even worse, my phone has a missed call from Jerry, so I pull my rig out from last night and sit at the kitchenette counter and use a few drops of water to mix the dope up right in the baggie. \\n\\nIt works. The stuff doesn’t need to be heated. I nod out for a while. Sometime around noon, there’s some shouting outside of my door, and so I get up to open it and see what’s going on. There’s a lady. She’s screaming across the parking lot at some random dude, saying,\\n\\n“I’m not getting naked for you! Never. You can keep dreaming.” She pronounces it ‘nekkit.’\\n\\nHe seems as confused by it as I am and shrugs as he walks faster. The woman wears a black trash bag like a skirt which reveals one hairy leg and fat foot with jagged toenails. She is squat and very wide. Her hair is long. Long breasts hang over her belly through her shirt. The woman turns to me and asks me if I’ve seen Hank.\\n\\n“Hank?” I have no idea who that is.\\n\\n“Ya haven’t seen him?”\\n\\nMaybe she thinks I am whoever had the room last. She should know that I have no idea who Hank is. Even if I had seen him, I couldn’t tell her, but I haven’t seen anyone. I tell her so.\\n\\n“Not me. I haven’t seen anyone.”\\n\\n“Hmmm….” She looks side to side with squinty eyes. “Well, do you know what he did?”\\n\\nI don’t know what Hank did.\\n\\n“Run off on me. Gone. I went up to see my daughter day before yesterday and spent the night. Come back yesterday afternoon, and you know what I found? You know what he left me?”\\n\\nShe’s looking at me. Her hands are up in the air and moving around dramatically. Those bushy eyebrows turn up in excited expectation. I shrug.\\n\\n“Left me a note written on the wall. Said. Priscilla I’m done. And you know what he wrote it in?” \\n\\n“No.” \\n\\n“Wrote the Dear Jane letter in feces! Can you believe that?” Except, she pronounces it ‘fee shees.’ Just like that, which makes my mind wander to this old hotel handyman I knew once. He had been in Vietnam and told me about how he used to have to crawl through the enemy’s tunnels, up to his neck in human species. He meant feces. He just said species, and I guess no one ever corrected him. Neither did I, but now that I’m thinking about that, I wonder. Why are they called feces? Like, what’s plural about it? Is each particle or nugget and individual fece, but when they all get together, they become plural? “Left me the letter in his own feces?” She says ‘fee shees,’ again. The woman breaks down into a mess of tears and sobbing and walks away. \\n\\nNot long after that, I see another kid hanging on the steps by his room. He’s smoking a cigarette. I walk over and ask him for a light. \\n\\n“You staying in that room?”\\n\\n“The room I just came out of?”\\n\\n“Yeah.”\\n\\n“Obviously.” I laugh.\\n\\n“True. They didn’t tell you, did they?”\\n\\n“Tell me what?”\\n\\n“Oh man.” He shakes his head.\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“They found a dead guy in there last month. The firetrucks and police and all that was here. It was a mad house.”\\n\\nI swallow hard. “What?”\\n\\n“Yeah, man! Found him a week or something after he’d been sitting in there in the heat. Blew his head off and no one ever reported the gun shot. I heard it, you know? But you know how it is. None of us want the cops around. Anyway, sat there, man, in the heat just decaying, until someone smelled it and called it in. Sad, bro. Real sad.”\\n\\n“That is.” My thoughts are not about the tragedy but about the sign saying no refunds or room switches in the lobby and the smell. That’s what I’m feeling sad about. “You know where it happened in there?”\\n\\n“Yeah. They said it was over by the bathroom door.” \\n\\n“Man.”\\n\\n“Yeah. So, you know, it’s pretty crappy that they didn’t tell you.” \\n\\n“Yeah.” I say and take a pull of my cigarette. “What’s your name?”\\n\\n“They call me Ed.”\\n\\n“Word. What you mess around with?”\\n\\n“Mess with?”\\n\\n“Yeah.”\\n\\n“I sling crystal. I like to do me some dope though every once in a while. Why?”\\n\\n“Well, I got it right here.”\\n\\n“Dope?” He has thick glasses that magnify his eyes so that they’re too big and a backwards Raiders cap. \\n\\n“Yeah.”\\n\\n“Well, I ain’t got any money on me this second. My chick’s down the street with our dude on the re-up. All I can give you is some meth.”\\n\\nI move my head slowly from side to side, like it has a marble in it or something and I’m listening to it roll across the floor of my brain and then back again. Meth is not my choice chemical to consume. In fact, it makes me very anxious and has a long list of other negative side effects that I really can’t stand, but the addict in me speaks up and says, \\n\\n“Aight. Sure.” The whole deal is to show him that I have something good, anyway. So, after he gives me one of his, I give him one of mine and ask, “What’s up with that lady? You know?”\\n\\n“Oh her?” He motions with his head toward my room and the one next to it. \\n\\n“Yeah. Her.”\\n\\n“I don’t know man. Crazy. I guess. Me and my girl been here a few months. She was here before us. Always running around screaming at people about how they can’t have her, that she’s saving herself for her Hank.”\\n\\n“Yeah. She said something about that.”\\n\\n“Yeah. Well. I ain’t ever met no Hank. Ain’t ever seen any dudes in or out of her room. She’s just crazy.” He flicks his cigarette into the grass. \\n\\nI nod in agreement and walk back to my room. He walks back into his. The day is sunnier than it has been the last two or three, but it’s got that nip in the air that makes sure you know it’s fall no matter how bright the day is and that it’s not getting warmer. It’s getting colder, now. Last year, I got really depressed about it. This year, I’m too depressed about my life and the fresh track marks on my arm to know how I feel about the weather.    \\n\\n  \n",

         \\n\\n19\\n\\nThe lobby at the hotel is cold.\\n\\nMy clothes are wet again. There are 600 bucks in my pocket. That’ll get me a week and then some at this sleaze bucket motel. Besides that, though, there’s another 75 bags in my other, and the shot I did in Cowboy’s car on the way here is hitting me hard. I fade out. I wake up and fade out again. My eyes open once more. There’s a fat man at the window, renting his room for the night, and I grab one of the brochures on the rack showing the local tourist attractions. This one is about a haunted tour of some buildings in the city, and I put it up to my face like I’m reading, an inch away from my eyeballs, to hide the fact that I’m very obviously high and nodding out in the lobby.\\n\\nThe fat man gets his receipt and walks out the door. I stand up and come to the window.\\n\\n“How much for a week?”\\n\\n“439 dollar.” The English is not easy to understand.\\n\\n“Okay.” I pull five of the bills in my pocket out and slide them under the window. I notice a sign that says customers need to check their rooms before paying because refunds and room changes are not possible. It’s a testament to how terrible the motel really is. I point to the sign and tell the man, “Hey, what about the sign that says you should probably get your typhoid and tetanus shots before you stay here?” And laugh.\\n\\nHe doesn’t understand but makes a face I know well. It’s the face people make when I’m high and they are disgusted by the things I’m saying or just the way I’m saying them and how I look. I’ve seen it lots. The thing is, though, that when you’re so high that people are angry about it, it’s basically impossible to not act that way.\\n\\n“Here. Change.” He slides back a 50 and a ten-dollar bill with a few coins. “Key. Control.” He slides me the control and key under the window, too.\\n\\nI nod to him and walk out. The rain is still falling. One of the lights off the side of the office illuminates the drops which look like angry insects divebombing the parking lot pavement. The key they gave me has one of those old school plastic pieces with the room number on it, 127. It is poorly cut and requires a bit of struggle to finally turn, but once I get inside, the room is warm and filthy. The maid probably cleaned it or whatever, but there are holes in the drywall and crayon marks everywhere and the mattress is so lumpy that you can actually see how misshapen it is right through the comforter all covered in fuzz and lint balls. Along the wall a strip of red carpet sits poorly contrasted with and even more poorly seamed together with the blue that covers the rest of the room, except by the bathroom. There's another square patch against the wall there, too. But worse than the way anything looks is the smell. There’s a mini fridge. It’s old and dented and the paint has chipped off in places, maybe a replacement for the last one that got left unplugged for a long time with meat in it. The smell of rotten flesh of pigs or chickens has soaked into the carpet and fabric, permanently. Nothing will ever completely get rid of the smell. \\n\\nI throw my bag against the nightstand, plug my phone in and strip off my jacket and shirt. The last shot I did was so good that I nod out for a minute standing up by the bed. It’s like the feeling is warm gold running through my veins. I think that’s cliché or something someone said about it before me, but the image in my mind is of some early 90s video game character when they get like 100 gold coins or rings or whatever they’re picking up all over the place knocked out of them, but it’s the opposite. Instead of losing the gold, it’s me and I’m absorbing this swarm of gold doubloons from out of the air. That’s what I see, when I’m nodded out. It feels so good. Then, I wake up and want to watch something.\\n\\nI get on the bed and grab the remote, but it doesn’t turn the TV on easily enough for me to keep messing with it, so I throw it on the floor and see a bible on the other nightstand. It looks to have globs of dried, hot glue on the cover but cloudier. I touch it for a moment, before it occurs to me that it might be dried semen. Jacking off on bibles is not something I’ve done much of. So, it wasn’t my first thought. It’s pretty irritating, though. Why such disrespect? Why waste your time? I don’t even wash my hands. I just nod out for the night.\n",

and heavy falling into the toilet water. There are one, two, three stop and go splashes like an ellipsis in my mind and then the chink of the lever. Water runs through the pipes in the ceiling overhead and down the far wall. My body doesn’t move, but my eyes take inventory of the apartment. Our spoons and syringes have been put away. By Beth I presume. She is stuck in the act of lighting a candle. A match in one hand. The box in the other, and the Autumn Apple candle sits unlit on the coffee table. Beth is hunched over it. She looks like a computer game character stuck in a glitch of unnatural and repetitive movement. She bounces, nodding out just to barely wake back up several times each second. It’s something I used to do. Shoot. It’s something I’ll probably be doing a lot of here soon. \\n\\tI sit up. I lean forward on the couch. There’s still plenty of dope in me, but I am coming down. My body parts move in one slow and sleepy pull after another. My nose itches. It’s something like birth sitting there slimy and sweaty and confused on her couch, cold and wet, coming to grips with the depression of reality after spending those few hours in nirvana. It’s not that depressing, though. There are still 14 bags of heroin in my pocket, a place to stay for the night and a hook up on some pure. That’s my reality right, now. I rub my face and try to stand. \\n\\tBeth must sense me moving around and wakes up to spend another minute or so getting a match lit and all the way to the wick of the candle before it goes out. Evening’s blue light glows over the roofs across the street. A siren whines through traffic somewhere in the distance. Curtains hang like half closed eyelids in the square windows pouring out that warm golden light from inside of the buildings out into the darkness. They are portals into the lives of families and single folk home for dinner or watching the evening news. They show me something I want, like paintings on a giant museum wall portraying normal kinds of life I’ll never know, reminding me of everything I’m not. There’s a gurgle in my gut asking me to eat. \\nSo, I ask Beth,\\n\\t“You got anything to eat or drink?”\\n\\tShe says, “There’s O.J. in the fridge,” and holds two fingers to her chin for a moment. Her eyes close slowly. They open. Beth strikes a match and finally gets the candle lit.  \\t\\n\\tI pull the handle on the refrigerator door and look in. There’s a two-liter bottle of soda next to the orange juice and a few hotdogs wrapped in cellophane and a bottle of ranch dressing and a bottle of vinaigrette in the door with some milk. There’s an open half-dozen carton with three eggs left in it. In the back is a can of spam covered in tinfoil. I whisper into the cold white light, \\n\\t“Spam Baby,” and grab the O.J.\\n\\tAn old wine glass is all I can find in the cabinet. It’s an awkward thing to drink out of, but it works. I see a couple of bananas and a bag of some dried-out berries and sesame seeds next to the microwave. When I open the bag and sniff, my head does one of those spasmatic and involuntary jerks. I hold it up and shout out to her in the living room.\\n\\t“What’s this crap? Hamster food?” I am not entirely convinced a hamster would eat it, but I already know it’s hers. Beth eats like that. That’s why she’s so thin.\\n\\t“No. That’s mine.” \\n\\t“You eat this?” \\n\\tShe laughs. “Yeah. I do.”\\n\\t“Who else’s been staying here?”\\n\\t“What?”\\n\\t“The spam in the back of the fridge?”\\n\\t“What? Oh you saw that?”\\n\\t“Yeah. Don’t you know about Spam Babies?”\\n\\t“Spam Babies? What? Oh, no! My kid!” \\n\\tBeth grabs her hoodie lying on the floor and has it in her hand walking backwards out the door. Her keys are in her hand. She tells me she’ll be right back. The apartment is quiet and dark. It has a nice energy. Candle flame flickers orange in the living room. The room is warm, and the couch is comfortable. \\n\\n16\\n\\nMartin’s apartment door is painted white and has three black metal numbers on it.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tSoft steps move towards the door. Martin is talking on the phone. He opens it and gestures for us to sit on the couch. I just called him from Beth’s this morning, after she let me cook up the rest of that can of Spam in her refrigerator. She made plans to drop the kid off at her sisters, again, and now, here we are. Martin is wearing a bathrobe. He paces while he talks.  \\n\\t“Yeah! Mom! Those are my chickens and my rooster. I don’t care if Larry said he’s the one feeding them. They’re not his to give away. Mom! No. Listen….. No way….. That’s wrong and you know it….Well, he never gave me a chance. Did he? Did he? That’s my rooster! And I don’t care!” He stamps his foot down on the clean beige carpet as he screams, like a child throwing a fit. Beth giggles. She looks at me and makes as if to ask, is this really happening? It is. \\n\\tMartin’s like that. I don’t know how to say it, except that in all the years that I’ve known him, there’s been one constant. He makes me want to punch him in the face. Not all the time but often. It’s just the effect he has on people. He’ll hurt you the way children hurt you with honest and unflinching observation. Martin will attack your character for no good reason. Say something he doesn’t like, and he’ll tell you how that’s an expression of your extremely hideous nature as a human in his condescending tone. You’re disgusting. That seems to be his answer for anyone who disagrees with him or offends him. \\nAnother thing about it is that Martin disperses these little bits of unwelcome info with conceited wags of the head, like some sophisticated version of a chick in the ghetto. His wrists are thin, too. Now, I have nothing against men with feminine affectations. That would be a waste of time, but subconsciously, I think that he and I share some of those attributes, and perhaps my fear is that I’m walking around as feminine and rude as he is and no one is telling me. The thought is horrifying and perhaps a source of pent up anger, but like I said, I’m not the only one. Plenty of people have had their issues with him. \\n\\tBack in the day, it was Peter Donaldson, Martin and me. We were always together. They were the first people I ever got high with, at least on things besides weed, like mushrooms and Percocet and LSD and ecstasy and even some bumps of cocaine once or twice. All the other kids called us the Trippy Trio on account of there were three of us and all the psychedelics we liked to take. \\nPetey was a great guy. I miss him, now. Unfortunately, he dropped some acid one night with some other kids out in Enumclaw. This was after we got out of high school and kind of drifted apart from each other. They were out there drinking liquor and dosing and a car smashed Petey on the highway. The kids he was with saw it all. Legend has it that all that was left of him could be scraped off the asphalt and fit into a shoebox, like all that was left of him was a puddle of sludge with a few organs floating in it or something. Maybe, the better way to say it is that legend had it, because I’m not sure anyone talks about it enough to consider it a legend, anymore. His mother and father in their mourning have left off telling it. I’m sure. It’s been 13 years. Besides, the phrase ‘fit into a shoebox’ doesn’t strike me as the kind of language my dead friend’s parents would use in talking about the tragedy. He was their only son. They only have their daughter left, but that was the story for a long time. All that was left of Petey could be fit into a shoebox. \\nI wanted to care. I really did, when I found out, but I’d just figured out how to inject myself, homeless in the city of San Francisco at 19 years old and was doing a lot of meth. My father had died the year or so before that. Big shots of crank had already hammered my mind into hamburger meat my first week down there, and I’d completely lost it. I was answering phone calls from strange men who wanted to pay me for some company or picking through piles of refuse on the sidewalk for clothes to wear, always looking like some prehistoric savage on my skateboard with stolen hood ornaments hanging from my waist and strange fur hats and goggles while I cut in and out of deadly traffic in the rainy fog. It was as if I was living out the fantasy of some depraved comic book character my drug addled imagination had created. My mind kept slipping into these paranoid schizophrenic fogs. I was committing crimes. I was injecting drugs. Caring just wasn’t possible. \\nIt makes me sad now, when I think about it. Petey was genuinely the nicest guy I knew my age, and that’s not one of those skewed postmortem affirmations of his character people like to give. He really was. Everyone knew that. Petey definitely deserved more of a chance at life than me or Martin, but now, Martin and I are all that are left. \\nHe’s wrapping up the phone call now and sitting on the couch across from us. Beth and I sit in chairs. The view through the window behind him shows a crane and city buildings, the water behind that. It’s right downtown.\\n“Okay, mom. I’ll talk to you soon.” He hangs up and tosses the phone on the couch next to him. “Well, Randy. Good to see you. What’s it been?” I haven’t seen him since I got sober. \\n“Two years. Just about. This is a really nice place, man. What are you doing these days?”\\n“I got my law degree. Finally. I think I was wrapping that up, right? Last time we saw each other?” He ignores Beth like she isn’t there with us. I don’t remember what he was doing with his life the last time I saw him, other than buying large quantities of black tar from me at a high price, sleazing it up on the car lot as a salesman and putting me down when we got high together in his last apartment. It wasn’t near as nice as this one.  \\n“Yeah. Sure. I think that sounds right.” I smile.\\n“But, you know how it goes.” \\nI have no idea how it goes for a person with a law degree, but I nod. “Sure.”\\n“Yeah. My mom really wants me to get on with a firm around here. She has all kinds of friends who can get me on at some of the biggest in town, but I’m still selling cars. Money’s just way, way too good and way too easy, Randy. Way too easy for me.” Martin gives me a deviant smile. “Who’s this?”\\n“This is Beth.” I say. She reaches out to shake his hand over his glass coffee table. \\n“Nice to meet you,” he says as he sits back down. “So, what’s up, Randy? What’s this all about?”\\nI throw one of the D.O.A. baggies onto the glass. He picks it up, studies it and looks at me. \\n“What’s this?”\\n“What does it look like?”\\n“I’m asking you. Looks like a small line of coke.”\\n“Heroin.”\\n“But it’s white.”\\n“China White.”\\n“What’s that?” \\n“Number four.”\\n“You know, Randy, we’re not all lifelong junkies like you. Okay?” There are hints of that condescension I told you about, but it’s not that bad, not like it can be. \\n“It’s pure stuff.”\\n“Pure?” His face is pointed down at the bag in his hand. His eyes look through slits up at me, like he’s skeptical. \\n“Get your rig out. You’ll see.” I say.\\n\\n\\n17\\n\\nBefore Martin even gets up to get his shooting gear, he asks me how much I have.\\n\\n\\tI count in my head the 16 that Sal gave me yesterday. I subtract the two that Beth and I did last night. I allow two more for myself right now and count one more for Beth. That’s 16 minus two, so 14. Then, two for me and one for Beth, right now. That’s 14 minus three. So, 11 bags I can part with.\\n\\t“Got 11 bags I can sell, right now.” I tell him. \\n\\t“How much?”\\n\\t“I want 20 a piece for each.” The reason I say it like that is that I know that’s now how much they are. Something about myself won’t let me tell outright lies. I have to talk around things to get away with stuff. \\n\\t“So, 220? What about two bills, even?”\\n\\t“You got it.” I let him think he’s getting a deal.  \\nI pull the sandwich bag out of my pocket and separate three of the little square D.O.A. baggies from the rubber banded bundle inside of it. Martin walks into his bedroom. Beth opens her eyes wide. She can’t believe it. When Martin comes back, he’s holding an ornately carved mahogany cigar box with a golden placard too worn down to read and two hundred-dollar bills. He lays the bills on the table and sets the box down. I toss him the 11 baggies in the rubber band. \\nBeth pulls a syringe out of her purse for herself and one for me. She hands it to me. Martin is making clanking and tapping sounds with what I guess is a spoon and a lighter and whatever else he’s using. I can’t see what he’s doing on the other side of the box. The rubber band snaps. Beth touches my shoulder with a plastic bottle cap. She has one for herself, and we repeat the process of the day before. Beth sterilizes her arm with alcohol and ties off. I just start digging in the meat of my forearm, right away. Martin has his foot on the table, looking for a vein in his foot. Soon, all three of us are leaning forward in our seats, like we’re playing some weird game of who can get their foreheads closest to the table without touching it. \\n“…So good,” comes out of Beth’s mouth in a whisper. There’s some indistinct mumbling on either side of the words.\\nMy eyes are closed. Chunks fill my mouth. I try to hold it in but fall out of my chair hurrying to the sink. The masticated chunks of pink, partially digested Spam spew onto the carpet. A nasty orange slime coats them like an afterbirth of the little aborted fetuses. They have a putrid stench, lying gross upon the floor. Shouldn’t have had that orange juice. I think to myself. Some more comes out. It burns my nose, and strings of the stinky slime hang from my chin. \\nMartin is out, though. I got what I came for. Better get out of here, before he wakes up and starts complaining about the vomit and its smell. So, I shake Beth awake and tell her we have to go. It’s hard for her to walk, but we get out and down the stairs to her car. She’s buckled up in the driver’s seat. I’m buckled up in the passenger’s seat.  We are both slumped forward and nodded out. \\n\\n    \\n\\t  \\n\n",



                                                                                                                                                                     11\\n\\nBeth’s mouth hangs open, and her gaze is fixed on me as I talk on the phone.\\n\\t\\n\\tShe’s got these brittle little pebble teeth set far apart from one another in her gums. They’re not particularly crooked or stacked in rows like some people’s, but they’re definitely not straight. Don’t get me wrong. She’s pretty. Her big brown eyes and thin face work really will with the way she keeps her hair, which is short. She’s just had her struggles with drugs in life and like the rest of us, our teeth give us away. I run my tongue along the jagged crater in one of my own teeth.  \\nWhen we first started hanging out, Beth used to wear these cheap falsies that were always falling out and separating from her eyelids. She even used to have her nails all done up and wore those dumb three hundred-dollar pairs of jeans with all that bling on the back pockets. You know the ones I’m talking about, right? But not anymore. I think it was because she’d just gotten sober and her best friend from the rehab she’d been in was into all of that. It never seemed to fit on Beth. Anyway, by the time she had her baby, that other girl had moved on to someone else and Beth went back to wearing the Pink Floyd shirts and green army jackets and cheap second-hand jeans with the frayed heels and old skater shoes. All of that is more her style. \\n\\nHer fingernails are bleedy, ragged nubs which tells me she’s using, again. She’s chewing one now. The child is smashing one of her toys against the table and making snotty noise with her mouth. I’m not sure how bad Beth’s using, but I’m about to find out. \\n\\nSal asks me how many I want on the phone. He never told me how much they cost, so I just tell him that I’ve got 120 bucks. Beth licks her bottom lip and leans forward, while Sal says he’ll give me a deal over the phone. He tells me to call him back in ten minutes to find out where to go. \\n\\nI hang up, and she asks, \\n“Who’s that?”\\n“Sal.”\\n“Do I know him?”\\n“You should. He’s tall. Got black hair. You don’t know Sal? He goes to meetings. Well, he was going to meetings for like the last two years. You’ve seen him.”\\n“I don’t know.”\\n“He’s got the limp and his right arm is all beat back.”\\nShe shakes her head.\\n“Dee Dee is his girlfriend. You know the one with the blond hair and crazy green eyes. She’s always going off at the meetings about her dad and how he molested her growing up and all of that.”\\n“Oh, yeah! So, her boyfriend?”\\n“That’s the story.”\\n“He’s working?” There’s a quiver in her voice. \\n“Mmhmm.” \\n“What’re you gonna get?”\\n“What do you think I’m gonna get, Beth?”\\n“Dope.”\\n“Good guess.” \\n“Yeah. Well, I didn’t know you were using. I thought you were going on like two years, here soon. What about that?”\\n“Not now.” I shrug. “He’s about to call back. Are you wanting in on this or what?”\\nBeth looks at the kid. She looks back up at me. “Yeah. I’ll give you a ride.” \\n\\t      \\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\n12\\n\\nA melon headed kid collects shopping carts in the Fred Meyer’s parking lot.\\n\\n\\tBeth is sitting in the driver’s seat. She is gripping the steering wheel and pulling herself forward and holding her breath. She wears a maroon knit cap. Her kid is in the back in a car seat eating Goldfish from a plastic cup. The interior has been plastered with thrown food items and the multicolored paste of saliva soggy cereal. It gives the car a distinct smell, the way hamster cages have that distinct smell but different. You know, the mixture of bedding and food and the different biological excretions all mixed together in a poorly ventilated container? \\n\\tMy phone rings. I answer. Sal tells me he’s at the Starbuck’s and will be out in a minute. I tell him we’re in a brown Civic with a grey door and hood by the outdoor section. Only a few minutes pass before he’s jumping into the back seat and sitting next to the baby. I pull out my money. Sal shows me a rubber band wrapped number of the same D.O.A. baggies from the day before, but they’re all inside of another bigger baggie. \\n\\t“Look. There’s 16 bags in there. I’m a do you right if you keep bringing me money.”\\n\\t“Okay.” I say.\\n\\t“Try to get 200 if you can. I’ll give you 30 bags. So what ya think? Fire right?”\\n\\t“Oh yeah. Just wanna see what it’s like when I shoot it.”\\n\\t“Bags are ten a piece from me. My boys told me I need to be giving deals and get people working under me. It’s 14 for 100. 30 for 200. Like I said they’re ten a piece from me, but I bet you can get 15 or even 20 around here. Even at ten, though, you’re making a pretty stash for yourself. Hit me up. You got my number.”\\n\\t“Aight. Sounds good, yo.” I clap my hands and rock forward in my seat. \\n\\tBefore Sal gets out, he does that cocky thing where dudes throw their chin back at Beth. He asks her what she’s doing with the Junky Vonnegut. She looks at me frowning and shrugging.\\n\\t“What?”\\n\\t“You never told her?” Sal asks.\\n\\t“There’s nothing to tell her.” I say. \\n\\t“Now there is. Tell me.” Beth says.\\n\\t“It’s nothing. Stupid.” I say.\\n\\t“So, when I was in rehab with this guy,” he points to me with his lips and his chin, “Your boy, here, he was always running around with this book in his hand.”\\n\\t“What book?” She asks.\\n\\t“What is it called, again?” Sal asks me.\\n\\t“Breakfast of Champions. The best book ever written.” I say plainly.\\n\\t“Yeah, The Breakfast of Champions. Haha. This guy tells me he wants to be a writer and that he’s obsessed with the author of the book.”\\n\\tBeth looks back and forth at us. She doesn’t get it. “So?”\\n\\t“So, the guy’s name is Vonnegut, right?”\\n\\t“Yeah. Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.” I say.\\n\\t“Yeah. That. Anyway. I say to him, maybe you can’t be this guy but you can be like the Junky Vonnegut or something. Everyone called him the Junky Vonnegut that. He was so crazy. It took him three weeks to start wearing shoes.” Sal laughs. “You never told her about that?”\\n\\t“No.” \\nSal can’t understand why. He shakes his head and laughs some more. We bump knuckles. He tells Beth his name and asks for hers. Then, he opens the door, closes it and limps away.  I pull the stash out and take the rubber band off and hand one to Beth. She holds it up to her nose and inhales with her eyes closed. She moans. \\n“The Junky Vonnegut, huh?” She rolls her eyes.\\n“Yeah.”\\n“Stupid.”\\n\\t“I know. What I said. I don’t think he even gets that it’s an inside joke.”\\nShe nods.\\n“You got works?” I ask.\\n\\t“No.” She says. “I got a few bucks, though.” Beth gets out and jogs for the door closest to the pharmacy. The toddler looks at me and reaches out to give me a few soggy Goldfish.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n13\\n\\nBeth sings with the radio all the way back to her place. \\t\\n\\n\\tExcept for a few minutes when she parks outside of her sister’s place and takes the kid inside to leave with her for a few hours. There’s silence for a bit, but when she gets back in the car, Hotel California is playing. Beth sings the lyrics passionately and plays some air drums. She even does the guitar solos with her mouth. It’s pretty terrible, but she’s excited about the dope we got, and I kind of have myself to blame for her singing. I told her she was a good singer once. I can’t remember what song it was playing when I did, but it was sadder and softer and she had more control of her voice. Now, she blows notes that are flat and out of key at the top of her lungs and looks at me, wiggling her eyebrows and striking diva poses for a laugh. She thinks I like it. I smile back at her.\\n\\t\\n\\tWhen we make it up the stairs to her apartment, she gets a glass of water and two spoons. I toss my pack of smokes onto the coffee table and the bag with the other baggies inside of it. I pull my sweatshirt and shirt over my head and toss it on the couch next to me.  Beth and I have never done drugs together. We know a lot of the same people, but our knowledge of each other is strictly chemical free. \\nGetting high with someone for the first time is a special thing. It’s like the first time a girl undresses for you with the lights on and you see the things you've never seen or that time your uptight math teacher with the crucifix and long skirts put on some jeans and cut up with the other teachers on a field trip to the local wildlife preserve, like it’s a different person altogether. And Beth delivers. It is every bit as intimate as making love.\\n\\n\\nWe drop water onto the powder in our spoons. We suck it up into our syringes. She wears a stained white tank top and wipes the crook of her arm with an alcohol swab. Beth pulls the looped leather belt tight before she starts poking herself. There are already a few bruises and red specked freckles in the crook of her arm. The skin on mine only has the purple, leathery divot of old scar tissue. My vein is fat beneath that. The needle is sharp. A black blood flower blooms in my syringe and disappears. \\nI swallow hard. She sighs with hard lungs right behind me. Then, we sit in silence, letting the tingle crush us, our arms and legs and shoulders and necks. I lean back on the couch and throw my hands up above my head. It’s hazy after that. We sleep. The womb of our goddess is warm. We are birthed and reborn. We slumber. We suckle at our mother’s bosom. She is all that we need. She is all that we want. \\n\n",

There’s something about brain chemistry when you sedate it with something like heroin and remove the sedative, even just once. The brain’s natural energy and thought life feels unnatural and over stimulated. \\n\\nI have this black antique fan in my room about four feet high. It used to squeak, but a few weeks after I brought it home, it stopped. Just quit spinning all together. The engine hums when I flip the switch like it’s trying, but the blades don’t move. Now, it just sits there in the corner of my room. I’ve wanted to fix it ever since. I really have, but it’s always broken, so I can never see the point. I’m anxious. I’m depressed, and, suddenly, an impromptu remodel of my room seems like a great idea. I swing the fan like a maul. The base of the fan puts several large holes into the sheetrock, holes shaped like gumdrops when you look at them from the side. I’m breathing hard and breaking a sweat and my muscles kind of burn, so I stop and walk out to the living room.\\n\\nDale’s not home, which is a good thing. He’ll be pretty pissed when he sees what I did in my room. Kind of wish I hadn’t, now. He’ll be pissed when he finds out I relapsed, too. Once he comes back it’s over, but I don’t know when he’ll be back. The guy doesn’t even have a real job. No. He collects SSI checks for being a mental case and shops thrift stores to buy and resell items on the internet. It could be hours, or it could be minutes before he comes back. So, I’m in the living room with my hands in my pockets and the curtains drawn, and I’m literally kicking the ground. I walk to one side of the room and stick my toe into the carpet a few times, like I’m checking to see if the floor is still under there. It is. Then, I walk to the other side and do the same thing. The floor's still there. Eventually, I sit down to write out my options and make a list of pros and cons for each.\\n\\n\\nThere are three thing I can do, as I see it, three things for people like me who are in a bad way and whose lives are going nowhere. One. I can look up a local cult and join. Two. I can join the French Foreign Legion, if that even still exists. Three. I can go balls to the wall with my addiction. Suicide is a fourth option, but items number two and three are suicide in a round about way. So, I have all three written down on a piece of paper and three T graphs, with the words pros and cons written on each side.\\n\\nI start with joining a cult. Cults like to hug a lot. That’s a con. I write it in that column. They also take care of everything. They even tell you what to think. That’s mostly a pro, but it’s also a con. Then, before I write any more it hits me that each pro and each con on these lists will need its own list of pros and cons itself and on for infinity, so I give up and go over it all in my head, instead. Cults like to hug a lot and won’t teach me acquire tools for daily life, once I leave, if I ever leave. Don’t like it. The French Foreign Legion would help me get stronger and feel like a man. I might also get a bayonet stuck in my throat while I’m sleeping on a cot with malaria in some African village. Always a possibility with the French Foreign Legion. That’s if they even accept me. Not feeling that, either. Finally, it’s going back to what I know, what feels most natural. Dope. There are no pros to this one, but it’s what I know.    \\n\n",

meeting we gather around an old bench and two coffee cans on the ground.\\n\\nThey are half filled with gravel. Once soggy cigarette butts sit smashed and brown on top of the rocks inside of them. We puff on our smokes. I am down to four cigarettes a day. One before work. One at lunch. One after the meeting. One before bed, but on the weekends, I smoke more. There’s just not as much to do.\\n\\nSome of us sit. Some of us stand with our backs to the red brick wall of the church’s covered walkway. Jerry chugs sugar free Red Bull from a tall silver can in the dark. He turns to me and speaks. His breath is combustible and chemically sweetened, fed by fumes of the artificial poisons bubbling in his guts.\\n\\n“So, it’s been a journey, man. I’m just stoked to see it all.” An image of the neighbor girl’s white breasts jiggling on the living room rug and her shaking the orange bottle of pills like a maraca flashes in my head. Then, it is Sal limping off the Sounder earlier that morning saying he will see me tomorrow with a dub of fire. Number four. And the Junky Vonnegut is getting some for free.\\n\\nJerry pulls hard on his on his cigarette. His cheeks collapse around his teeth. The cherry ember glows orange and lights his face. He continues, but now, he speaks words made of smoke.\\n\\n“Two years is an amazing feat, dude. Really, not many get there if you consider all the people who have ever tried to get sober. Almost none. Be proud of yourself.”\\n\\n“Thanks. I am,” proud of what? I’m not sure. I just know it’s the right response.\\n\\n“Call me tomorrow.”\\n\\n“Why? Won’t you be here?”\\n\\n“Nah. I got some work to take care of. Won’t be off in time for the meeting.” Jerry says.\\n\\n“Okay. See ya.” He walks off.\\n\\nAnother guy I know from the meeting taps me on the shoulder. He says he has tickets for a Mariner’s game next weekend and wants to know if I’d be interested in going. I tell him yes. We exchange numbers and walk our separate ways.\n",

                                         \\n\\nFall is coming.\\n\\nEarly morning faces stare into cell phone screens like magical handheld portals. Many wear still wet hair and smell of toothpaste. Some carry briefcases or bookbags. One boy sings along with whatever is playing in his headphones, and another smells of cheap aerosol cologne. A young mother addresses her small children wearing their school uniforms. We wobble along the tracks. There is the digital recording of a woman’s voice letting us know which station is next. The brakes let out their empty metal howl, and we float forward in our seats. We fall back into them. Sometimes, I look up to see who is getting on and who is getting off. Mostly, I read.\\n\\n20 minutes before it is my turn to get off the train, someone is standing over me. I ignore the shadow, hoping to find a better place to let off reading in the book. A familiar voice gargles through a thin film of phlegm above me. The words are warm.\\n\\n“Well, if it ain’t the Junky Vonnegut.”\\n\\nOnly one person calls me that. My friend Sal.\\n\\n“Well, if it ain’t old Salamander Sal come to terrorize the masses this morning. How’re ya doing?” I’m the only one who has ever called him Salamander.\\n\\n“Are you really reading that again?”\\n\\n“Yeah. I am. Look.” I hold the book out so that he can read the reviews on the cover. “It says he very nearly levitates. Don’t you think that might be worth reading once or twice?”\\n\\n“Whatever man. You’re crazy.” He shakes his head. “It’s good you like it. I just ain’t ever liked a book that much.” Sal flashes a smile to reveal the kinds of gaps between his teeth that I associate with a certain brand of Latin American masculinity. I’m not sure where I ever got that idea. But, there it is.\\n\\n“Yup. Yup. And where’ve ya been? Ain’t seen ya at any meetings lately.”\\n\\n“Dee Dee. Man. Said she was tired of that meeting at the church. Said it’s too sad and depressing. Too many old people. Said it’s time to find a different one.” The last time I saw her was at a meeting. She spent the whole hour trying to open a bag of Sour Patch Kids. It was difficult for her to do. She kept falling asleep while she was standing up.\\n\\n“Where you go now?”\\n\\n“I don’t know. Haven’t been in a minute.”\\n\\n“Oh, no!”\\n\\n“Yeah.” He laughs. “And how you doing?”\\n\\n“Good.” Memories of the last two weekends at the neighbor’s apartment with her grandmother’s bottle of Xanax make an unwanted appearance in my mind. “Yeah. I’m doing good, man. On the suboxone program.”\\n\\n“Cool. How long? You been on subs since rehab?”\\n\\n“Yeah. Coming up on two years here soon.”\\n\\n“Has it been that long?”\\n\\n“Two years for me in two weeks and a day.”\\n\\n“Wow. That’s awesome, bro. I’m proud of you. Done better than me.”\\n\\n“Yeah.” I shrug and shake my head.\\n\\n“So you ain’t messing around then, huh?”\\n\\nI stare at his arm. The world and sounds around me fade. There are gnarled knots of chicken bone gristle and tendrils of scar tissue holding him together inside. Under his clothes the unsightly webs of paper bag flesh cover half of his body. Part of my mind wanders back to the memory of Sal sitting across from me in the small air conditioned office with six other men while he stared down and recounted the night he turned 21. Our beady eyed counselor held his clipboard and nodded his head. Sal told us about losing his scholarship to play college baseball. He told us how his girlfriend lost her life. We all saw the reptilian skin grafts when he got out the shower at night, but now, he sees me looking at his mangled wrist and hand. He quietly moves his arm back behind himself.\\n\\n“What?” I look up at him.\\n\\n“You ain’t messing around then?” Sal asks again.\\n\\n“Nah.” I don’t mean to say anything else, but the second part is a slip. “Not really.”\\n\\n“Not really? Or yeah, you are? Cuz last I checked, not really means yeah.” Sal smiles.\\n\\n“I’m not getting high.” That is the truth. Two weekends on Xanax is not something I plan to continue, even if it has ruined my sobriety date. I’m not doing heroin. I’m not getting high.\\n\\n“Too bad.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“I said that that is too bad, man.”\\n\\n“Too bad what?”\\n\\n“You won’t get to try this fire.” Sal’s never been a junky. His vices are women and alcohol.\\n\\n“Fire?”\\n\\n“Yeah. You know I won’t mess with it. I just need someone to tell me if it is as good as it’s supposed to be.”\\n\\n“What’s it supposed to be?”\\n\\n“Number four.”\\n\\n“Number four like the movies?”\\n\\n“Yessir.”\\n\\n“Man. No way you’re getting real number four. You know these streets. We're on the west coast. It’s all black out here.”\\n\\n“Seen a stamped kilo, man, at my boy’s place just last night. White powder. Vietnamese cats.”\\n\\n“White powder?” I take a moment to think on it. “Well, what about Dee Dee?”\\n\\n“Dee Dee? Man, you know I love her. I don’t need her any crazier than she is already. Bro, she’s a junky worse than you.”\\n\\nI stick my thumb in my chest. “I’m not a junky.”\\n\\nWe both laugh at that.\\n\\n“Seriously, though, Sal. I’m not using. It ain’t like that.”\\n\\n“You’re on subs.”\\n\\n“So?”\\n\\n“So. You wake up everyday and run to that medicine cabinet and take that pill, just like you used to wake up everyday and call your dude for your fix. Same thing. Besides. Last I heard, the sub program runs a pretty penny.”\\n\\nI had nothing to say. Without the state insurance I got from living on the street and going to rehab as an indigent, I couldn’t afford it. Still, my life is way better on subs than it ever was on heroin.\\n\\n“What you say, man? You wanna try some of that good good?”\\n\\n“Maybe.” I slump again in my seat. He catches my smirk.\\n\\n“Yeah.” Sal nods, excited. “Yeah. You do.”\\n\\nWe sit in silence. Another station is announced. The train stops. People get off. People get on. He waits for me to ask him or volunteer myself for the experiment. Minutes pass.\\n\\n“Look, man, tell ya what.” He lowers his voice. “You gonna be on the train tomorrow?”\\n\\n“Yeah.”\\n\\n“Then, I’m a throw you a dub of that fire for free.”\\n\\n“You know what they say, Sal. The first one’s always free.” I refuse eye contact with him.\\n\\n“This one is. But, it can be your last too. You ain’t gotta be a junky.”\\n\\n“Sure.” I shake my head.\\n\\nThe voice announces the next station over the speakers.\\n\\n“This is my stop.” He limps toward the doors. He descends the stairs and looks back. “Don’t forget, Junky Vonnegut! Tomorrow. Same train. Same time.” Like I would forget. \\n\\nThrough the window, hushed halos of copper light hang over the passing neighborhood streets. They sit silent in the shade or see the soft steps of family members dispersing for the day. Forrest fire smoke pollutes the air from other states, and the distant silver dollar sun wears an orange wreath hovering on the horizon. It is warm on my face. Soon, that incandescent orb will be sitting in places and lighting the sky in ways that make me anxious. Soon, the dog days will be a memory I long for, lost inside of me somewhere.\n",



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           As much as I’d like to tell you the half ounce of that potent brown powder lasted as long as it should have, it didn’t. Rufus and I tore into it every time we woke up from a nod. Worse than that though between the two of us, one would always brag about the quality. If he didn’t brag about how good our dope was to some poor street junkie cooking up the typical vinegary, black goo in the bottom half of a coke can or spoon on the sidewalk, then I did. We traded hits for packs of cigarettes or five bucks or meth we didn’t really want or pills we didn’t need. So, sooner than it should have been, it was gone. \\n\\nThe morning after it ran out we sat in the park and did some of the dilaudid and morphine we’d obtained. It was the last day of the month. We’d have food stamps to trade soon, but until then, we would be bored and wait for someone to come along with a lick for us to hit or something to pass the time. Soon enough, Black Irish walked up to us.\\n\\nNow, Black Irish was neither black nor was he Irish, at least not so far as I could tell. He looked like a Nazi after the war who had let his hair grow out. Our interaction with him was always the same. He offered us rancid protein shakes in bottles he’d purchased at 42 cents a bottle from the discount grocery store, where a package of deli cut turkey breast might look more like a package of green roast beef. That was Black Irish’s thing. Well, it was one of his things.\\n\\nHe also liked to tell people how much he loved them. Sometimes, he would mix his proclamation of love towards you in with veiled threats to your safety, but he said it a lot. It was part of the Christian community he was in and out of it so frequently, a rehab church. He was a self-appointed leader there and disciple maker when he wasn’t relapsing. Eventually, he started saying that he’d been called to teach other men how to relapse and come back from it. Black Irish was always angry, walking around with two clenched fists like hammer heads and gritting his teeth, but out of some religious duty, he always told us he loved us. Usually, he was fasting from food or subjecting himself to humiliating employment as penance he decided God had decided for him to do. It never made sense. That’s how it was with him, though. \\n\\nRufus and I had just lit cigarettes. Black Irish stood at our feet looking down at us. He eyed our cigarettes and licked his lips. His fists clenched, and he said, \\n\\n“Hey, guys. I love you.”\\n\\n“Hey, Black Irish.” We responded trying to hide our disappointment in having to talk to him.\\n\\n“How’s it going?”\\n\\n“We’re doing alright.” I never asked him how he was. \\n\\n“Good. I’m happy for you. Well, yeah, I’m doing pretty good myself.” I rolled my eyes. I didn’t want to know. “Just, you know, got back to my ministry at Hope Outreach downtown.”\\n\\n“Yeah. We know where it is.”\\n\\n“Good. Good. You guys should come down sometime. I sure do love you guys. Would love to see you come in and come to a service.” He grunted as the visceral hatred he held in his guts towards us tried to escape his mouth. “Really…really love you guys.”\\n\\n“Maybe. Yeah. You know, what? That sounds nice. Maybe we’ll come see you there soon.” Rufus piped in.\\n\\n“Okay! Looking forward to it.”\\n\\n“Okay.”\\n\\n“Hey. I have a pair of movie tickets here, but I can’t go to it. Would you guys want to go see it?”\\n\\n“Guess so. What is it?”\\n\\n“Something about a mine in Alaska or something and women being mistreated there.”\\n\\n“Jeesh. A lighthearted flick, huh?”\\n\\n“Here.” He handed us the tickets. “Love you guys. See ya.”\\n\\n“K. See ya.” Rufus said.\\n\\nWe walked up to the movie theater. The entrance was part of an outdoor plaza in the mall. There was a large grassy hill where people sat. Kids played with bouncy balls, and parents lay on blankets. Rufus busted out a sticky brown roach and lit it. He took a few puffs, blew the smoke up and passed it to me.\\n\\n“Maybe we shouldn’t smoke here. There’s kids.”\\n\\n“Nah..” He was holding the smoke in and talking. “Nah. Just smoke it. We’ll be done in a second.”\\n\\nI shrugged. I took a few puffs. Before I could pass it back, I realized the smoke was blowing right towards the families and their kids. Rufus busted up in a fit of coughing. I followed, watery snot spraying out of my nose with the thick grey smoke plumes.  It burned like fire in the back of my nostrils.  We coughed hard. The parents of the children looked at us and shook their heads. \\n\\nEventually, we stopped coughing and walked into the theatre. A nerdy high school kid took our tickets and told us where the auditorium was. We had no money for soda and popcorn or any of that, but we did have a 200 milligram Kadian. Rufus and I went to the bathroom. He pulled out a pack of cigarettes and took the cellophane off it. I opened the turquoise gel cap and poured the time release beads into the clear plastic that Rufus was holding open. He pulled out his lighter and crushed the beads against the stall divider. We poured the granulated powder into a cooker, dropped water on it and sucked it back up, half and half. \\n\\nA flower of black blood bloomed through the milky morphine mixture in my syringe and disappeared back into the vein from which it came. We grunted simultaneously at the rush. I rubbed my face and capped my rig. It wasn’t a new one, so the needle got caught on the orange plastic cap and bent badly. Rufus watched it happen.\\n\\n“Dang! Looks like that one’s spent.”\\n\\n“Yeah. Huh? I’ve used worse.” There were at least six broken needles in my arms. There were seven before that. One had worked itself to the surface so that I could pick it out. The thing is that when they break and you try to grab them, your skin and fat pushes back up and swallows it before you can get it. I smiled and shrugged, dramatically throwing it into the toilet before I flushed it. We laughed and walked out.\\n\\nIn the theater, Rufus found a half-eaten box of popcorn that was cold and soggy. He also rounded up a few old beverages people left behind and mixed them together in the biggest cup. Rufus said it was flat and watery, maybe a mixture of Sprite, root beer and diet Coke. He wasn’t sure. But took long pulls of it through the straw between chewing the popcorn. The trailers started.\\n\\nI always liked trailers more than movies. They were shorter. They were more action packed and emotionally stirring than the actual feature films. In high school, I realized that movies worth watching were few and far between. Movies didn’t do it for me. Most of the time, I was rooting for the good guys to fail and die so I could just go home and start mourning the $11.50 I’d wasted to see it as soon as possible. The sooner I started grieving it, the sooner I’d be over it. \\n\\nCinematic features had other problems, though, in my eyes. They were terribly unrealistic. And even when the storylines were relatable, I couldn’t stop thinking about how the actors were just acting. I’d heard about how partnerships or love stories on screen were actually terrible rivalries behind the scenes. They weren’t friends or in love. Like my life back when I used to go to the movies, before I went back to the streets, it was all fake. That was the most realistic thing about it. People pretended to be friends. They pretended to care. They pretended their lives mattered, and as I sat there watching that movie with Rufus, this was what I thought about. I didn’t have to worry about him being fake. He was broken like me. He stunk like me. He was filthy like me, but Rufus was also real. Rufus was my friend. He slept through the whole thing. \\n\\nWhen we got out of the movie we walked up to see Ally Alcoholic. She was sitting on her bench. Rufus was getting sweet on her like he always did. He asked her if she had a clean, which she did. She gave it over, and we walked back to the spot to do whatever pill we decided to when we got there. It hit me then, the things I’d forgotten for over a week. I needed to break it to Rufus that he had to stop talking to her. I wondered how’d he take it. Would he accept it? He had to, or we’d be in big trouble. There was no second option. The Faceless One had ordered it. \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I was selling prebagged packages of crack, black tar and cocaine for Des and Sneaks in that apartment behind Baskin and Robbins. That was the place Mike got us in Fall of 2010, and once we moved in, he lost his mind. Mike said the neighbor’s dogs were talking to him. That’s when he was talking to Danielle on Facebook, and she messaged me, talking to me about all the different ways she was a pervert. She had a girlfriend. She was on house arrest. \\n\\nI sold to all kinds of people. The redhead who liked to smoke her dope and tell me she was on her way over hours before she came would spend the night. One night, she watched me count the money I owed Des and Sneaks over and over just to throw it into the air and do another bag out of merchandise I would have to answer for the next day. I think I cried that night. \\n\\nThe landlords had totally furnished the place. It had a big flat screen, a washer and dryer, dishes and utensils, couches and beds, literally anything a place should have, it had. They let Mike and me move in with just a few rules. No drugs. No smoking inside. Be clean. No visitors all hours of the day and night. No loud music. Well, the first time they came to see how things were going, it was because there was a hitchhiker the redhead had picked up the night before blasting the Dead on YouTube and dancing in the living room. There were old tuna cans and plates stinky plates of moldy food all over the counters. All of them had at least a few cigarette buts in them. Mike, the redhead, myself and the stranger dancing in the living room were all obviously under the influence of some hard chemicals. And while they were visiting I had to go outside to reup with my dealers parked in the driveway. Not to mention, before and after that, the place had a ton of traffic. \\n\\nThere was the guy who was like 30. He always had benzos and a beautiful blonde wife who worked at one of the local bars. Their son was only three. The guy always had him when he was hustling prints of his artwork in the grocery store parking lots. One day, he went to rehab. When he got out, he overdosed and died. I told his wife I was sorry about that while she was waitressing. She thanked me.  \\n\\nOne of my other customers was known for being a scum bag, a heroin addict like me and a scumbag like me, but he’d grown up in town, so his infamy existed in circles that didn’t even know who I was. He’s the guy who shot my dog, and as much as I’d like to pretend that my dealings with him ended after he did that, they didn’t. He always needed me to score for him or sell to him. I always needed someone to middleman. His gaze had grown dull and speech faded from too many years of Suboxone and opiate addiction. And as scummy as he was, he was engaged to a beautiful girl who didn’t even smoke pot. They had a baby on the way. It was curious that she was even in town with the rest of us where nothing was ever happening and everyone was poor and criminal and addicted. There she was though. \\n\\nThe morning his child was being born, literally the very moments of his birth, the father came to see me. He was sick. He needed a bag, but I was out. That’s what his addiction had brought him to. His child was being born in the hospital, and he was knocking on my window for a 20 piece. I can’t pretend that it would have been any different if I was in his situation. Later, after I got kicked out of that place, which wasn’t long after that, and Mike was still living there, he came to the house and cleaned it out. They took everything but the refrigerator, washer and dryer. Mike got blamed for it. I just laughed when I heard about it. By then, I was too busy running around with Danielle to care.    \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Now, it may seem hard to believe that I would have been able to hide my whole body under the pillows on the bed, but remember, everything in the apartment was over sized, like it all belonged to a giant. There were even bigger throw pillows besides. When the owner of the place returned to his room, I could see the giant from under them. He wore a tan colored trench coat which he stripped off as soon as he entered the bedroom and sat with his back to me. He watched TV. There seemed to be no neck. Fuzzy strands of hair stuck out from the cratered back of his skull. The man wore a gown of his own flesh, which hung in ugly folds of white skin, and an even worse smell seemed to emanate from whatever strange bacterial cultures I imagined to be growing under those flaps of fat. The white comforter seemed visibly soiled anywhere his naked skin touched it. *This is what I get.* I thought. *This is what I get for doing meth with Chandra and letting Rufus talk me into running into some strange, stinky room.* It also occurred to me that most people wouldn't ever find themselves in a situation like this just because they went to an office party.  No.  This kind of ridiculousness was unique to life with Rufus.\\n\\nHe pulled a box from under the bed and produced two plastic dolls. The TV played in front of him. His silhouette played with the figurines. It was as unsettling and strange an event as I have ever witnessed in my life. The giant man began to speak for the figurines. One had a cockney accent and the other spoke with the voice of a girl in high school. There was conversation about the things they were wearing and plans for later. It was just the kind of thing you’d expect to see a child doing privately in their playroom, but it was this middle aged colossal cretin.\\n\\nI would have laughed, but he passed gas, which was so revolting that I immediately began to gag. My body went limp. It was like this time I got food poisoning from this box of chow Mein an old lady gave me only this was worse. And whatever ability the gargantuan man had to articulate imaginary conversations between his Ken and Barbie dolls seemed to be lost as he pulled back the pillows to find me spewing vomit the consistency of creamy oatmeal onto the floor. He let out an angry bellow. He shouted wet and gargled words I couldn’t understand. He grabbed my hair. My body came up off the mattress like he was picking up a piece of clothing.\\n\\nI tried to fight. I was too weak though and too sick. The smell of his fart had started me gagging and the smells in the rest of the apartment were now causing an involuntary retching which they hadn’t before. We ended up in the kitchen. He smashed the cabinet doors with my head. At some point he threw me on the ground, opened the refrigerator door and toppled it over onto me. Jars of jelly and old cardboard containers of rotten take out fell on me. Then, he picked me up by the neck. Just one of his hands held me up against the wall slowly choking me to death, but he let out an angry shout like some mythological creature who lived under a bridge. His breath led to more puke. It poured out of my nose. I swallowed some of it and struggled to breathe.\\n\\nIt’s funny the things you think about when your life’s being taken from you. There I was dying slowly as this man choked me to death. The place smelled terrible. I was pretty sure that I’d crapped my pants a little bit. It was an embarrassing scenario and an even more embarrassing way to die, but my mind kept telling me that there was honey spilled down my back and in my hair. I don’t think I ever told you that about me, but sticky things, like jelly or syrup or honey on my skin, drive me absolutely crazy. It was like whatever part of my brain that hated it so much was completely uninterested in my imminent death and only cared about getting that stickiness off my skin. Brains are weird like that.\\n\\nBefore all oxygen flow to my brain was cut and my eyes closed, Rufus smiled from over my opponent’s shoulder. He held a frying pan. He opened his eyes wide and the dull thud of cast iron against the back of my assailant’s skull let out in the kitchen. The giant crumpled to the ground. It took us a few minutes to get out of there, because somehow, I’d gotten stuck under him when we fell. We left the loot we’d originally intended to steal and stopped to collect ourselves once we got back to the freedom and fresh air on the streets.\\n\\nI pulled my pack of cigarettes out. All but two had been broken or gotten wet with all the food and vomit in the fight. Rufus took them from me. He lit them and passed on back to me. We sat on the curb smoking.\\n\\n“SHHHEEEEWOOOOO!!!!” He said giggling.\\n\\n“I know.”\\n\\n“Man, oh, man!”\\n\\n“That was nuts!”\\n\\n“I know.”\\n\\n“We’ll be telling that story for years.”\\n\\nIt was getting to be midnight, so we walked back up to our spot. We passed a fat man in a brand-new rain poncho and combat boots. The man banged a staff like Gandolf and demanded drugs from passersby. Everyone knew he was a cop, and no one messed with him. The streets are like that. There’s some unspoken release of information dispersed among us about undercovers and the like, the same way bees all know how to act in unison. They don’t talk. They just know, and so did we.\\n\\nBack at the spot Rufus and I did our shots. We nodded. Before the sun came up, the cops were kicking me in the leg and telling us we had to go.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                I sat up. “I’m not crying.” I said.\\n\\nHe told me he was sick. I forgot all about the Faceless One and Ally Alcoholic and everything Jimbo told me. Rufus had been through booking the day before and once he was booked they released him. A big city like that doesn’t have the resources to keep people jailed for minor things. The warrant was for an old shoplifting ticket and an unpaid fine. It wasn’t ever getting paid. The city knew that. We knew that. That’s just how it was. Next time they saw Rufus and recognized him, they’d run his name, and he’d go to jail again to be booked and released.\\n\\nI showed him what I’d gotten from Jimbo and Fin the day before for Bug’s eye. He ran in place and let out a giddy laugh. It took him a few minutes to fix it all up, but once he did, he told me we were going to an office party that evening.\\n\\n“An office party?”\\n\\n“Yeah. Fat Channy wants us to go.” Those were his last words before he fell asleep. When the cops came I already had him over my shoulder and was walking across the street to the park where we usually spent the first parts of our days.\\n\\nChandra, or Fat Channy as we called her, had been off the streets for the last 9 months. There was no need for her to have that nickname, as there weren’t any other Chandras or Channys around to differentiate from. She was fat though and didn’t seem to mind. In the summertime she wore sleeveless dresses, so you could see where she’d been damaged in a fiery car wreck on the freeway years before. Paper bag flesh covered the unsightly striations and knots of scar tissue like chicken bone gristle holding her together inside. She wore braces made of metal rods and black Velcro. Most of her face had been left intact but for the crenulate trough of missing meat running from her neck and up into the cheek where veins and tendons had been borrowed. She looked lonely and hurt. Her eyes were kind and teeth pretty the few times she ever smiled.\\n\\nWe first started seeing her come around Pill Hill year or so before, always trying to trade or sell her Ativan and Vicodin for something better. On top of the accident, she’d been born with some disease the details of which were unclear but that’d given her rights to a lifetime supply of prescriptions for low grade pain killers and anxiety meds and antidepressants. She liked heroin and did meth sometimes. Unlike us though, she could keep an apartment and job. Her visits to the streets were always desperate but short lived. She never spent the night.\\n\\nBut somehow someone talked her into smoking crack. That was it for her. She’d kept her life together while using for some time, but less than a week after she hit the rock, she was living outside like the rest of us. Her health got worse. Rufus and I adopted her as a third in our party for a short while and pushed her new wheelchair for her. One day, her father came to get her. He put her in rehab. She’d gotten a job as a secretary and lived in a halfway house. We were her only friends and would now be her guests at the party for her office.\\n\\nIt was a regular day for us. Rufus nodded out. We sat on the sidewalk or on benches. When he was awake our heads swiveled on our necks back and forth like spectators at a tennis match. We watched the passing pedestrians. The city offered so much for us to see in a single sitting. There was a transsexual in red, horsehair extensions and Dorothy’s blue checkered dress from the Wizard of Oz and black leather combat boots. A street artist painted for a crowd. Another played drums on empty five-gallon buckets. Pigeons scavenged the sidewalks as dirty and desperate as we were. There were strange conversations. A 50-year-old man cried into his phone that his mother was too mean, that he wouldn’t give her this kind of power any more. The prettiest girl we saw that day wore face paint and talked to herself. Rufus drooled. He nodded. I bought a pack of Reds, which was half gone in a couple of hours. As the day cooled off and evening approached, Rufus woke up for good. He was ready to go to the party. We walked towards the address.\\n\\n“Now, when we get there, Boom Boom. We have to look normal. Ya know? Channy’s supposed to be doing well and all that, and she is, but you know, people like her coworkers, straight laced types don’t expect people like us to be coming to their parties. It’s vital that we seem as normal as is possible, my dear Boom Boom.”\\n\\nI shook my head. “I know, Roof. I know. What’s that?”\\n\\nHe was bringing what looked like a Xanax bar to his lips with his fingers. “Xanax.”\\n\\n“WHAT? After everything you just said?” This was Rufus’s super power. We all had superhuman powers as street addicts. Not that they were particularly helpful or did anything but hurt us, but they were things most humans couldn’t accomplish. Like this, with Rufus, the ability to hold within himself such glaring contradictions in thought, word and deed simultaneously and to be at such peace about it was extraordinary. He would have been a great cartoon character.\\n\\nNeedless to say, the party was a disaster for the first hour we were there. Not because of me though. Obviously, our grease caked pores and the raggedy seams of the fabric on our clothes and bags made our homelessness and drug addiction hard to hide. Fat Channy had been giving me worried looks as soon as she saw us. Perhaps she never considered how awkward it would be to have us there. But there we were. Rufus would try to hide his nods by picking up random objects and holding them to his face, like he was reading or studying them. He nodded off mid conversation with Chandra’s boss. From time to time I heard him telling the partygoers about how his last girlfriend had ripped him off or asking what they thought about how hard it was to find a public restroom in the city anymore. He didn’t realize that these were problems homeless drug addicts have. Regular people didn’t have these issues. Later, he tried to cut a piece of cheesecake. It wasn’t because he wanted to eat it. He just knew it was what people did at parties and was doing his best to look normal. Channy and I watched horrified. The piece Rufus cut was a lopsided square from the middle of the cake. He nodded out in the middle of transferring it to his plate and stood asleep in the way of everyone who came to get something from the drink and food bar.\\n\\nEventually, though, everyone was drunk. No one was lucid enough to notice or care that Rufus and I were obviously street people. Chandra didn’t feel embarrassed by it. Strings of lights kept the place dim and set the mood. Brains saturated in ethyl alcohol let loose from their lips low toned and lustful murmurings. Channy sat next to me on the couch. I put my arm around her, and she put her head on my shoulder. There was a stifled outburst of snorting laughter from another room. The cold metal rods of her leg brace pushed into my knee. Rufus had disappeared.\\n\\nChanny whispered to me. “I got some meth.”\\n\\n“What?” I shook my head. As cold and calloused as the streets were and as ruthless and ridiculous as I’d become, I had no desire to watch this girl throw her life away again. Maybe it was an attachment developed from all that time we pushed her wheelchair around. Or maybe it was a latent affection for the hope she gave me. She got off the streets. She was sober and had a job.\\n\\nFat Channy wasn’t well, though. She could die if she started using again, but she was persistent. It was all we knew of each other and the means of our closest bonding. We locked the door to the bathroom and put the lid on the toilet down. She pulled out the bag and an old Kohl’s credit card to crush it up and snort. She bowed before it and pulled some into her nostrils. Then, I did. After that, I told her about my heroin. She insisted even harder than before that I share, which I did. Channy puked in the toilet.\\n\\nIt was getting late, and as we walked back out into the party, I wondered where Rufus had disappeared to. The front door opened. He walked in and whispered to me.\\n\\n“I gotta show you something.” He was staring at a drunk man in a nice button up shirt and loosened tie dancing by himself in the middle of the party. Everyone else had either left or slumbered in each other’s arms or made out.\\n\\nWe walked through the halls and up the stairs a few stories and came out on a level that had apartments. Apparently, he’d been prowling and ended up in one of them. Channy stayed back. That was the last we saw of her for a while. Rufus came to the door. He stooped and looked at me wide eyed with his pointer finger on his lips. He said it had been unlocked.\\n\\nInside the first thing I noticed was an unbearable stench. We crept around. Everything in the apartment seemed to be disproportionately large. The living room was covered in a foot or more of empty tallboys. There were smears of feces and blood on the floor which had been sprinkled over with sawdust rather than cleaned up. A bowl of fruit loops had been shattered against the wall. The cereal stuck solidified to the wall and floor. Grey colored bathwater sat an inch below a ring of grime on the tub. A giant pair of white briefs with thick brown streaks in the seat sat wrinkled on the floor by the toilet. Rufus pulled me into the bedroom and pointed to a piece of gold bullion on a mantle above the head of the bed. I jumped onto the bed. It was higher than most other beds I’d been on. It was also perfectly made and clean, unlike everything else in the apartment. The extra soft mattress, or maybe it was a waterbed, and comforter made it almost impossible to crawl across it. I was stuck.\\n\\nI turned to Rufus and tried to tell him, but before I spoke, the front door opened. It bounced off the spring stop. Someone with a gruff voice cleared their throat, and elephantine footsteps could be felt in the floor. It was whoever owned the place. They were home.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           It took her a day or so to come back, and we got close when she did. Dreezy chased her girlfriend off for being paranoid and jealous before she moved on to the next fling. I texted Danielle even though she was with another guy, and I complained about my heartache to Dreezy. Dreezy asked me if I thought she liked to hear about Danielle.\\n\\nDreezy would finally fall asleep at around 4 a.m. Sometimes earlier, but when she was out she could not be woken up. Slapping her didn’t work. Screaming was useless. We never tried pouring cold water, but it seemed doubtful that it would make any difference. It was a problem, because people wanted to buy 24/7. Most nights before she fell asleep she would send me and whoever was around with money for cigarettes, scratch tickets, grape red vines, fun dip, sour patch explodes, donuts and apple fritters, which were her favorite. She filled the grape licorice with the sugar from the fun dip and handed them out like the loaded syringes she handed out earlier in the day. Then she would pass out and wake up in the morning raging and throwing things.\\n\\nShe gave me five balloons of heroin one morning and sent me to sell them downtown, but before I took off with my bag and a long board Dreezy pulled out a huge bottle of random pills, from which I took three. I had not slept or eaten in days, and she sent me off 10 minutes later with a sweaty peck on the cheek and aggravated by how badly I was slurring my words.\\n\\nAt a store I packed bottles of cologne into my black book bag and some fabric grocery bags I had, even though I could see stout men with earpieces watching me through the glass doors. It was the fourth time I had been there to rob the place of cologne in two weeks, and it was obvious that the men were part of a sting operation set up to stop me. I kept going anyway and juggled the five heroin balloons in my mouth with my tongue on the way out. As soon as the door opened, a voice screamed,\\n\\n“STOP RIGHT THERE!!!!”\\n\\nI bolted down the street after a woman working for the store scratched my neck, and I punched her. She chased me and screamed for someone to stop me. A man with long hair grabbed my backpack, and three yellow balloons fell out of my mouth and onto the sidewalk. I broke free and skated to some festival at the park by the river. There were cops looking for me, so I took off my hat and jacket, hid the skateboard under a bridge and walked around talking to strangers. Cop cars drove by every 30 seconds looking for someone but never stopped me.\\n\\nLater I did the two balloons I had in my mouth, and after a few hours I went to see if the other balloons were still on the ground. They were, and I sold one and did the rest of them under a bridge as night fell, because I wasn’t going back to the hotel on Mcloughlin. I told Dreezy that I messed it all up when she called, and she cried,\\n\\n“Come back. I don’t care. It doesn’t matter to me. I want you back here. You are too important to me.”\n",



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Fear interrupted the rush and euphoria of the shot before I fell asleep. There was no one to watch my back while I slept with Rufus locked up. I was running a real risk of waking up stripped of everything but my underwear. I’d seen it happen to nodding junkies before. The package in my bag would be a shame to lose. Karma though. If anyone stole it they would probably overdose. The stuff was too good. It was hitting me hard, and before I fell asleep, I thought on the first time I met my redheaded friend, Rufus. \\n\\nThe blind guy who plays the melodica on the corner by Safeway every afternoon told me where I’d find him that day in late October. Sure enough. There he was, just like the blind street musician said, standing with one foot on the curb another halfway out into the deadly traffic. His shirt was off. He was sweating and screaming into what I assumed was a phone, but upon closer inspection proved to be a large and tattered blue shoe. The closer I got, the quieter he spoke. \\n\\nI wondered what kind of conversations people had on raggedy blue shoes and tried my best to hear what he was talking about or who he was talking to through the woosh of passing traffic. Who was this guy anyway? What was wrong with him? Mental illness ran rampant in the city. I was proof of that as much as he was. The content of his speech moved into strings of unintelligible grunting and desperate muttering. I think he said the name Thomas a few times. But that didn’t make sense. There couldn’t be anyone named Thomas on the other end of that shoe. That’s not how shoes work.\\n\\nIt didn’t matter to me, though. I came to score, so I caught his eye with a wave of the hand. He looked up and excused himself from the conversation on the shoe. \\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Are you Rufus?”\\n\\n“Who wants to know?”\\n\\n“Me. I got like 50 bucks. Looking for some tar.”\\n\\n“What do you mean like 50 bucks? How many bucks is that?”\\n\\n“I got 51, but I wanna get some smokes.”\\n\\n“Well. That puts you at 45 at least.”\\n\\n“K, then. I got 45 bucks.”\\n\\n“My boy does 3 for 45. He does 4 for 50. Course you’re gonna have to give me one for getting it for ya.” This was a typical street junkie’s line when copping dope for a stranger. I know because it was the kind of thing I’d said myself to different customers over the years. I was new to town. There wasn’t much I could do about it, so I decided to forfeit the Marlboros and make due with whatever snipes I could find for the night. \\n\\n“Let’s get four.”\\n\\n“You got 50 on it?” \\n\\nI nodded. \\n\\n“Let’s go.”\\n\\nWe walked down the hill. Cold air pushed through the street between the concrete walls of apartment buildings like a narrow valley of rock on a mountain. It was the first time we made that descent, and we would make it many more, every time with excitement. Along the way, Rufus dug in every trashcan we came to. He would pull out sloppy packages of checkered paper and pour slimy chunks of whatever it had once been onto the pavement and pick through it. Sometimes it was just a thin gruel. Other times, it was easier to identify, but it was always soggy and stinky. I had been on the streets plenty myself and even ate out of trashcans here and there, but only when there were other circumstances in play. For example, I watched a family of tourists throw half of a pizza into a can while it was still in the box once in another town. I snagged it up and ate it. No problem, but the things Rufus was pulling up out of these cans were no good. He wasn’t eating anything anyway. It seemed to be some sort of involuntary tick caused by too many years on the streets and too many drugs. If he saw trash, he had to dig in it. That’s just the way he was. \\n\\nWe got closer to where he was taking me. People exited the subway stations in droves. An fat faced Asian madame jaywalked. Her girls followed in fishnet and fake fur: one, two, three like ducklings after their mother. Dope boys juggled multicolored balloons in their mouths on the busy corner to junkies like us as we walked by. We lurked like skeletons of ragged bones wearing the foul rags of drug addiction stained in soot and grease and blood. Finally, Rufus addressed one leaning against a telephone post and reading a magazine. This was his guy.\\n\\nThere was a short exchange. I didn’t hear what they said, but the dope boy’s eyes darted back over Rufus’s shoulder to me and back again. They moved towards an alley. I followed, and Rufus reached his hand back behind him and held it out. I put the money in it. His guy spat one, two, three, four of the latex packages into his palm, rolled them to get some of the spit off and handed them to Rufus, who handed the money over. We walked one direction. His guy walked the other. \\n\\nRufus took me back to where he was squatting at the time. It was utility storage space under the concrete stoop of an abandoned house several miles from where we scored. It was getting dark, but I could still see well enough to fix. We melted brown morsels into tiny puddles of coffee colored magic and rolled up our sleeves. Blood flowed out, mixed and pushed back in. We itched. We scratched. \\n\\nThe place had vibes. There was a milk crate which he sat on. I sat on a shopping cart which had been flipped on it side. The walls seemed to be covered in scratches like a prison cell where the days had been counted. In the corner was a blackened blanket and tarpaulin folded up like a pillow in the dust. It got darker. Rufus lit a candle. We took turns closing our eyes and trying to put our foreheads on the ground. Between bouts of blissful sleep we talked.\\n\\n“What’s your name?” Rufus asked. \\n\\n“Clyde.”\\n\\n“Hmmm… I don’t like it.” \\n\\n“You don’t like it?” No one had ever said that before.\\n\\n“Nah. We’ll work on it. I’ll get you a better one soon.”\\n\\n“Oh.” I didn’t understand.\\n\\n“How’d you get into all of this?”\\n\\n“What? Living outside? Heroin?”\\n\\n“Yeah. All of it?”\\n\\n“Life. I guess.”\\n\\n“It’ll do that.”\\n\\n“Yeah. It will. Ya know? I had trouble as a kid. Finally got it together by the time I was 18 for a few years. I managed a call center in Nevada where I got sober. Everyday, I went to work to pay my rent and bills. The next month, I paid all the money I’d made since for rent and food and all that again. The next month, same thing. It got old. You know. My car would be on E. I’d fill it. It’d be on E in less than a week again. I washed my clothes. They got dirty. I washed them again. They got dirty. And on and on into infinity. It was too much for me. I couldn’t handle it. Eventually, I got a grease spot on my shirt and walked away from it all.”\\n\\n“Walked away, huh?”\\n\\n“Well, let it go. I quit bathing or washing or working or paying rent. I just started using again and let myself and the place go.”\\n\\n“So, a grease spot on your shirt broke you? That’s why you’re here living like this?”\\n\\n“I never thought about it like that, but yeah.”\\n\\n“No lady broke your heart or anything like that?”\\n\\n“I was engaged once.”\\n\\n“Mmhmm… What was that like?”\\n\\n“She was special.”\\n\\n“What kind of special?”\\n\\n“Special, you know, like she liked to have sex with all my friends when I was at work.”\\n\\n“Oh yeah. A real sweet heart. I know the kind, my friend.”\\n\\n“Do you?”\\n\\n“Sure do.”\\n\\n“Tell me about it.”\\n\\n“Same sorta thing. Ain’t nothing to tell really. I was a promising med student. We got married. She slept with my father. End of story.” It would be years before he told me about their daughter and how she’d died of leukemia. “What can you do? No good in crying, so I threw myself full on into my work and made being a doctor my life’s work. I was an oncologist.”\\n\\n“Studied cancer?”\\n\\n“Very good. Most people don’t know that. I did. Eventually, though, I couldn’t hide from the gaping hollow inside of me. The great emptiness became too much. I started smoking and buying scratch tickets and tearing the tags off mattresses. One time I even dumped a load of trash under one of those signs that tells you there’s a huge fine for doing so. I started small, but I realized that I loved doing bad things. Eventually, I lost my license to practice when they found out I was addicted and writing my own prescriptions.”\\n\\n“Man. That sucks.”\\n\\n“Sure did, but again, what was I gonna do? Cry? I don’t think so.”\\n\\n“What’d you do?”\\n\\n“I moved on to other things. Someone got me a gig giving eulogies and speaking at people’s funerals. Oddly enough, I was very good at it. People want to believe their deceased loved ones were the greatest thing that ever existed, even when they weren’t, so I just played it up. Said nice things.”\\n\\n“Wow. That’s interesting.”\\n\\n“It is, huh?”\\n\\n“Yeah. What happened with that?”\\n\\n“Well, you know, addiction is bad enough to stand between a man and anything and everything he could ever want for himself. Besides that, though, I had this bit where I’d take these white doves or pigeons and release them from a basket as I said something about the beloved deceased’s soul being free from the body of flesh like the birds from the basket. Now they could fly high, unhindered by life and its weight.”\\n\\n“Yeah?”\\n\\n“Well, one time, we were at this funeral on the side of the freeway. I released the birds. Two of them flew right into a semi going 80 miles per hour. It was a ghastly sight. No one was happy. I didn’t want to do it anymore.”\\n\\n“Shoot. Don’t blame ya.”\\n\\n“No? I was a deer strangler after that.”\\n\\n“What’s a deer strangler do?”\\n\\n“Strangle deer.”\\n\\n“Makes sense.”\\n\\n“It does, doesn’t it? Yeah. They’re overpopulated and a nuisance in certain parts of the north. A lot of neighborhoods have laws about discharging firearms or shooting live animals and that kind of thing. So, they pay someone to trap ‘em and strangle ‘em. It was good money.  A lot of free meat.  Left it too, though. Couldn’t handle it.” We talked until dawn. I gave him another balloon as the sun came up. \\n\\nThat was the first night we met. We were always together after that, always had each other’s back. He wasn’t there that night, though, under the theatre overhang next to the box office window with me. The sentimentality invoked by my memories faded. I drifted into a land of sleep and terror. \\n\\nI had visions of evil in the dark and everything was on fire. The Faceless One would be the end of us. Rufus would die. It was made clear by the nightmare beings that visited me and the awful things they spoke to me as I slept. When I woke up, my arm was totally asleep. I was whimpering. The cops would be by soon to kick us and make us leave. Water trucks would blast firehose jets at the walls and sidewalk to wash away the night’s feces and urine after that. \\n\\nI opened my eyes. A figure stood at my feet in a cloud of potent pot smoke like some fantastic apparition translated from some nether realm to that time and place before me. He spoke with a wobbly voice.\\n\\n“Boom Boom? What ya crying for? You know that don’t do no good.” It was Rufus.     \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       ## We were faithful practitioners of an antique religion. It originated in 19th century Asia, but a vein of revival made its way up from Mexico in the early nineteen nineties. Upon conversion, we sold all we had to follow our goddess. We lived for her, and in back alleys and hotel rooms all around the city, we built altars to her with blackened spoons, the bottom halves of aluminum cans, needles, empty cigarette boxes and the gnawed leather of looped belts.  These were the worn relics of our sacrament and liturgy. We practiced the ritual of cooking magical potions, conjuring up blissful sleep and vapor the smell of vinegar and brown sugar. We vomited and hiccupped as a rite of passage. Daily devoting ourselves, tying ourselves off, kneeling before her altar and letting blood from our arms. We were ready to sacrifice our first born if she asked.\\n\\n## Heroin was life for us, and without her we were dead. Every heartbeat. Every thought. Every move. Every drop of gasoline in the car. Every cent we made. Every calorie we consumed. Every breath was devoted to the chase for more.\\n\\nFour Hondurans started selling heroin and cocaine at five in the morning. They came like clockwork, because they got off the first bus that brought them to the park. Besides Chivo, it was the only other place we knew to get heroin in town, and it was the only place it was available at five a.m. Chivo started at eight, but sickness started early. They sold dimes, or ten dollars’ worth, in tightly wrapped balls made from cut squares of trash bag. Black was heroine. White was cocaine. They sold five for 40 dollars as an incentive to buyers and allowed any combination.\\n\\nWe woke up before five, sick as usual. I gathered together the random CDs in the car and went to see if one of the Hondurans in the park would trade a dime of black for them. Roger was the one we knew best, but he laughed at my offer. He seemed annoyed. He would not even look at me.\\n\\nWe were out of luck, so we parked next to a Seven Eleven. In the car, we stretched and yawned. Our bodies ached, and the anxiety set in. We never knew where we would get it. We just had to have it. Watery snot and tears started, the sure signs of dope sickness.\\n\\n“What are we going to do, bubby?” Danielle lay back in the passenger seat.\\n\\n“I don’t know, baby. I’m tired. We can call Chivo and ask for another front, or we can do something, but it’s too early to call Chivo. Let me chill for a minute. We’ll get it. Don’t worry. I don’t know how but we will.” She always said she liked me better when I was sick. Heroine made me extremely mean and difficult. When I was sick, I felt exposed and sensitive. Television commercials brought tears to my eyes, and I was nice to her.\\n\\n“OK, bubby. I’m sick as s\\*\\*\\*.” She held her stomach.\\n\\n“I know, baby. Me too.” I folded my arms and closed my eyes. My back and head ached. I pushed back into the driver’s seat. Not two minutes passed before we heard a knock on the window.\\n\\nA strange individual tried to talk to us through the closed window. Thick glasses, a shaved head, orange freckles on pale skin, a gaunt face. Maybe a man. Maybe a lesbian. I tried to tell the person to wait till we rolled the window down, but they continued to talk. As the window lowered, I could hear he was a man.\\n\\n“I need a ride out of here! Right now! I’ve got money! I’ll pay you. I have to get out of this state!” He seemed genuinely desperate for our help. Through the window he flashed several bills, mostly ones and a five. It was good enough for me.\\n\\n“Get in!”\\n\\nDanielle had to open her door to open the door for him to crawl into the back, and we took off.\\n\\n“Where do you want to go?” I didn’t know where he went. There was nothing in the back seat, but a pile of clothes.\\n\\n“I don’t know! Anywhere, out of here!” His voice came from the clothes. He had buried himself in the pile of unfolded and dirty clothes.\\n\\n“Well, maybe you could give us a little more direction. If you pay, we’ll take you anywhere you want.” I remembered the condition of my release from jail. My travels were not to exceed a 150-mile radius from there, but money was on the line. He never gave us a destination.\\n\\nTraffic halted for miles on the interstate. It was from people headed to work, so we were stuck for a while. He talked about the people chasing him. They wanted to kill him, and the cops would send him to prison. He had spent the previous night jumping fences to escape. A day or two before that, he threw away several ounces in a hotel room of the casino, because he thought he was being set up. Danielle and I knew what he needed.\\n\\n“Why don’t you let us get you some heroin? That’ll calm you down. We can get a hotel room and get some brown. Hey, what’s your name anyway? If we are going to be helping you escape and partners in crime, we should know each other’s names.”\\n\\n“I’m Carl.”\\n\\n“I’m Riley. This is Danielle.”\\n\\nHe agreed that getting heroin was a good idea, so we pulled off at the next exit, and called Chivo. We found a Motel 6, and she checked into the room, for us. He snuck in while we waited for Chivo. We never had much money to score, so Chivo’s driver hurried to meet us at the gas station down the street. Out of the four 50-dollar balloons, Carl gave us three to share, which he did several more times. He always gave us three and kept one. It was Christmas morning, and we were little kids.\\n\\nWhen Danielle and I got high, we bickered and said nasty things to one another, not as a matter of any real hurt or problems we had, but like an allergic reaction to the heroin. There were two or three days in a row of us sitting in a dark, cool Motel 6 room watching HBO high on heroin and Danielle and I squabbling. Carl spent time on his computer and whined about our fussing and fighting.\\n\\n“You guys should love one another. You never know when you won’t have the other one with you again.” He whimpered. His life was hard, one of six boys, the youngest, and regularly raped by one of his brothers. His father hated him. He found love with an old man named Tony, who taught him the trade of stealing fine art, paintings and such. They were busted together and sent to different prisons where Tony died of AIDS, I guessed. Danielle and I thought Carl turned tricks off the Internet for the money he had, but we had no proof. On our third day together, he had us drop him off in the middle of nowhere, because he did not want to hear us fight. His countenance was quiet and depressed, and he wouldn’t make eye contact.\\n\\nDanielle and I came back from trying to score all day at around 630 to find Carl outside of the room waiting for us. He got four balloons as usual, but this time he only gave us one and kept three. Then he gave us 20 bucks and sent us to Wendy’s to get some dinner.\\n\\nCarl lay on the floor sweaty and flaccid by the time we got back to the room. A few slaps to the face and yells of his name proved he had overdosed. Danielle shrieked and flapped her hands at her face in fear, while I ran to the bathroom and saturated a hand towel with water. When I rung it out over his face and the water hit him he came to.\\n\\n“Hey, mother f\\*\\*\\*er, we’re calling 911! You need to go to the hospital!” I didn’t take his attempt at suicide personally. It was his prerogative far as I saw it, but overdosing himself in the hotel room where we slept was unacceptable.\\n\\n“No! No! No! Don’t call the ambulance. I’m okay. I’m okay.” He begged us not to call. I listened to him, for some reason. Soon after all of it, I regretted not robbing him for all his money and sending him overdosed to the hospital. We would have been gone with his electronics and money before he got out of the hospital.\\n\\nWe feared that he would asphyxiate, so we made him sit up against the corner of the room on his bed while we watched TV. The blankets were around him, and she and I must have given cues that I was nodding out with our conversation. His eyes were closed, but he was awake.\\n\\n“See? Riley is nodding out. Why doesn’t he have to go to the hospital?”\\n\\n“Shut the f\\*\\*\\* up, Carl. Or we will call 911 to come get your overdosing a\\*\\*.” It was 1030.\\n\\n“It’s not fair. You are as high as I am.”\\n\\n“Shut the f\\*\\*\\* up, Carl!”\\n\\nHe was snoring at 130 when I went to sleep. The Hangover played mute on the TV. Danielle woke me up at 10.\\n\\n“Riley. Riley. Wake up. I think he’s dead.”\\n\\n“No, he’s not dead.” I opened my eyes and looked at him. I was not so sure.\\n\\n“I’m pretty sure he’s dead, bubby! He looks dead!”\\n\\n“No. He’s not dead. Let’s find a rinse before we check.”\\n\\nWe found the bottom half of a coke can on a shelf below the TV. It had a spot of brown goo on the edge with a gray, shriveled cotton in the middle. It was all that was left of the three balloons he did the day before. I wondered how he even managed to get that much tar into a syringe and inject it while we were at Wendy’s. I thought he must have skin-popped it. It would have been several injections of black sludge, and if he had hit a vein the first one would have put him out.\\n\\nWe washed the bottom of the coke can with water and even sucked it through his old cotton. It was not the clean thing to do, but we didn’t care. She peed on the toilet and kept telling me he was dead while I split the syringes of slightly colored water. I denied it one more time before I hit a vein in her arm and then my own.\\n\\nI walked out first and went over to his bed. I focused on his mouth and the strand of drool hanging from his chin. It was dried out and stuck there, the consistency of hair sprayed spider web. When I put my hand on his shoulder to shake him awake, I said, “Carl!” But he rolled over, cold and stiff. His legs never unfolded or changed position. The dried-out stalactite of drool stood upside down in the air, and his head hung off the bed. His eyes belonged on ice at the super market. They may as well have been a pair of yellow, lumpy grapes for all the life that they had in them.\\n\\n“He’s dead.” Danielle cried. I pulled him off the bed onto the floor. It only took a second for me to consider what money he might have on him and reached into the pocket of his shorts to find a black leather wallet. There were 250 dollars, so I took the two big bills and left the 50.\\n\\nDanielle called 911 like we should have the night before. She said the operator said to give him mouth to mouth. One look at his dead mouth and the thought of the stale air trapped in his lungs settled it in my mind that I was not giving him mouth to mouth.\\n\\n“I’m not giving him mouth to mouth!”\\n\\n“Come on, Riley! Just try! Is he cold?”\\n\\n“Not cold, but he’s not warm. If you want to give him mouth to mouth get over here and do it. Or they can come do it, but I AM NOT doing it!”\\n\\nShe talked into the phone. “He’s not completely cold. Is that a good thing? Is there a chance he might live?” She asked in tears and then turned to me. “She says to put your mouth on his mouth and breath.”\\n\\n“Hang up!”\\n\\nWe gathered the syringes and cookers and balloons and threw the in the dumpster at the back of the parking lot. We stepped outside as the fire truck pulled up. They quickly gave up on trying to resuscitate Carl’s dead body. One squad car pulled up, then another, and one more. A cop put up the yellow tape around the room, and they separated Danielle and me, to question us. She spoke so I could hear her, to get our stories to match up. The black cop dressed in blues flirted with her. She flirted back and told him she was a stripper. As I wrote a statement on the hot hood of a running squad car in the sun, I wondered how many years I could get for it. Would these be my last minutes of freedom scribbling and nervous on the hood of a cop car?\\n\\nAn unmarked car pulled up with two detectives. They wore jackets, slacks and ties and had personality. They slicked their black hair back true to their Hispanic heritage. One of them talked to me about the Hornets and mentioned the Nuggets. Sickly scents of pomade and cologne mixed with fear to turn my stomach. His partner walked around and talked to the policemen before he walked up to me.\\n\\n“Look. We got an overdose to go to right after this, two blocks away. Another dead body. We don’t have time for all of this. Where are the syringes and cookers? You don’t think he overdosed on air, do you? No. We don’t either. Now, we understand, you and your girlfriend got scared and hid all the stuff. But we need some evidence of his drug use. We need some syringes for evidence, and we’ll get you two on your way. I promise.”\\n\\nThey took me to the dumpster where we tossed the stuff, and made me climb in, but I couldn’t find it. There were several empty 20 oz. bottles from another room with syringes in them. We never put our syringes in bottles like that, but the detective seemed satisfied.\\n\\n“OK. Grab a few and give them to me.”\\n\\nThey took some pictures and got our written statements. Things wrapped up, and the coroner came. A hearse came to pick up the body. It was obvious that one of the two men working for the company with the hearse enjoyed his job, maybe too much. He had a black three-piece suit and a felt top hat on, with a gold chain to a watch in his breast pocket. He wore a monocle. I didn’t know hearses picked up overdosed bodies out of hotel rooms, but that’s what I saw that day.\\n\\nWhen they finally took the yellow police tape down and released us from the scene, she jumped into my arms and wrapped her legs around my waist. We shouted in glee and relief and made out in front of the last two cops on the scene. It was over, and we were free. I still had the 200 hundred dollars.\\n\\nThe first thing we did was call Chivo and met one of his guys at a gas station. When his driver showed up, I told him what happened. It didn’t really matter to him. They wanted the money. At some point in the day, I spilled the last of our heroin out of a cooker onto my khaki pants. She was mad, so we went to Home Depot. I tried to steal a bunch of copper wire, but on the way out of the door, loss prevention drove me to the ground so hard the scab on my knee had fabric from my pants in it and turned it green. Lock up smelled better than the last one, and they let me out after three days for petit theft.\\n\\nA week later, the coroner called to ask what I knew about Carl. I told him what Carl told me, maybe it was true, maybe not, but it’s what he said. His tone of voice seemed bewildered over the phone. Sometime after that, on our way to Danielle’s first night stripping again, a strange figure riding a scooter pulled up next to us. Danielle and I looked over at a 55-year-old lesbian in a black leather cap and vest, thick glasses, orang freckles and pale face. Her hair was red and grey and buzzed off. Could it be Carl? It looked exactly like him. We laughed about when the 911 operator had instructed us to give him mouth to mouth.\\n\\nI never felt much about robbing the dead man, or the fact that the last words he heard before he died were me telling him to, “shut the f\\*\\*\\* up.” There was no time to feel bad about it, when spilled hits of heroin and three days in jail were so disappointing. The only thing I ever thought about it was that I should have robbed him when he was overdosed and called the paramedics. It would have been less trouble for us.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Now maybe you’re thinking and asking yourself, “What is this guy doing ripping people’s eyeballs out of their heads for? He’s a monster. I hate him, and I’m not going to read the rest of this crap either.” \\n\\nThe payment for the eyeball was a half-ounce of the best heroin in town. I couldn’t turn that down. He was going to get his eyeball removed from him one way or another. It didn’t matter. If I didn’t do it, someone else would. Besides, there were promises made during the negotiations of the deal that Bug was in fact a very bad guy who had done some very bad things, to kids even. His boyish kimono wearing lover on the bed lent credibility to that idea.   \\n\\nAs to accusations of me being a monster? I am. There’s no doubt. I would never deny that. They call me Boom Boom, and that’s not for nothing. And you’d be totally justified if you quit reading right now. I think the thing to do when writing is show yourself to be human and create some sort of empathy between yourself and the reader before dropping bombs of over-the-top and borderline unrealistic scenes of mindless violence on them. I think if you keep reading, though, you will appreciate the things I have to say and the story I have to tell. \\n\\nSo anyway, I had moved the eyeball from my pocket into an empty box of chocolate milk I found on a stoop up from Jimbo’s shop. It was a better container for the eye. Otherwise, it might have gotten crushed in my pocket and squeezed out whatever squeezes out of eyeballs when they get crushed in people’s pockets. I imagined clear jelly. I carried the carton in my hand as I walked and shook it from time to time, partly to make sure it was still in there and partly because I was fascinated by the sounds it made. \\n\\nThe sign above the shop said THE LAND OF ENCHANTMENT. That’s the nickname for the state of New Mexico, where Jimbo was supposedly from. I walked in. As usual, a white sage smudge stick smoldered on the counter by the register where Jimbo leaned on his elbows. The smoke always burned my eyes. Jimbo was always watching a box TV and trying to fix the antenna.\\n\\nHe jumped up and walked to meet me in the middle of the shop.\\n\\n“You got it?”\\n\\n“Yeah. Right here.” \\n\\nOff in the corner his lover, Finnish Fin, sat on a beanbag chair red eyed and smoking a joint. He was fat and feminine but very nice. He smiled and held his hand out to say hello to me. At his feet lay two obese dalmatians. Their names were Sasha and Sabrina. They could barely walk. \\n\\n“Good! Good!” Jimbo said rubbing his hands. At that moment, my attention turned to the goiter on the side of his neck. It was always hard not to look at it, and as he opened the top of the carton to see into it, he asked me, “Are you looking at my goiter again?”\\n\\n“Sure am, Jimbo.”\\n\\n“Well, does it look any different?”\\n\\n“Nah. Maybe like it’s hardening in some spots. Calcifying or whatever the hell it is goiters do.”\\n\\n“Too bad.” He said. He was completely engrossed with the task at hand.   \\n\\nJimbo walked back behind the counter and pulled a plate out. He dumped the contents of the carton out, and apparently, there had been more chocolate milk in it than I’d thought. The eyeball floated plopped out in the middle of the shallow puddle. A translucent floatie moved around in the brown liquid next to it. The whole scene reminded me of every time I’d ever cracked an egg to scramble. \\n\\n“Boss man will be happy about this one! Fin, give it to him.”\\n\\nThe blond, pale skinned man on the bean bag chair reached into his coat pocket and produced several packages wrapped in butcher paper. He fumbled through them and threw one up in the air to me. I peeled the tape off and unrolled it. There was another layer of tinfoil but under that was a clear sandwich baggie holding the brown powder about thick around as a cigar. I held the package to my nose and inhaled. It smelled sort of like vinegar, but the best way to say what it smelled like is that it smelled like heroin. You know like when people eat something and say it tastes like chicken, but chicken is what really tastes like chicken. The weight in my hand smelled like heroin, good heroin. I was excited and said,\\n\\n“I’m out of works!”\\n\\n“Here, Boom Boom.” Fin stood up and pulled open a drawer. He produced a syringe and a cooker that even had the twist ties from the needle exchange and one of those blue water droppers. “Use the closet back here. The windows, you know?” He gestured towards the shop’s large windows. “Oh ya, Boom Boom, be careful. That’s good stuff.”\\n\\nI walked to the closet and found a bucket. I turned it over, rolled up my sleeve and sat down to fix it up. *You missed it, Rufus*. I thought. *Hopefully, I still have some when you get out.* \n",

stuff.\\n\\n## \\n\\n## \\n\\n## Danielle PART 1 \\n\\n## \\n\\n## \\n\\n## The scars on my neck belong to her. Two cigarette burns, perfectly round and white, sit two inches below my ears where Frankenstein’s creature had his bolts. I see them every time I shave, and they remind me of hard days with my girl. Her name was Danielle, but I just called her baby.\\n\\n## In the middle of our arguments we screamed in one another’s faces. Sometimes, I cleared my throat and hawked phlegm into her eyes, and she spat back into mine. We tried to blow each other away with the spray of verbal buckshot until there was nothing left of us. Ten minutes later we made love on the bed or the back seat of the Camry and found something or someone to rob. It was a game we played, and it was killing both of us.\\n\\nThe first time I met her, her boyfriend lay on the floor of my apartment trembling and bleeding through his pants. My drug dealers pulled him out of her Camry on the south side of town and stabbed him in the knee for trying to go around me and deal with them directly. It didn’t work out for him, thus the crying and bleeding on my floor.\\n\\n“Hi.”\\n\\n“Hi.”\\n\\n“Are you Riley?”\\n\\n“Yes. You must be Danielle.”\\n\\n“Sure am.” She dropped his head to put her hand out.\\n\\n“Good to finally meet you.” I smiled and pinched her fingers.\\n\\nI was seeing a different girl at the time, a 19-year-old red head who liked to smoke her dope and tell me she was on her way over hours before she left her house, but that morning in my apartment, the look in Danielle’s eye told me it was only a matter of time before we got together. Never mind Mike and the red head.\\n\\nDanielle and Mike used to come over every day before three to laugh at me for nodding out and looking like Teen Wolf. She always tried to get alone with me, but we didn’t hook up until after Mike started beating her again and I spent two weeks locked up, promising myself and everyone else that I would never do heroin again.\\n\\nMike took the battery out of her car and held her against her will in a trailer on the Mesa while I sat in jail. Then he passed out one afternoon after he put the battery back in, and she made her escape. Half an hour later, I called her from the payphone outside of the jail, and our reign of terror began.\\n\\nI should tell you that this is the part of the story where you might want to stop reading. On the next page or so, I’m going to sell a guy a bag of dirt for 40 dollars and turn his face into hamburger meat before I hold him hostage in his bedroom for the night. My girlfriend will beg me to infect her with the Hepatitis C virus, and I will try. A few pages after that, I will rob a dead man, so if you’re not with all that or don’t understand that we were in a bad way, this is a good time to stop reading.\\n\\nOne of the only three heroin dealers in town fronted us packages of dope, and we came back with the money every night. He fronted us more, and we returned with more cash. Then he gave us a half-ounce, but we never came back. He offered anyone in town a 50-dollar bag for our whereabouts and left promises to murder me on her voicemail. We ripped off other junkies. They hated us. We stole merchandise and food from businesses. The owners and employees hated us. Several cops in town knew that I was driving the Camry and that I had a girlfriend. They hated us too, but we hated each other most of all.\\n\\nDanielle had a monthly prescription for 90 Colonopin and a SSI check. Both were available on the first of the month, and we shot so much dope and took so many pills the first week of the month that our only friend quit hanging out with us. When her orange pill bottle quit rattling and the check was spent, anxiety wrought havoc. More than once she left me at the gas station and freezing at three in the morning while I was buying cigarettes and drove by a few times, screaming and giving me the finger for no reason. Later in the night we would go to the ER looking for meds.\\n\\nHer Camry became our home. We cleaned out the ashtray at the casino several times a day and listened to Depeche Mode and Seminole Wind by John Anderson. Our diet consisted entirely of Wendy’s spicy chicken nuggets and Baja Blast. She made me give her a shot of dope visibly mixed with my own blood to intentionally contract Hepatitis C. That way I could no longer use contamination as an excuse for why I wouldn’t share a hit or a rinse with her. One afternoon I pulled over on the side of the highway and proposed to her with her own wooden ring. She said yes and we made out like two outlaws in love.\\n\\nA lot of guys liked her. One of them lived in a nice apartment his parents paid for. His name was Justin. Now I forget what he said, but it made me mad. Then he gave us 40 bucks to go score, so she and I split it between us and put dirt in his bag. He called to complain, but we quit answering the phone. Later that night, I decided we should sleep at his place, so I parked in his parking lot and told her,\\n\\n“Get all of our blankets and meet me at the front door, baby.”\\n\\nAs I walked through the cobblestone courtyard of the adobe apartment complex, I wondered how mad he was and thought of what I was about to do. I fingered the baggie in my pocket. At his front door breath billowed out of my mouth, and the raps of my knuckles on his door bit cold into my bones. I put my hand back into my pocket and waited. The television played on the other side of the door. He opened it, but the chain only allowed a few inches.\\n\\n“Who is that? Riley? What do you want? I ought to mess you up for selling me dirt! Get out of here!” The interior light of his apartment poured out yellow through the crack in the door. It looked warm and comfortable.\\n\\n“I know. I know. Listen. I got something here, to make up for it.” I moved my arm and hand in my pocket, to indicate it was in my pocket. “Open up, so I can show you.”\\n\\n“Ok.” The door closed momentarily while the chain latch came off. The knob turned. I grabbed it and lodged myself in the doorframe so he couldn’t close it. “What are you doing? You can’t stay here! Why does she have blankets? Dude, what the f\\*\\*\\*? Seriously?” A pile of blankets with Danielle’s legs bounced through the courtyard towards us. I made sure she got in before I let him shut the door.\\n\\nShe threw the blankets on the shag rug in front of his TV. He whined in the kitchen and flapped his arms, but we disregarded him until we had settled in and felt ready to address him. His accusations were mostly accurate, except when he said we didn’t have any heroin. We did, but not for him.\\n\\nAfter she and I situated things, I showed him the 20-dollar bag we had. It was enough to shut him up, because we promised to share. We told him we would split it three ways, but in the bathroom, she and I split it down the middle. Afterwards, we rinsed the spoon and cotton filter a few more times, until all that was left was dirt and ash in the spoon. Then we sucked it up and came out of the bathroom to give it to him. He happily took the syringe full of dirty water and never accused us of anything until we hid ourselves in the bathroom again.\\n\\nDanielle had her pants down, and I sat on the toilet applying cortisone cream to a patch of eczema on her rear end and thigh. She leaned over the sink. The door was locked while I took care of my baby.\\n\\n“Open up. I know you’re in there doing more! Open up! You pieces of s\\*\\*\\*!” The door shook as he pounded. “Open up! Open the f\\*\\*\\*ing door!” The door hit her in the head when he kicked it in.\\n\\nMy hands ripped the cedar towel rack out of the wall, before I could think. I beat him back out of the bathroom and side-to-side, across the living room with the wooden rod. A symphony of rage blared out of me and into my opponent. I was the impassioned composer of a brutal work, wildly conducting an orchestra of fingers, fists and arms. He tripped and fell backwards over his coffee table and couch.\\n\\nMy shirt was off and sweat was dripping when I threw the rod at his face. He could have it, because I owned him now. I leapt onto his chest for the crescendo of my opus and went to work. I pinned his arms under my legs. Bare knuckles bloodied themselves on his cheeks, and his face turned side to side with each punch. Snot and blood leaked from his mouth and nose, and he squealed as I stopped to catch my breath.\\n\\n“Please, stop! Please! Please!” My teeth bit into my bottom lip. I looked at him for a second with my fist cocked back, before I tried to drive it through the back of his skull. His face was swollen and discolored and bloody.\\n\\n“That’s what you get for messing with my girl.” I thought and jumped up to grab the biggest butcher knife in the kitchen. About 10 inches of blade shined in the living room light.\\n\\n“I will f***ing kill you! You piece of s***! I will f***ing gut you! You f***ing hear me?” The F word constituted about one of every ten of my words back then! “Get in your room and give me your cell phone! You can come out in the morning, when she and I are done. You hear me, you f***ing piece of s***? Come out of the room, and I will stick this f***ing knife in your throat! Your guts will be all over this f***ing floor! You f\\*\\*\\*ing hear me?”\\n\\nHe didn’t say anything. He gave me his phone and held his face as he walked into his room. People around town always told me that he was a fighter. Supposedly he stood up to Diablo once and even “gave him a run for his money.” Everyone always said he was tough, but not that night.\\n\\nDanielle and I made a bed on the floor out of our blankets. She pulled up some pornography on his phone. Whatever meth we did the day before was too strong and the heroin was too weak to get us to sleep, so we had sex on and off throughout the night. Sometimes, I smoked cigarettes and tried to write poetry on pieces of cardboard box. She played dress up with some clothes that she had brought in. Later in the night she said something that hurt my feelings, so I used the scissors in my hand to stab myself in the leg a few times, but as daylight broke there was forgiveness and more sex. We defiled his toothbrush before we left, but I can’t remember why.\n",

read these?  These are true life.   \\n\\n## Danielle PART 1 The scars on my neck belong to her. Two cigarette burns, perfectly round and white, sit two inches below my ears where Frankenstein’s creature had his bolts. I see them every time I shave, and they remind me of hard days with my girl. Her name was Danielle, but I just called her baby.\\n\\n## In the middle of our arguments we screamed in one another’s faces. Sometimes, I cleared my throat and hawked phlegm into her eyes, and she spat back into mine. We tried to blow each other away with the spray of verbal buckshot until there was nothing left of us. Ten minutes later we made love on the bed or the back seat of the Camry and found something or someone to rob. It was a game we played, and it was killing both of us.\\n\\nThe first time I met her, her boyfriend lay on the floor of my apartment trembling and bleeding through his pants. My drug dealers pulled him out of her Camry on the south side of town and stabbed him in the knee for trying to go around me and deal with them directly. It didn’t work out for him, thus the crying and bleeding on my floor.\\n\\n“Hi.”\\n\\n“Hi.”\\n\\n“Are you Riley?”\\n\\n“Yes. You must be Danielle.”\\n\\n“Sure am.” She dropped his head to put her hand out.\\n\\n“Good to finally meet you.” I smiled and pinched her fingers.\\n\\nI was seeing a different girl at the time, a 19-year-old red head who liked to smoke her dope and tell me she was on her way over hours before she left her house, but that morning in my apartment, the look in Danielle’s eye told me it was only a matter of time before we got together. Never mind Mike and the red head.\\n\\nDanielle and Mike used to come over every day before three to laugh at me for nodding out and looking like Teen Wolf. She always tried to get alone with me, but we didn’t hook up until after Mike started beating her again and I spent two weeks locked up, promising myself and everyone else that I would never do heroin again.\\n\\nMike took the battery out of her car and held her against her will in a trailer on the Mesa while I sat in jail. Then he passed out one afternoon after he put the battery back in, and she made her escape. Half an hour later, I called her from the payphone outside of the jail, and our reign of terror began.\\n\\nI should tell you that this is the part of the story where you might want to stop reading. On the next page or so, I’m going to sell a guy a bag of dirt for 40 dollars and turn his face into hamburger meat before I hold him hostage in his bedroom for the night. My girlfriend will beg me to infect her with the Hepatitis C virus, and I will try. A few pages after that, I will rob a dead man, so if you’re not with all that or don’t understand that we were in a bad way, this is a good time to stop reading.\\n\\nOne of the only three heroin dealers in town fronted us packages of dope, and we came back with the money every night. He fronted us more, and we returned with more cash. Then he gave us a half-ounce, but we never came back. He offered anyone in town a 50-dollar bag for our whereabouts and left promises to murder me on her voicemail. We ripped off other junkies. They hated us. We stole merchandise and food from businesses. The owners and employees hated us. Several cops in town knew that I was driving the Camry and that I had a girlfriend. They hated us too, but we hated each other most of all.\\n\\nDanielle had a monthly prescription for 90 Colonopin and a SSI check. Both were available on the first of the month, and we shot so much dope and took so many pills the first week of the month that our only friend quit hanging out with us. When her orange pill bottle quit rattling and the check was spent, anxiety wrought havoc. More than once she left me at the gas station and freezing at three in the morning while I was buying cigarettes and drove by a few times, screaming and giving me the finger for no reason. Later in the night we would go to the ER looking for meds.\\n\\nHer Camry became our home. We cleaned out the ashtray at the casino several times a day and listened to Depeche Mode and Seminole Wind by John Anderson. Our diet consisted entirely of Wendy’s spicy chicken nuggets and Baja Blast. She made me give her a shot of dope visibly mixed with my own blood to intentionally contract Hepatitis C. That way I could no longer use contamination as an excuse for why I wouldn’t share a hit or a rinse with her. One afternoon I pulled over on the side of the highway and proposed to her with her own wooden ring. She said yes and we made out like two outlaws in love.\\n\\nA lot of guys liked her. One of them lived in a nice apartment his parents paid for. His name was Justin. Now I forget what he said, but it made me mad. Then he gave us 40 bucks to go score, so she and I split it between us and put dirt in his bag. He called to complain, but we quit answering the phone. Later that night, I decided we should sleep at his place, so I parked in his parking lot and told her,\\n\\n“Get all of our blankets and meet me at the front door, baby.”\\n\\nAs I walked through the cobblestone courtyard of the adobe apartment complex, I wondered how mad he was and thought of what I was about to do. I fingered the baggie in my pocket. At his front door breath billowed out of my mouth, and the raps of my knuckles on his door bit cold into my bones. I put my hand back into my pocket and waited. The television played on the other side of the door. He opened it, but the chain only allowed a few inches.\\n\\n“Who is that? Riley? What do you want? I ought to mess you up for selling me dirt! Get out of here!” The interior light of his apartment poured out yellow through the crack in the door. It looked warm and comfortable.\\n\\n“I know. I know. Listen. I got something here, to make up for it.” I moved my arm and hand in my pocket, to indicate it was in my pocket. “Open up, so I can show you.”\\n\\n“Ok.” The door closed momentarily while the chain latch came off. The knob turned. I grabbed it and lodged myself in the doorframe so he couldn’t close it. “What are you doing? You can’t stay here! Why does she have blankets? Dude, what the f\\*\\*\\*? Seriously?” A pile of blankets with Danielle’s legs bounced through the courtyard towards us. I made sure she got in before I let him shut the door.\\n\\nShe threw the blankets on the shag rug in front of his TV. He whined in the kitchen and flapped his arms, but we disregarded him until we had settled in and felt ready to address him. His accusations were mostly accurate, except when he said we didn’t have any heroin. We did, but not for him.\\n\\nAfter she and I situated things, I showed him the 20-dollar bag we had. It was enough to shut him up, because we promised to share. We told him we would split it three ways, but in the bathroom, she and I split it down the middle. Afterwards, we rinsed the spoon and cotton filter a few more times, until all that was left was dirt and ash in the spoon. Then we sucked it up and came out of the bathroom to give it to him. He happily took the syringe full of dirty water and never accused us of anything until we hid ourselves in the bathroom again.\\n\\nDanielle had her pants down, and I sat on the toilet applying cortisone cream to a patch of eczema on her rear end and thigh. She leaned over the sink. The door was locked while I took care of my baby.\\n\\n“Open up. I know you’re in there doing more! Open up! You pieces of s\\*\\*\\*!” The door shook as he pounded. “Open up! Open the f\\*\\*\\*ing door!” The door hit her in the head when he kicked it in.\\n\\nMy hands ripped the cedar towel rack out of the wall, before I could think. I beat him back out of the bathroom and side-to-side, across the living room with the wooden rod. A symphony of rage blared out of me and into my opponent. I was the impassioned composer of a brutal work, wildly conducting an orchestra of fingers, fists and arms. He tripped and fell backwards over his coffee table and couch.\\n\\nMy shirt was off and sweat was dripping when I threw the rod at his face. He could have it, because I owned him now. I leapt onto his chest for the crescendo of my opus and went to work. I pinned his arms under my legs. Bare knuckles bloodied themselves on his cheeks, and his face turned side to side with each punch. Snot and blood leaked from his mouth and nose, and he squealed as I stopped to catch my breath.\\n\\n“Please, stop! Please! Please!” My teeth bit into my bottom lip. I looked at him for a second with my fist cocked back, before I tried to drive it through the back of his skull. His face was swollen and discolored and bloody.\\n\\n“That’s what you get for messing with my girl.” I thought and jumped up to grab the biggest butcher knife in the kitchen. About 10 inches of blade shined in the living room light.\\n\\n“I will f***ing kill you! You piece of s***! I will f***ing gut you! You f***ing hear me?” The F word constituted about one of every ten of my words back then! “Get in your room and give me your cell phone! You can come out in the morning, when she and I are done. You hear me, you f***ing piece of s***? Come out of the room, and I will stick this f***ing knife in your throat! Your guts will be all over this f***ing floor! You f\\*\\*\\*ing hear me?”\\n\\nHe didn’t say anything. He gave me his phone and held his face as he walked into his room. People around town always told me that he was a fighter. Supposedly he stood up to Diablo once and even “gave him a run for his money.” Everyone always said he was tough, but not that night.\\n\\nDanielle and I made a bed on the floor out of our blankets. She pulled up some pornography on his phone. Whatever meth we did the day before was too strong and the heroin was too weak to get us to sleep, so we had sex on and off throughout the night. Sometimes, I smoked cigarettes and tried to write poetry on pieces of cardboard box. She played dress up with some clothes that she had brought in. Later in the night she said something that hurt my feelings, so I used the scissors in my hand to stab myself in the leg a few times, but as daylight broke there was forgiveness and more sex. We defiled his toothbrush before we left, but I can’t remember why.\n",

horrifying journey that is reading this book, it may cause you to question whether bringing a child into this world is the right thing to do anymore. It may not be. I don’t know. As your eyes travel the lines of ink, you may ask yourself why you’re even reading such trash. That’s on you. I can’t say. As your mind moves from thought to thought, you may wonder, “How does a person come up with such inane dialogue or depraved violence or this ridiculous storyline?” This one, I can answer. \\n\\nBoogers.\\n\\nBoogers are the unthinking result of any human being when certain extrabodily substances are breathed in. The body has no need for these things, namely dirt, particle debris or dust and the sloughed, dead skin cells of other human beings. So, the nose excretes mucus to catch the unwanted waste floating in the air, dries out and creates a nice little morsel to be easily extracted with a finger and flicked or wiped under your desk.\\n\\nMy writing process is the same. Unwanted information comes at me all day in the form of conversations between strangers at the store, jokes my friend told me fourteen years ago, old footage of hydrogen bombs exploding in desert, the obnoxious and steroid fueled ramblings of Macho Man Randy Savage and the like. My mind traps these bits of useless stimuli by excreting my imagination and personality like a mucus into my brain that dries out to create another kind of easily extracted morsel, but instead of wiping them on seats or the back of someone else’s shirt, I write. Words, as I know them, can be salty or bloody or crunchy or slimy or any combination of those things just like boogers. \\n\\nEvery sentence is a booger.\\n\\nThere were three other books I wanted to write: one about an angry old man who rides public transportation all day giving out extremely bad and unsolicited advice to strangers, another one about a rag tag group of immigrant sheepherders, and one about a homeless piece of Kleenex who struggles through life until he finally gets a break and starts a family of his own outside of Kansas City. The one about the Kleenex was a feel-good piece, one for the whole family to enjoy, but it was too short as were the other ones. So, I waited. I let my mind do what it does, the way my nose does what it does.\\n\\nAfter a while, I put my finger in there, dug around and pulled this thing out. It’s called The Terrible Hop Brothers. I hope you can forgive me, because it is. Absolutely. Terrible.\\n\\nYour Friend,\\n\\nRiley \\n\\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe Terrible Hop Brothers.  \\n\\nThe Ballad of Rufus Cumberbutt\\n\\nThe popularly circulated fiction that is our siblinghood begins with a transsexual prostitute from Bolivia who went by the name Naranja, claiming to be sweeter than any orange any man could buy at any super market in town. She may have been. I never found out just how sweet she was, but when I hear people refer to Rufus as my brother, I think of her. \\n\\nShe was the one who said it first. Rufus adopted it and introduced me to everyone as his brother after that, and he knew pretty much everyone. It was on a summer morning, and we were way up the hill in the middle of the city in the blinding white, light of the sun. The city never gets like that. Sometimes, the sun comes out and you have to take your jacket off, but this was like high noon in the Sahara, which is so abnormal its making this whole memory seem like a dream to me. And I don’t even know what we were doing up there, the way you just kind of end up in situations with your friends or family or other random people doing and saying crazy things in dreams.\\n\\nSo, there we were. I don’t remember why, but I do remember Rufus was in the middle of telling me he was going to need to fix soon. \\n\\n“I’m gonna need to fix soon.”\\n\\n“Yeah?  It's too hot.”\\n\\n“Yeah. Boom Boom, I’m not feeling good.” He had a habit of prematurely telling people that he was sick. He would even say it between nods, but this time he wasn’t exaggerating too badly. Our habits were about the same. We’d split our last heroin together, and I was starting to feel normal again myself.\\n\\n“Okay. Well, lets go see Carlos or Juju or Leroy. I got a few bucks.”\\n\\n“Let’s go.” On the way down the hill, our hips swaying side to side and our shoes slapping the sidewalk as we absorbed the shock, he began to talk. It never failed to blow me away how ridiculous his statements could be. “Yeah, Boom Boom, I’m thinking about becoming an artist.”\\n\\n“An artist? What do you know about art?”\\n\\n“Nothing really, but that don’t matter.”\\n\\n“How do you figure that?”\\n\\n“Well, half of art is just who the artist is and other crap like that. It doesn’t have to be that great.”\\n\\nHe did have a point. “That’s kinda true, but still.”\\n\\n“But still, what?”\\n\\n“I don’t know. What kind of stuff are you gonna paint?”\\n\\nRufus produced a bottle of ginger-ale out of nowhere, like a magician. Now, he offered it to me. I wasn’t a germaphobe, but Rufus was extra-unhygienic. He wore a raggedy, red beard, which always held the coagulated globules of some rancid grease or clots of half-chewed food in half-hardened chunks like dead baby birdies decaying in a nest or something. It smelled bad. Even worse, though, were his bleeding gums and the breath that came with his rotten mouth. Something unspoken inside of me would never let me drink after him. I realize now it was fear of catching his bad breath. Maybe that was irrational, but I just wouldn’t do it. \\n\\nHe held the drink out a moment longer before I put my palm up and shook my head. It disappeared after that. \\n\\n“Well, Boom Boom, I have thought long and hard about this.”\\n\\n“Really?”\\n\\n“Yes. I have. As you know, my name is Rufus Cumberbutt.”\\n\\nI nodded.\\n\\n“And if you wanted to get technical, that would be Dr. Rufus Cumberbutt, the third.”\\n\\nI opened my eyes and smiled. I’d never heard the bit about him being a third. One would have been enough. \\n\\n“So, the pieces will be called Cumberbutts. See? That already puts them in class with, I don’t know, let’s say a Monet? A Warhol? A Dali? A Cumberbutt.”\\n\\n“Haha. I don’t know about all that.”\\n\\n“I do. On top of the name, my hardened street persona and the intrigue of my character will bolster value in a major way. I’m telling ya! Hop head extraordinaire and street criminal Rufus Cumberbutt, a man who rejected a successful career as a doctor to live on the streets. How much more interesting could an artist be? Huh? I mean, I could even fake my own death.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Yeah. We’ll make it really violent and mysterious.”\\n\\n“We? Whatever. But what are they going to look like. You never said.”\\n\\n“You’ll be pleased to hear that I’ve also given a lot of attention to this aspect of being an artist, as well.”\\n\\n“You mean the art?”\\n\\n“Yes, my dear Boom Boom, the art. The art will be as mysterious and dark and genius as the artist himself. I will paint with black and red only on white canvas. The art will be simple. It will just say dark and cryptic things in like an old typewriter font. I might have to get someone else to help me with all that.”\\n\\n“Yeah. Maybe they can just do it for you. What will the quotes be?”\\n\\n“I’m not sure.”\\n\\n“But you’ve given this so much thought.”\\n\\n“I have. It’s still in the works. I will sign them R. Cumberbutt, though. Or just Rufus. And there’ll only be 4 or 5 ever made.”\\n\\n“4 or 5 prints of each piece?”\\n\\n“No, sir. 4 or 5 pieces total.”\\n\\n“Huh?”\\n\\n“Well, the shorter my career, the more mysterious, the more mysterious, the more valuable. Less pieces make them harder to find. When they’re harder to find, the more they cost. You understand?”\\n\\nHe didn’t get an answer from me. Besides, the fact that everything he’d just said was ridiculous and that he wasn’t even joking, we were outside of the New Honk Kong Hotel a few blocks from downtown. I had business there. We were an inseparable duo, except for all the times we got separated. Like that day. That day we got separated, even though we never meant to. \\n\\n“Roof, I’m a run up here real quick. I gotta see Bug.” Bug was one of two black, identical twins from Michigan. Bug and Boo. Apparently, they’d gone by those names since they grew up in the 60s there. \\n\\n“K. I’ll be here.”\\n\\nAs I entered the bottom of the dark stairway into the hotel, I whispered the word eyeball to myself three times. Eyeball. Eyeball. Eyeball. Then again at the top of the stairs while I was waiting for the hotel manager to buzz the gate. Eyeball. Eyeball. Eyeball. And after I signed in with my fake ID card at the front desk, I whispered again. Eyeball. Eyeball. Eyeball. One more time as I knocked on the door at room 408. Eyeball. Eyeball. Eyeball.\\n\\nThe fading heroin high sat in my throat like a warm sticky egg. I also imagined that the feeling it left in my stomach was a molten heavy metal like lead or mercury. Bug’s muffled voice came through the door.\\n\\n“Who’s that?”\\n\\n“It’s me. Boom Boom.”\\n\\n“What you want?”\\n\\n“I got some money. I was wondering if you could help me out.” \\n\\nAs soon as the chain lock came off the door, I pushed it open. He knew something was up and moved towards the window, where he turned sideways and bowed like a scared child. A young boy, maybe 19, maybe 18, I don’t know, lay on the bed wearing nothing but a kimono. His bangs stuck to his sweaty face. The room smelled like silicone and salty sweat. The boy was making weird spaceship sounds and gesturing wildly in the air. It was clear whatever amount of meth he’d just shot was too much for him. Bug was naked and shaking.\\n\\n“What you want?”\\n\\n“I come for Jimbo. He sent me per the Faceless One’s request. You know why I’m here?”\\n\\nHe didn’t respond. That was a yes as much as anything. I didn’t really know what I was doing there, though. I just knew we were all bad people doing bad things and when we got what we got around these parts, it was because we lived the lives we lived. No surprises. No tears. Just street life. \\n\\nI tried to get Bug to calm down. \\n\\n“I like this Buddha statue you got here. Do you ever rub it for good luck?” Certain parts of his brain had never developed from childhood. They had atrophied. It was most notable in his speech patterns. He talked like a kid.\\n\\n“No. Never.”\\n\\nI put my hand on the large brass statue. Bug jerked and reached toward his headboard and produced a knife. I broke his foot with the Buddha. As he fell to the floor, I stepped on his chest and bent down making a U shape with my thumb and pointer finger. They slowly pushed in around the eyeball and this strange series of thoughts and emotions ran through me.  I remembered being a kid with my sister, when our mom took us down to Mississippi to see her father late one spring. We stayed several weeks and into summer, and in the yard at our grandfather’s house, we had these weird mud things sticking out of the ground. He told us they were mudbug huts, like crayfish. We even took our little arms and pushed them down into the muddy holes searching for the little creatures. \\n\\nWrist deep and sweating in that room with the slime of his eye socket on my skin, it reminded me of that, but unlike the crustaceans in my grandfather's yard when I was a boy, his eye was easy to find. It snapped in a dull thud, muffled by his brain and head. I had it.\\n\\nHe cried on the floor. There wasn’t much blood. He would never say anything about it because if he did, he knew it would be more of the same or much worse. The boy in the kimono kept swooshing and swishing and now he was chewing a blue ink pen that had broken in his mouth and ran all down the side of his chin and face. I got my fake ID from the front desk and walked outside. \\n\\nThe sun blinded me again. Rufus told me to hold on. He ran down the block to see someone, but it looked like he ran to tell the cops to arrest him. They just happened to see him at the corner. They knew his mug and ran his name which came back with warrants. \\n\\nHe was always going to jail. I never went. And I always thought that was funny because I was the one doing the really bad stuff. He was in trouble for pan handling or sleeping in the park and not paying his tickets. I was literally picking the pink flesh from another man’s eye socket like a piece of pulp from my thumbnail and trying to find something to put the eyeball in so that it wouldn’t get crushed as I watched him get cuffed.\\n\\nNaranja was at the corner as I passed. Rufus smiled at me from the back of the car. The window was down, and he heard her ask me why my brother had just gotten arrested. Rufus howled from the back seat. \\n\\n“BROTHER?!?!?! Oh no! If that don’t beat all. Boom Boom’s my brother, boys, y’all hear that?” \\n\\nThe cops looked at me. It was more attention than I needed. I had an eyeball in my breast pocket, which I had to get to Jimbo’s shop ASAP. Rufus seemed to think it was hilarious, and when he got out a few days later, he told everyone we were brothers. Sometimes, I daydream of giving her grief for the irritation it’s caused me since she asked him that question, and I would. \\n\\nBut she’s dead. They found her body behind a dumpster several years back, stabbed in the neck, face, head and hands 58 times according to the newspapers and left to choke in a puddle of her own blood. That’s life on these streets. That’s how it can end, at any second. But, it is only a rumor (us being brothers, that is, not her murder. Her murder really did happen, just as violently and terribly as I’ve told it.) and one I’ve addressed several times before now, but in case I’m mistaken about that or in case you just never got the information, I’ll say it again. He’s not my brother. I’m not his. \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              We never made it to Florida. She’d been nodded out until we got to northern Alabama. Once we stopped there, she made me buy obscene amounts of candy and soda. She also asked me to check the oil when I put gas in, but she stayed in the car. There was barely any oil on the dipstick. What was there was black like coffee left on a hot pot all day. It looked chunky. I said,\\n\\n“Yeah. It looks great, baby,” from under the hood. I was about finished with her anyway. I could feel the monster trying to claw himself free from the box inside of my brain. She wouldn’t fair well, if he got out, and she pulled the things she did. Anyway, it wouldn’t matter once I got away from her whether the car was had oil or not. That would be her problem.  \\n\\nAfter driving 13 hours Gabriella and I spent the night in a hotel on the coast of Alabama. I rented the room at the office and opened it for her. The day had gone well. Of course, there was the typical bickering. She was always good for that. In the room, there wasn’t much heroin left, and since I hadn’t gotten a habit going since I relapsed with her, I let her have it. I was just happy to be out of Ohio where no one was watching the news that offered a reward for information leading to my arrest. \\n\\nThe blue and green flicker of the TV glowed through the curtains in our room. I sat on the beach in the moonlight and listened to the surf breaking on the sand and thought about Oregon and Arizona. I had never been to either state and both had cities where the street life was happening, or so I’d heard. Arizona would be warmer and drier. Oregon had a certain pull on me, even though it would be wet and cold. It was a place I’d wanted to go since I was a kid. Both had plenty of heroin according to all reports I ever got.\\n\\nThe prospect of leaving her and going back to the streets put a warm lump of hope or nostalgia or something sentimental, and I walked back to the room. She was sleeping when I opened the door. A movie played on HBO. I fell asleep quickly.\\n\\nNow, I don’t know where she got the clothes iron, but she did. She may have brought it. It may have been a part of the room. I’m not sure about where it came from. I just know that the distinct sound of my own skin’s moisture popping against the hot metal held to my forehead woke me up that morning. Gabriella was up. We had no connections in Alabama. I’d lied about Florida. So, she burned me with the iron. I can’t say it wasn’t expected, or at least something like it.\\n\\nI pulled my pants on. I ran for the door. Rain fell in freezing drops the size of grapes from the sky and a wind ripped up the street as I walked faster. Everything with her and leaving my sister and being so weak caught up to me, and as hard as I fought it, I cried. I bawled in the rain walking down the street in just my jeans. A car pulled up behind me and then slowly creeped along with me. Maybe they would help. Maybe they’d have an answer or ask me to get in and take me far away from my life and myself and everything else I hated so much and couldn’t figure out, but when I turned towards them, a middle-aged man with a crew cut leaned over the steering wheel to see past his wife, who was gawking from the passenger seat. A child pointed and smiled from the back. I moaned pathetically and reached out towards them and stumbled to put my face to the window and beg for their help.  It was as if I could sense their humanity bubbling up within their chests so that they would, so that they must help this pitiful, half naked creature crying like a child in the freezing rain -- me. \\n\\nMy senses must have been wrong, though. The mother reached back to hide the child’s eyes from seeing me, and the engine revved. Tail pipe blasted smog at my face. Tires splashed cold gutter water all over me. I cried harder and decided to walk back to the hotel. At least there, I would be able to sit on the balcony outside of the room where it was dry. Maybe Gabriella would let me in. \\n\\nThe curtains were closed. The lights were off from what I could tell. It looked like no one was in the room when I got back. I leaned over the railing and let my tear drops fall to the pavement below. A one-story drop wouldn’t even break my legs, maybe sprain an ankle, but there was no way I could expect the fall to kill me. Then, I looked towards the sea. I’ve never been a very good swimmer. The storm had caused the waves to break violently against the shore. All I would have to do is swim towards the horizon for as long as I could. There was no way I would be able to make it back. \\n\\nBefore I could make the stairs, a pair of young black men wearing torn white tshirts on their heads like bandanas met me as they were coming out of their room. They took one look at me and asked,\\n\\n“Whatsa poblem? Why you cryin’? You a mon. Don’ cry.”\\n\\nThey asked me if I was a “Jesus person.” They asked me if I liked “da Boy.” Both questions confused me, but soon I got it figured out. The answers were no and yes respectively.\\n\\nI said, “No. Not a Jesus person. Yes. I like da boy.”\\n\\n“Come in. You have money.” I think it was a question, like he was asking if I had money. It just didn’t sound like one. And I did have money.\\n\\nIn the room, they sat me in a chair at the small table against the wall and produced a brittle, brown brick the size of a wallet. They cut a bit off and put it on the table. I couldn’t even see what they’d given me, but I trusted it was there and put my nose to it and snorted. My eyes watered. I got queasy. \\n\\n“You like dat mon.” It was supposed to be another question. I nodded and stumbled towards the door and puked over the balcony. They didn’t ask for any money. They just said they’d be there if I wanted more. \\n\\nI woke up covered in the white beach sand grit. An angry Gabriella was standing over me. It was getting dark and had quit raining at some point. All I could remember, though, were the two Jamaicans or Haitians or whoever they were pulling me into their room. Gabriella said I needed to go pay for another night. She’d been locked out and looking for me all day, so she said. I could tell by her voice that she’d gotten something somewhere. Maybe all the dope she didn’t do or share with me from the day before. I don’t know. \\n\\nThe next morning started off better. It was sunny and warmer. She didn’t wake me up by burning the skin off my face or turned any other appliances into medieval torture devices. She hadn’t started a fight, even. We went to breakfast at a diner down the street. I wore a pair of cheap aviators I’d stolen from a gas station a few days before. In my mind, somehow, the glasses were a disguise to keep people from noticing the piece of burned flesh on my forehead, hanging off like a gnarly piece of dried out pepperoni, all curled up and black and green and crusty. It didn’t work. The glasses only covered my eyes. I knew that. The waitress and anyone else who saw me that morning did a double take and stared awkwardly at it when they talked to me. A fatter man and his pretty wife at another table gave me a look of understanding, like he knew exactly what had happened when he saw it. It made me feel better though, to wear the glasses. So, I did. \\n\\nWhen we got back to the room, the two men I’d seen the day before were standing outside of the room. Gabriella was wearing those gym shorts that must have belonged to a skinny 8th grader, and they choked her thighs and butt that made it hard for men not to look. One man slapped the other’s shoulder and pointed at her as we entered the room. Inside of the room, she asked me what we where we could score.         \\n\\n“I know you were high yesterday, Clyde.”\\n\\nI told her to wait in the room and went back to the other room. The two men were standing outside waiting for me. There were 50 bucks left in my pocket, and they gave me a generous portion of the fuzzy looking granules in three gel caps for it. That was the last of the money. \\n\\n“Hey, mon, we like you chick.”\\n\\n“You just don’t know here well enough, then, mon.” I laughed, trying to do my best islander accent. They didn’t understand. \\n\\n“We pay. We take her. Our boat comes at sunrise, tomorrow.” They didn’t want her for the night. I’d never had a chick like that long enough to let one pay for our dope that way anyway, but they wanted something more permanent. \\n\\n“Let me think about it. I’ll come see you later.”\\n\\nThe truth is that I would have never sold Gabriella to the Haitians or Jamaicans or whatever they were. She was terrible to me. The last two or three days, though, were good. Well, they were okay, and you’d have to forget about the incident with the iron to say that. Something inside of me loved her still. Something inside of me wanted to make it work with her and held onto the moments when she was just a little less crappy than others so that it could work. Maybe, I was just weak. Anyone else would have left her. I never would have. There’s no question about it, but Boom Boom on the other hand, well, that he’s a different story. \\n\\nShe did most of the dope in the capsules. I only did a little and got sick. Gabriella woke me up in the middle of the night. She was naked and sweet and sweating soon after that. We had fun. We shared a cigarette in bed, glistening in the dark and blew smoke at the ceiling. She started a shower. *This was it.* I thought. *This was love.* She was not who she’d been, really. I’d finally found it, the thing called love, that I’d so desperately pined for. My mother was all I had ever known of it, and she was gone. A warm spring of hope and happiness babbled in my chest. Angels were singing. This was love, but in the shower, she farted in my mouth, again. She even laughed, like it was cute.\\n\\nNow, it’s always difficult explaining the whole Boom Boom thing to people, because obviously, he and I exist in the same body. It’s just not clear exactly where the line is drawn. There are somethings about Clyde, that are the same about Boom Boom. So, maybe, it’s not necessarily two distinct personalities but severely altered versions of the same person. Like I said, it’s difficult to explain, and it’s also difficult to know exactly when the line is crossed from Clyde to Boom Boom or Boom Boom to Clyde. I just know it was some time after she farted in my mouth in the shower and laughed.\\n\\nShe watched TV. I told her I’d be back with some more heroin and went to visit the men. They were up. The payment filled a cigarette cellophane so fully that when I melted it shut at the top with my lighter, some of the dope got melted into it. I wrapped it in a napkin for safety, deciding to revisit the packaging situation once Gabriella was gone.\\n\\n“Babes, look what they gave me!”\\n\\n“WHAT! No way!”\\n\\n“Yeah. The guys are just a few doors down. They say they want to meet you personally. I gotta take a dump, though, so just go on over. You’ll see ‘em. Their door is open.” Those were the last words I ever spoke to her. \\n\\nAs the sun came up, I sat on the balcony. It was beautiful. I had walked to the 24-hour grocery store and bought a six pack of root beer in glass bottles. It was for the toast. You know, I would stick a needle in my veins with the most poisonous chemical concoctions you could dream up, if it would get me off, but I hated alcohol. \\n\\nTheir door opened. It looked like Gabriella was lethargic from whatever drugs she’d done with them, but it was hard to tell. She had a pillowcase over her head and duct tape around her neck. Her hands were bound behind her back, and the men were strong besides. She didn’t give much fight physically, but for a few kicks here and there. I could hear her muffled screams. I imagined she was saying my name. \\n\\nThere was a buzzing in the distance getting louder and closer all the time. Eventually, a rickety long boat made of what looked like trash pushed onto the shore from the water. The men took Gabriella, gagged and bound, over their shoulders and into the boat. I lifted my bottle of root beer to the men. They waved back, and the driver let off his horn. That was our toast. \\n\\nI don’t know whatever happened to her. Maybe, she lives still in some Haitian rape dungeon. Maybe, she was chopped up into pieces and sold for the price of her organs. I don’t know. I don’t care, but I do know that I remembered that notebook with the stories in it, as the boat road off into the vast expanse of the see. It was in the car, so I went to get it. \\n\\nI opened it on the hood and let the sun warm my neck and head as I read the last story in it. My palms were on the car and fingers splayed. It was called, “I’ll never see that house again.” Whoever wrote it must have written it about their grandmother and her house. It went like this.\\n\\n*I’ll never see that house again.* \\n\\n*And I won’t see her either.*\\n\\n*We spent every summer there and, in the mornings, she cooked pancakes in bacon grease from a mason jar or biscuits and sausage with strawberry preserves. We drank cold milk from the plastic cups from the shelf under her set of olive-green colony glass tea tumblers she’d had since the 1970s.*\\n\\n*We watched cartoons with older cousins after breakfast or made tree forts anywhere on the five acres she kept sequestered from the new neighborhoods and traffic with trees and brush. There was a club house on the side of the garden in the field. It had windows and a door. It was where our uncle molested us.*  \\n\\n*It was where my own father grew up, way back when the road was only one lane and made of gravel. He told me the front yard had been a dense, dark forest of cane when he was a kid. That was hard to believe. He told me the day he came home from the hospital, the pipes froze at the house and his head had been mangled by the forceps they used to deliver him. “I always wondered what my daddy thought that day,” he used to tell me, not that he remembered it, but he knew the story. “I always wondered what my daddy thought, coming home from the hospital, his son looking like some purple, smashed face monkey with a busted head and ice all over the kitchen floor.” Things had been different then.*\\n\\n*My grandmother cut her own field until the day she broke her leg. She slipped on a clip from a clothes hanger at the department store looking for a deal. It was the end of her. Physical therapy had been too much. She never got out of the wheelchair. Eventually, one of her eyes went caddywompas—in her own words—meaning it went sideways while the other looked straight. We suspected it was from all the Tab she drank in the 1980s. Too much aspartame.*\\n\\n*She was known to cry over nothing. Once she started weeping at the kitchen sink, because there was an airplane in the sky out the window and the people inside of it had just said goodbye to all the people they loved before boarding. Her face was as ugly as a face can get when it came to crying.*  \\n\\n*She liked to say, “Well, ain’t that a bunch of sh\\*t.” It usually was.* \\n\\n*She accused people of “flim flamming her.” They usually were.* \\n\\n*She accused the grandkids of always being one step ahead of her. We definitely were.*\\n\\n*She used to sip Diet Coke from a glass and chew ice cubes or chewing a toothpick when she sat on her love seat next to a pile of outdated tabloids. She sowed all the curtains in the house, in the 60s. She told me how she’d set the kitchen on fire once and how the finish on the cabinets wasn’t the original. It had all been burned off in the fire.* \\n\\n*She died though. Rolled that wheel chair to the end of her long hallway, crawled into bed and died.* \\n\\n*Was it cold?* \\n\\n*Was she scared?* \\n\\n*Did she cry out or did something visit her when it happened?* \\n\\n*Now, her children are selling the property and house. It’s five acres. A strange redhaired couple with an Indonesian financer came to look at it. They wore collared shirts that had emblems of two triangles and the letter S running through them. The place will be sold to Scientologists. It will be one of their compounds.* \\n\\n*I can see her now, sitting on her love chair and looking up from the paper to say, “Ain’t that a bunch of sh\\*t?”*  \\n\\nWhen I finished the story, I turned around and fell back onto the hood of the car. A skinny blond woman in flip flops and shorts with a large, Fleur delis tattoo on her shoulder and a red skinned, kinky haired baby in her arms asked me for a cigarette. \\n\\n“Sure. They’re in my room, though. You’ll have to follow me.”\\n\\n“K.” She waited outside of the door. Her eye was swollen shut and turning a shiny greenish black color. “Are you leaving town?” She asked.\\n\\n“Yeah.”\\n\\n“Where you going?”\\n\\n“Not sure.”\\n\\n“Can you take me with you?”\\n\\n“I think so.”\\n\\n“Good. I need it. What’s your name anyway?”\\n\\n“My name is…..” I was about to say Clyde, but I adjusted, “You can call me Boom Boom.”\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           (SO NOT REALLY SURE IF THIS WILL WORK AS A PIECE OR STORYLINE.)\\n\\nI walked back into the living room. I put her phone on the lamp stand next to me and grabbed the lighter to light my joint. It was easy to tell it was the good stuff by the spongey bounce it had when I pinched it to smoke. I took a few hits. That was all I ever needed. Weed had a weird way of making me feel almost like I was tripping on acid or something. It wasn’t always like that, but once I started getting hard into heroin and meth and everything else, I got weird when I smoked.  \\n\\nThe joint Victor gave me put me there. I opened the notebook that I’d found in the attic at the job. The second story started with the title, “My Boy.” It was written in a different color ink than the story about the cabinetmaker and slightly different handwriting. It went like this:\\n\\n  *His mother, my wife, left in a cab at six on a Wednesday morning.* *Some of her friends from college had booked rooms at a hotel in San Miguel de Allende.* *They had big plans to do the same thing they’d always done since college, drink wine, smoke pot and laugh like idiots.* *There was also a conference showcasing works by artists from across Mexico.* *That was the kind of thing my wife loved to do, so two weeks before the planned date they called my wife to see if she would be able to make it.* *We talked about it.* *Things had been stressful. I gave her the credit card, and she booked a flight on the computer.*\\n\\n*While she was out of town, my boy asked me if his friend, James, could come over. I agreed.* *They’d been friends since middle school and even though they went to different high schools they remained close.* *It was Saturday morning besides.*\\n\\n*I liked James a lot, but he wasn’t like my son.* *His mother went through men like they were socks.* *His father was the same with women as his mother was with men, but he also had a habit of going to jail for assaulting them.* *He’d been charged with different kinds of corporate and governmental fraud over the years, and everyone in town knew it.* *James was the spitting image of his father, charismatic and funny and talented but dishonest.* \\n\\n*I caught them snorting meth a month or so before that.* *They always smoked weed which I was okay with for the most part, as long as my son wasn’t smoking it before noon and took care of business.* *Meth and heroin and things like that, though, were another story.* *I’d freaked out when I found them passing a rolled-up dollar bill and leaning over an old wooden chess board to snort lines of a crystalline powder.* *I’d watched through a crack in the door before I busted in.* \\n\\n*It scared me.* *When I was young, all we had were cross tops or black beauties, which were bad enough, but I knew that methamphetamine was worse.* *I screamed like crazy.* *I sent James home that night.* *It was always embarrassing to unleash my temper like that in front of my son’s friends, but it wasn’t the first time.* *I talked to him.* *I tried to make him understand that I cared too much to not be terrified at the idea of what that stuff could do to him.* \\n\\n*My mother-in-law needed to go to dialysis on Saturday afternoon.* *My wife usually took her mother to her dialysis appointments, but since she was gone, I’d promised to take her.* *And that morning, James was already over at the house.* *Things seemed to be well.* *The boys insisted on me giving them work for some money, so they could go to the movies and see some friends later that afternoon.* *I had reservations.* *Finally, I told them I’d give them 50 bucks to clean up about three years of magnolia leaves on the side of the house.* *They ran downstairs, grabbed a box of trash bags and went to work.* \\n\\n*I watched from the porch for a minute.* *My son picked up a pile of leaves.* *James had a bag opened and held out towards the pile, but when my boy tried to throw the pile into the bag, maybe 50 cockroaches popped out of the soggy mess of leaves.* *There were cockroaches on their faces and down their collars and shirts and pants, a swarm of them.* *The boys spit dramatically and ran away from each other, and it took a minute for them to regroup.* *We all laughed about it, but they got it done.* *They cleaned up a major mess of leaves, which was really a much bigger job than one I could pay anyone else to do for 50 bucks.* *When they’d finished, I was just getting out of the shower and dressed to pick up my mother-in-law.*  \\n\\n*I paid them 50 each for their good work.* *They were filthy and said they’d shower before leaving for the evening.* *When I got back from dialysis, my son was in his room sleeping.* *He must have not stayed out long, or so I supposed.* *James was gone.* *It was suspicious, so I opened the door and listened several times to check in.* *He was snoring soundly at midnight when I finally fell asleep.*\\n\\n*The next day, I started doing the math.* *If I had come home at 8:30, then he’d have been asleep for at least 12 hours by 8:30 that morning.* *It was 11:30 when I started worrying.* *That was 15 hours of sleep.* *It seemed like too long, and as soon as I opened the door, I knew.*\\n\\n*Maybe it was the lack of any audible breath.* *Maybe it was a chill in the room.* *Maybe it was the innate sense within my own soul that knew his had departed.* \\n\\n*The day he was born he weight 8 pounds 3 ounces.* *He cried immediately, and since his mother was out of it from the drugs they’d given her, they handed him to me first.* *He stopped crying.* *His little body wriggled in my arms, and again, there was that innate sense of recognition between us.* *I could tell he knew that I was his father, and that moment changed my life.* *That day marked the rest of my life in away not even my own marriage had, but as I stepped closer to the bed on that Sunday morning, there was no movement. I thought about the moment he’d asked if James could come over. I thought about pulling those two 50 dollar bills out of my wallet the day before and handing them over to the boys.* *I thought about his mother.* \\n\\n*He was my boy.* \\n\\n*And we buried him.* \\n\\nThe second story in that notebook didn’t feel good. It reminded me of my own father, who was a bastard, but still strong sentiment had been invoked. The weed didn’t help. Life with Gabriella was in general a desperate and miserable affair besides. She was still nodded out and standing up in the kitchen.\\n\\nI grabbed her phone. There was a number half dialed already in it, probably something Gabriella nodded out in the middle of and forgot about. The number started with a 1-800. I went to her browser and found pictures of myself running across the freeway with that bag.  They were the pictures taken from the back of the Chinese restaurant by that little black guy. \\n\\nIt became difficult to breathe. My heart flipped. My paranoia skyrocketed. There were phases of all the emotion. First, I couldn’t even think. There was just anxiety pouring through my veins like acid and strangling me. Then, I sat up. I decided that if the cops were coming, then there wasn’t anything to do about it. They’d come and get me. I’d serve my time. It couldn’t be any worse than life with Gabriella, but then, I wondered if she’d even got a phone call off. If she was nodded out and left the meatballs burning on the stove and the number was only halfway dialed.\\n\\nI looked back at her phone and smoked a cigarette. It showed me walking out of Home Depot from the security cameras. And a different security camera outside of the store showed me coming up off my feet to clock that loss prevention guy. The rest of the photos were of me fleeing across the freeway and the cars wrecking. \\n\\nThe article was short. It talked about the Home Depot employee being listed in critical condition with trauma to the head and those who had been in the car wrecks had suffered minor injuries. There was a large reward for information that lead to my capture. I pulled on my cigarette. The nicotine laden smoke rolled over the back of my tongue and sank into my lungs. This was no big deal. If I kept her plenty high and supplied until we could get out of town in the Focus, it would be okay. I would ditch her somewhere after all of that. \\n\\nGabriella remained stuck in that position in the kitchen but for the slight bounce of her body waking up for a millisecond and nodding right back out. I walked past her. In the bedroom, sleep came easy. A terrible vision woke me up in the middle of the night.\\n\\nAcross from the bed right in my line of sight was myself but not just myself. You know the way dreams make characters out of weird blends of the different people in your life, like someone in your dream might be your third-grade teacher and your mom simultaneously, and its hard to tell where or when they or if they even are divided from each other in your dreams? The vision I saw was half of myself and half Rufus, but the evil orange glow of the eyes and voice belonged to something else entirely. Something from somewhere else. My head had been severed, and the figure held it by the hair so that it could address me. He spoke.\\n\\n“Clyde? You’re going to let her do that to you?”\\n\\n“I guess.” My lip quivered. The image was terrifying.\\n\\n“She was going to turn you in! Where’s the Clyde I know? Where’s Boom Boom? Has he gone soft?”\\n\\n“N-n-n-n-n-o-o. Boom Boom?” I had forgotten all about the nickname. My life on the streets with Rufus existed lightyears from where I was then in that bed at Gabriellas. Now I was soft. The evil entity speaking to me from the dark was right. \\n\\n“You let her fart in your mouth?” It was true. I remembered. I hadn’t told you yet, because I was embarrassed about it. But I’ll spare the details of what exactly we were engaged in that allowed her to squeeze one of those wandering ghosts out of her wheezy colon and directly into my mouth. You can probably guess. Whatever that was talking to me, already knew.  “She farted in your mouth Clyde.”\\n\\n“What am I supposed to do?”\\n\\n“I don’t know. Here’s an idea.” With its other hand, the figure pulled a 2x4 with seven or eight nails sticking out one end of it. It was a crudely fashioned murder weapon. “I’ll leave it here for you.”\\n\\nWinter sunlight coming into the room the next morning gave me some peace. The vision of the man holding my head and talking to me from the netherworld about murdering Gabriella was just a dream. I could go about my day. My imagination had gotten the best of me, but when I pulled my jeans off the chair across from the bed, the chair the evil being had been sitting in, a 2x4 fell from behind it. There were nails through the end of it. I slipped my pants on in the kitchen. \\n\\nGabriella was stuck in the same position. That was a long nod. I figured she must have had some benzos or something, but before I woke her up and talked her into leaving town in a hurry, I pinched the fold of bills in my pocket. It should have been 200 for the drills plus another 130 after working with Vic the day before. It was enough to get us high and out of town. \\n\\n“GABRIELLA!” \\n\\nShe startled. She stood up and screamed at me for a minute but didn’t make any sense. I held the cash in front of her and said,\\n\\n“Let’s get high. I wanna get out of town.”\\n\\n“Why?”\\n\\n“Baby. It’s just time. I got some hook ups down in Florida. We can get some good stuff and live the good life on white sand beaches.” It was a lie. I knew no one in Florida, but the sands were white, at least in some places. \\n\\n“Are you sure?”\\n\\n“Yeah, babes. Let’s just get 100 bucks worth today. I’ll put some gas in the Focus. We’ll bust out of town, baby. It’ll be great. Just you and me. What do you think?”\\n\\n“Hmmm… I guess. I haven’t been on a road trip in a while. It would be nice.” She was still wiping her eyes. Gabriella was usually sweetest before she did any heroin in a day, so long as she knew some was coming quickly. “I’ll call Dominic. He’s up early and has good stuff. Do you have my phone?”\\n\\n“Okay. Yeah. Here it is. Before we go though, I gotta see my sister. I’ll call her on the way to Dominic’s. Maybe we can meet her at Wendy’s or something.”\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I’ve never told this story before. \\n\\nI wanted to, but it was hard to find a place to put it and as it was, there were too many elements that were too difficult to tie together for me to make it work. So now I have a chance. Most of it you have never heard, but there are some elements with which you should be familiar. For instance, you might recognize where it starts.\\n\\nIt starts in that second-floor studio in that white washed adobe building across from the jail. The one my mom paid rent for over the phone, you remember right? It smelled like hot metal. It’s where I dated that red head who liked to smoke her dope and tell me she was on her way over to see me hours before she ever showed up. It’s where I met Danielle. I’m sure you remember her, but now that I think about it, I don’t know if I ever told you that it smelled like hot metal. Anyway, now you know. It smelled like hot metal, and it was miserable.\\n\\nSo, this dope dealing couple had lived there. Bo and Angel. That’s how I knew the place existed, and I had even tried to sleep on a pile of clothes on the linoleum floor with cotton fever there once. But they got kicked out, for several reasons, but one in particular was the morning that I sat on the stairs outside going up to the apartment. \\n\\nThe landlord owned and ran a local fast food place called The Chow Cart in the same parking lot. He saw me sitting there. His customers and employees saw me too. He didn’t like that. My friends told me later that he specifically mentioned that morning that raggedy bum sat on the stairs outside of the apartment when he was kicking them out. It looked to sketchy. He said it looked like they were selling drugs or something which they were.\\n\\nBut when I came along, six or seven months later, the old man had forgotten that he’d ever seen me sitting outside of the apartment or that he disliked my appearance there so much that he kicked his tenants out. He didn’t know that it was me. It must have been the crusty black scabs on my face that made me hard to recognize. They were a significant change in my appearance, or maybe it was the fact that the place had been for rent since he kicked Angel and Bo out and needed money. Either way, he let me live there. His son sat me down at one of the tables in the restaurant and went over a list of rules that we both signed. Then, he gave me the key and took me up to the room. It was miserable, like I said, but there was a TV left behind and free cable and a dusty love seat that came free with the place. Sleeping on that love seat did irreversible damage to my spine and neck, and when I woke up at 4 every morning dope sick and in pain from trying to sleep on the love seat. The Jersey Shore would be playing in marathons in the freezing predawn dark every day. A combination of the sickness and depression and the absurdity of the Jersey Shore burned the audio forever into my mind and emotions. The damage has been irreversible. \\n\\nIt only took the old man two weeks to realize that I was the same story as Bo and Angel, except maybe I was a little more desperate than they had been. I stole the coffee can of gravel my downstairs neighbor kept outside of his door and used for an ash tray.  He was the landlord’s nephew and manager at the restaurant. That never looks good. Even Bo and Angel hadn’t done that. \\n\\nAnyway, the old man told me I had to go in the parking lot between my building and the restaurant one morning before it opened. He found one of his customer’s wallets in the snow while we were talking about it. He was an honest man. I tried to talk him into giving the wallet to me as if I were somehow better suited to take care of it and make sure his customer got it. I don’t know what I was thinking, but he seemed horrified. Danielle and Mike came over to help me move out a few days later and stash the TV in the snow behind a store. I left the place spotless, literally. I crawled backwards out of the place with two rags wiping up my foot prints as I left. \\n\\nNow, when Bo and Angel moved out of that same apartment the spring before, they ended up living with this couple in a double wide on the south side of town. We’ll call this couple, Gary and Cherry, to protect them or whatever. I remember when Angel told me about how nice Cherry had been to her on the phone before they moved in. I imagine the conversation went something like this,\\n\\n“*Oh, Cherry, you know life’s so crappy.* *We’ve just endured (insert long list of unfortunate circumstances associated with severe heroin addiction and dealing, like: losing your place, getting diseases, losing another place, getting robbed, being sick, getting shorted by your supplier, the dope’s no good anyway, getting evicted again, etc.).”* This is my imagination of what Angel said to Cherry. That’s why it’s in italics. It seems plausible, but according to Angel, Cherry at some point actually said,\\n\\n“Why don’t you two just come home.” \\n\\nAngel recounted this to me with emotion conveying some sort of sincere love or familial bond between the two couples, especially her and Cherry, but I always recognized this kind of thing as totally bogus when I was addicted. No one loved anyone in the game. It seemed like things with Gary and Cherry might sour quickly for Bo and Angel in my opinion. And they did.\\n\\nWithin a week, I think, Gary had put so much pressure on Bo to give up so much dope for free, even though they were paying rent, that Bo and Angel left. Both couples could be heard around town talking terribly about each other. It was just like I expected, and however keen I had been to predict how things would go for Bo and Angel with Gary and Cherry, I was completely blind about how it would go for myself.\\n\\nGary was from Louisiana like me, but from the north. He had long blonde hair and snake eyes. I always thought he seemed like someone you see on those real-life murder mystery shows where some guy does something so heinous that no one can believe it, killing his family or whatever for insurance money. \\n\\nHe met Cherry some years before, I don’t know where, and he identified the tattoo on her hand as the symbol for Nibiru. They both loved Zechariah Sitchin. They knew all his books. They believed we were created by an extraterrestrial race of reptiles who bred their DNA with that of apes to get us. Our purpose was to mine gold for their atmosphere, which helped keep the heat in while it made its 36000 yearlong orbit around another star and our own sun. \\n\\nCherry had a big saggy belly and buck teeth and thick, thick glasses. She had two boys from other men.  They had Gary for a stepdad and Cherry for a mom, both shooting heroin, meth and cocaine in the back room and screaming at them for trying to talk to them. That was their life.  \\n\\nAfter getting kicked out of the very same apartment as Bo and Angel, I moved directly into the very same double wide that they moved into after they got kicked out. I lived in the small room between the living room and bathroom at Gary and Cherry’s place. It was okay at first. They helped me get around to rip people off and the different things I used to do to come up. I had some money. They had some money. Our favorite dealers got caught with a bunch of guns and dope and an underage cousin at their house, which really sucked, so we made a deal amongst ourselves to quit. We would get well one last time and on the first, which was fast approaching, Cherry would see her doctor with Gary. Between the two of them, they would get Cherry’s Clonazepam prescription upped from 60 one milligram pills a month to 90. When they went, they got it upped to 90 two milligram pills a month. We were in heaven. I got 30 out of the deal. Kicking was going to be easy. \\n\\nAnother thing I forgot to say was that the little Chevy Blazer they drove around in had no brakes. It had, until the day we planned to kick and got the huge order of Clonazepam, worked for us. There had only been one incident where we tapped a guy’s bumper at the gas station. He didn’t care. That morning though, we got back to the trailer, took our pills and once they set in, we decided we’d get high just one more time. I mean, what’s the point of having so many powerful benzos on hand if you can’t slap a thick tar shot on top of it to get you good and high? You know what I’m talking about. So we headed in the brakeless, green Trail Blazer to Walmart to meet Bo in his golden 4Runner with the back window busted out of it. \\n\\nWhile we waited, I ran into the store and stole two of the big boxes of Mike and Ikes, the regular green box and another one of the tropical variations, I can’t remember. When Bo showed up, we got high. I put a loaded rig with the rest of my dope in the green Mike and Ike box, folded it at the top and placed it in the door. We took off towards the back roads. Between the large dose of Clonazepam, however much Gary took, the shots of black we’d just done and not having brakes, Gary almost swerved off the road and then almost hit a cop. The cop turned around. We said there was no dope in the car. They searched it anyways and we ended up in jail. \\n\\nWe were being charged with felony possession. The guards beat me up and shoved my head in the crap hole in the padded cell for talking too much crap. I had nightmares, sweats, sneezes, all of that good stuff. After two weeks, the morning we were supposed to go to court, they come hand Gary and me a piece of paper each saying the charges were dropped. Gary called Cherry. Cherry had written a letter to our judge who had known her since she was a little girl and rode motorcycles with Cherry’s dad. It’s a small town there. They let me go, but it was a known fact that he’d planned and helped execute the escape of three other prisoners only months before. The DA couldn’t prove it. They’d come up with some other bogus charges and held him for three months. I walked.\\n\\nThat’s when I called Danielle, and she’d been held against her will by Mike and all that. But before we ever went to Justin’s or any of that other stuff, she and I went to Cherry’s. Cherry had taken my 25 pills and put them in her nightstand. She said I could have a few. I took 25. She got mad, and that night Danielle and I had loud and obnoxious meth sex until daylight. Cherry didn’t like that either. I found out she had been manipulating my parents, telling them that I’d caused her husband to go to jail and left her and her kids with nothing for money or food or electricity or any kind of transportation in the middle of winter. It wasn’t how it had happened. While I didn’t mind manipulating my parents for money or doing them wrong myself, I really despised the idea of her doing it. \\n\\nWhile I still had those pills and was doing meth with Danielle, I would go into bouts of dementia where I’d talk nonsense and not know where I was. Cherry wanted to get back at me, so she called my dad and put the phone in my hands in the middle of one of those episodes. I was saying something about Snoop Dogg, when I heard my father’s voice,\\n\\n“Riley! Riley! What’s going on? What are you talking about?”\\n\\nI snapped out of it enough to realize what was happening. Fat Cherry stood smirking at me in the hallway like she was waiting for a train wreck to happen and couldn’t look away. “Nothing, Poppa. I’m good.”\\n\\n“You don’t sound good, Riley.”\\n\\nAnyway, you get the point. It was ridiculous. After that Danielle and I would park outside of her bedroom window late at night and talk loudly about all the heroin we had and the Clonazepam we had and have loud and obnoxious sex until daylight. Danielle hated Cherry too. \\n\\nBy the time Gary got out of jail, Cherry, who was a 42-year-old woman, was in a relationship with my 17-year-old friend we called Tweaker Bird. They were completely in love.  Danielle and I were in a different state. Gary says he never knew about that or didn’t care, but when he and Cherry went out into the desert one night. They started a fire in a trashcan inside of an abandoned trailer. It was a bad idea. Cherry burned to death inside of that trailer. No one knows if it was Gary or not, but he’s never been to jail for it. We just know he was there. That was years ago.\\n\\nAnyway. That’s the story I wanted to tell you. Maybe next time I’ll tell you the one where this old lady shot her great Danes in the head for no reason and paid my friends 60 bucks to cremate them.    \n",

Inside I stared at the walls painted red and purple to make it look less cheap and listened to the soft jazz. The dropouts working the counter understood and let me drink the cold Baja Blast with a water cup. I pondered life and what could have been and what was not. Tourists stopped in to eat as they passed through town. Their kids complained that their sister did this or that and wanted to know the next time they would swim in the over-chlorinated pool at the hotel. I would close my eyes and imagine that I was one of them on a road trip with my family in late July. Back-to-school commercials on the hotel TVs offered deals on binders and loose-leaf and pencils.  Anxiety put knots in my stomach when the commercials played, and I could feel it all, like I was there and nothing had ever changed, like I was 11 years old again waiting to start the sixth grade. Then I would push the door open and walk the highway miles back to the Albertson’s parking lot looking for a fix.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 That next morning, things went as well as they ever would for us while we were getting high together. She woke up sweaty and desperate before dawn to rinse the spoon from the day before. I woke up too and watched. Her desperate attempts to get well reminded me that I had left a quarter of my bag in the cooker under the bed. It was because I’d been sober for so long. I didn’t want to overdose. I did anyway, but now, that caution paid off. Now, I had something that I would most definitely feel. It was a mistake to let her know that I had a decent rinse. After all her antics from the day before, I reluctantly split it with her. Gabriella didn’t deserve it, but she was beautiful. She was my girl. She would also make my life a living hell if I didn’t share. \\n\\nEven though the amount was miniscule, it was enough. I could feel it. She couldn’t though and was very vocal about how insufficient it was for her and how much of a waste it was for her to even poke herself. She never thought about the things she said to me. It seemed like she was completely unaware of how selfish she was. She had just begged me for what I gave her and wouldn’t even say thank you. You know, it’s not like I expected a thank you, but she could have just left out the part where she was super unthankful and disappointed.  \\n\\n“I thought you said you had a good one. What the hell was that?”\\n\\n“I did.”\\n\\n“What happened to it? It hit like dirt water for me.”\\n\\n“Yeah? Maybe it’s because you made me give you half.”\\n\\n“Whatever. What are you gonna do for us now?”\\n\\n“You’ll see.” I smiled. This was my chance. As often and as terribly as she disrespected me and made me feel so insecure about my manhood, her seeing me running around strong arming and robbing and stealing and fighting for her would win her over. Her opinions would change. She would respect me. “Let’s go to Home Depot.” \\n\\nWe got into her green Ford Focus and drove until we parked across the freeway in a different neighborhood. Then, I gave her the plans about how it would go. She wouldn’t get in trouble, no matter what. If they were chasing me and I couldn’t get a clean break from them to get into her car, I would take the fall. I told her that before I left. She was playing Candy Crush on her phone. She didn’t seem impressed. \\n\\nI put a gym bag I brought from the house under my thick hoodie and ran across the freeway. When I popped up off the grass embankment, I stood at the back of a small Chinese buffet that wasn’t open yet. My heart thumped in my chest. My breaths got shallow. Excitement pulsed through my veins and the freedom to be myself again made the walk to the front door and to the power tool aisle seem like only a half second had passed since I got out of the car. I opened the bag up and put it on the floor, filling it with the best brands of heavy duty impact drills, zipping it up and throwing it over my shoulder as I walked out.\\n\\nA linebacker of a man met me about ten feet onto the pavement and asked,\\n\\n“How you doing buddy? You wanna put my merchandise down and come with me?”\\n\\nI dropped the bag, but I wasn’t going with him. He was tall, so my feet had to come off the ground before my knuckles could contact his jaw. The man stiffened. He fell straight back. His head hit hard with a thump that made everyone look our way. I picked up the bag and ran. \\n\\nAs I got to the freeway, a small black man was behind me recording me on his phone from the back of the Chinese restaurant. I was distracted by that and stepped out into the freeway without looking very well. Besides, my adrenaline was running hard. A car was about to take my life, and all I could do was put my hands over my face. Somehow, though, it missed me and crashed into the car next to it, which crashed into the concrete barriers dividing the interstate. After those cars, a Landrover almost creamed me too but swerved and flipped onto its side and top. The other lanes of traffic were less eventful, and I never looked back to see if anyone was hurt. I just made the getaway.\\n\\nUp a few blocks and around a corner sitting in the driver seat was Gabriella.  I ran up the passenger side and banged on the window with my chest heaving and the bag in my hands. She would barely look up from playing Candy Crush and moved slowly to unlock the door from her side. It didn’t work. My door remained locked. After a minute of me frantically knocking and trying to open it and screaming that we had to hurry, she slowly reached over to open my door manually. I opened the back door and slid the heavy gym bag in the back seat before jumping in the front.\\n\\n“I’m not feeling good. I need some dope.”\\n\\n“What do you think this is?” I reached back and stroked the bag of loot, like a proud Viking after a successful pillage. Here was my worth. She would see it now. \\n\\n“It’s definitely not dope. And what in the hell are we going to do with that anyway, Clyde? Huh? We need money. Not whatever’s in the bag.”\\n\\n“Babe, we’ve got the next best thing.”\\n\\n“Money’s the next best thing. You’re telling me that bag is full of money?”\\n\\n“We’ll have money soon.” \\n\\nI had her drive us back to the house and used her phone to take pictures and put the drills on Craig’s List. The first one sold for 80 bucks. We made plans to meet the buyer in the McDonald’s parking lot, and when he showed up, it turned out to be a guy we both knew from the Friday NA meeting we went to sometimes. His name was Vic and told me he’d buy the rest of them from me for 200 dollars in the morning and give me a good day of work, if I wanted it. I told him I did. He’d be by to pick me up the next morning.\\n\\nAs I walked back to the car, I rubbed the four 20-dollar bills between my thumb and forefinger in my pocket. Gabriella broke her neck from the driver’s seat to watch the transaction. Things were good. Now, all we had to do was call her guy and drive to the trap. When I got into the car, she asked me,\\n\\n“Why don’t you f\\*ck me anymore, Clyde? Huh?”\\n\\n“Why don’t I………” I thought about it. There were lots of reasons. Bi weekly psychotic breaks. Her violent episodes. Her severe depression. Antagonizing questions and statements like the one she’d just made.  \\n\\n“You like boys or something?”\\n\\n“C’mon Gabriella. Knock it off. We got money. Let’s go get some dope. You’re being ridiculous.” \\n\\nShe called her guy. His name was Leeroy. We rode in silence, because for some reason, I was getting the silent treatment from her. At the trap, she said I couldn’t come in and then she took an hour to come back out. She was sweaty. Her hair was messy, and the collar of her shirt hung open like it’d been pulled and stretched by someone inside. I didn’t even bother trying to find out what took so long. I had a pretty good idea, but she seemed to be in a better mood, until I asked how much she got for the 80 bucks. Then, she showed me two small tinfoil bindles. It was a rip off. Before I could level a case about how badly she’d screwed me over again after all I had done for her that day, she started bawling. Her mascara ran. She couldn’t believe I was disappointed with her about what she got.\\n\\n“I’m just giving you what he gave me.”\\n\\n“Whatever. Let’s go home.” \n",

Everyone had these feelings and pathetic views of themselves, which may have been warranted. But feelings were like that half chewed, slobbery, soggy marshmallow a small child might hand you, excited to see your excitement about their gift, about the thing they are sharing with you. So, you fake it. You act like it’s exactly what you wanted. \\n\\nThat’s what it was like when people shared their feelings with me. I never wanted them to feel bad, but I also felt repulsed by it all, so I acted like I cared.  I acted like it was exactly why I had engaged them or why I stopped to listen to them, like I wanted to know about their feelings and weaknesses and all their crap. But I suppose more than anything else, if I’m being honest, I found the pitiful expressions of these other human beings trapped in the same vice as myself so distasteful and annoying, because I had the same things going on inside of me. There was no more reputation to hide my weaknesses behind. My shortcomings would no longer disappear under the invisibility cloak of a thick tar shot, and no matter how hard I tried to pretend that I didn’t, I had feelings too. \\n\\nFeelings were disgusting. They embarrassed me.   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          She nodded out. I asked questions. She woke up. She nodded out again. Gabriella never gave me an answer. And now that I think about it, I wasn’t really asking questions. I was just repeating the number five over and over with varying mixtures of incredulity, frustration and hurt mixed in my tone of voice. Maybe that’s why she never gave me an answer. Eventually, our correspondence evolved past my one-sided exasperation. \\n\\n“Five?.......... I mean……. Five? Really?” This had been going on for well over an hour. \\n\\nHer mouth hung open and her chin kept touching her chest. The lines in her face softened. Now, she cleared her throat and attempted to open her eyes to address me. It was a failed attempt to speak and look sober, like she was my mother who understood the world as it was because she was an adult and I was her child who didn’t understand anything. It might have worked. Except, her eyelids got stuck, leaving them halfway open, and she croaked her words like a frog. “Yesss…. Clyde. Five. I mean. Duh.” Her forehead was slowly approaching the table cloth in front of her, again.\\n\\n“What were you thinking? Didn’t I buy them, Gabriella? Did you think four for you and two for me, might be fair?” I suspected she had gotten more than the six she reported back to me with anyway, but I had no proof. \\n\\n“It was fair. Okay? You know it was fair.”\\n\\n“How was it fair?”\\n\\n“I don’t know, Clyde. Okay?”\\n\\n“I’m just asking because you said it was fair. How is it fair for you to do five and leave me one, when I bought all of them?”\\n\\n“I mean….. Well, look. You didn’t have to deal with some wannabe junkie poser boy overdosing in your house, now did you?” She knew how to get at me.\\n\\n“Wannabe junkie poser boy?” \\n\\n“Yeah. Oh look. He does one bag. And OOOOOHH NOOOO!! Overdoses. Like a punk.” She was extremely high. Opiates made her mean.\\n\\n“What about that? You didn’t do anything. You really thought I was overdosed and you just sat there?”\\n\\nShe put her hands over her head and squeezed her eyes shut dramatically. “What was I supposed to do, Clyde? Huh?”\\n\\n“I don’t know. Call 911 or something. Pour water on me or slap me. I don’t know! Anything!”\\n\\n“Well, I would have, but every time I woke up, I thought for sure you were dead. You know what kind of crap that it is to put on someone when they’re high, Clyde? Huh? Do ya?” \\n\\nI thought to myself, sarcastically. *I had not considered that my sudden and accidental death in her presence at her house might be a major inconvenience.* *Besides, she thought I was dead.* *I mean, there would have been no real reason to call at that point.* \\n\\n“Every time I woke up from my nod, you were over there dead on the floor, for all I knew. You kept screwing with my high. That’s why I had to do five. Is it really that hard to understand? Besides, I don’t have anything to do with why you’re doing heroin now anyway, Clyde. You’re a man. Own up.” She slumped forward. A strand of drool formed quickly and hung from her lip and chin.  \\n\\n*Didn’t you make the call and then drive us to meet YOUR guy this morning?* *Didn’t you throw the typewriter out the window because you knew today was going to be your first day of sobriety?* I thought. *DIdn’t you have the bag of clean needles that we used hidden in a heating vent, Gabriella?* *Don’t you have at least SOMETHING to do with this?*\\n\\nBut that’s how it went with Gabriella. She was a genius when it came to squabbling and one upping and doing everything for herself while completely screwing and neglecting me. It never mattered how obvious she’d done me wrong. It was always, ALWAYS my fault. \\n\\nI walked to the back room and opened the door. The bed was cold. Too much winter air had come in through the leaky garbage bag and duct tape patch I had put over the window that morning. I wondered if the message I had written myself was still in it. Had that warning to myself, to get it out before it killed me, come to pass? Had that imaginary balloon inside of me bust? It seemed so.  The pressure and poison had become too much, and now, destruction would come. That’s all there was to it. Besides, Gabriella had done all the dope. We had no money. Sunday morning would be an adventure for us. The adventure for me was back into crime after several lame months of sobriety, peace and honesty. For Gabriella the adventure would be seeing me in my element for the first time. She would get to meet me, the real me.    \n",

hours we were together, that I couldn’t believe such a beautiful woman was with me and telling me that she loved me. She had beautiful, dark brown skin. She had a hard and pretty face, predatory cheekbones that intimidated and attracted me in a way I wasn’t used to. You know what I mean? Like sometimes the weirdest things about a woman can be so attractive.  For me it was that Gabriella looked so primitive and mean looking. I loved her cheekbones and those black eyes looking through me, but when we got back on the dope, everything softened. She was still pretty, don’t get me wrong. It just wasn’t the same as before. \\n\\nShe had been smoking it before I found out and finally gave in that morning she threw my typewriter out of the window. Now, she was back on the needle and had nothing to hide, because I was using too. It was the fabled and elusive China White that people did in this part of the country. From what I could tell though is that just like the inconsistent quality of black heroin on the west coast, so is white powder on the east side of the Mississippi. That first morning we got six bags for the hundred dollars I slapped on the table.  I did one and flopped out. My lips turned blue. It had been several months since I’d done any drugs, much less a potent shot of heroin. And that’s kind of how that goes. \\n\\nWhen I woke up, Gabriella had done the other five bags.  She told me she thought I was dead, which made me wonder why she never called the paramedics. Calling 911 and dealing with that would have messed with her high and interfered with her shooting up the other five bags I bought.  That was obvious. To be honest, I wasn’t even irritated about her thinking I was dead that whole time while she kept getting high and letting lit cigarettes fall out of her mouth. It looked like a whole pack had been lit one by one and set on the carpet by her feet. I wasn’t mad that she had almost burned the house down, but I did want to do another bag. I was mad that they were all gone. I was mad she hadn’t saved at least one more for me, and right then, I realized I was right during those first 42 hours when I kept thinking to myself that such a beautiful woman falling in love with me so quickly was too good to be true. It was, and this was the proof. \\n\\nSomehow, her doing the rest of the heroin and letting my cold corpse rot on the floor for all she knew and the mess of emotions and lies she’d brought into my life, somehow, she made it my fault. I let her. I mean how could I say that my being involved to this degree with someone so crazy wasn’t a reflection of my own insanity and unhealthiness. It was. It didn’t mean I was happy about it, and since I was resigned to the fact that I was crazy too, I stayed with her.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                          An old, orange lady who I called Garfield and a young African immigrant took care of my meds, and I kept them under my tongue until I got back to my room, where I administered them to myself through my PICC line. Whenever I took a shower I used a plastic card to try scraping the crocodile skin on the bottoms of my feet from the pair of shoes that made them smell so bad at the detox. At night I snuck out of my window and walked down to a trailer park to buy meth or heroin.\\n\\nMy nurses all knew I was high but couldn’t figure out how I got it, and the administrators gave me a drug test when the maid found blackened spoons in my bathroom. When they gave me the cup, I used the old urine I saved from before. One of the administrators came to see me the next day.\\n\\n“So, Mr. Chapman, when those results come back from the lab, you’ll be out of here.” Her tone conveyed disgust and rejoicing at the prospect of my expulsion. I was on my second round of antibiotics after the first ones didn’t work.\\n\\n“Okay. Well, aren’t you sending the urine to a lab?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“So, you’ll know what’s in my system, right? You’ll be able to know if it was heroin or morphine, right?”\\n\\n“Exactly. We’ll know you were doing heroin and you’ll be gone.”\\n\\n“No. I won’t.”\\n\\n“Yes, you will, and then you’ll probably die of the infection. Do you have anything to say for yourself, after throwing away your life like this?”\\n\\n“Yeah, I do. Get the f\\*ck out of my room and leave me the f\\*ck alone until you have those results! I’m trying to watch my cartoons!”\\n\\nShe didn’t have a response, but she left. I got caught smoking cigarettes in my room at night by one of the nursing assistants, but got away with it. Joints were harder to smoke, but I smoked them in the room too. They knew I used my PICC line to inject my painkillers, because it ballooned out where I clogged it and had to be replaced. All but one of the nurses hated my guts and wanted to get rid of me. The one who didn’t hate me spent extra time in my room watching Comedy Central and went to the store to buy me every flavor of Laffy Taffy. She talked to me about sex with her boyfriend and how he didn’t love her like she loved him. When she lingered awkwardly to talk to me other nurses would make up reasons to come into the room and check my charts or IV pump.\\n\\nBack home my family expected me to die, so my father visited to boost my spirits and maybe spend some of our last time together. I didn’t know that’s what they thought, but my father had concluded from everything he heard that I would be lucky to live. He brought a carnival king cake from Louisiana to the nurses. At Buffalo Wild Wings we split a six-piece of wings and an appetizer of spinach dip, which was different. I always ate a lot of food and quickly, but the regimen of dilaudid and morphine and the hospital bed suppressed my appetite. My stomach had shrunk so that I could barely eat, and my dad attributed my lethargy and lightheadedness to anemia. He made me get my hair cut and beard shaved off. When I got back to the home, an older nurse said, “Boy! You got me all turned on, and I’m black!”\\n\\nOnce he got back home, he told me over the phone what tests to make the doctors run and what numbers were good or acceptable and what was bad. We paid close attention to my erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which detects inflamation and felt relieved when it went down. My father saved my life for the umpteenth time, and after three months they let me go with an envelope of 12 dilaudid and a few prescriptions to be filled back home.\\n\\nI gave the nurses one last headache when I snuck out of the facility with my PICC line in. One nurse wanted to take it out, but I told her the next nurse on shift would. When the next nurse came on I told her the one before had already taken it out, and I left in a hurry. The muscles burned in my atrophied body, and I wheezed all the way to the bus stop. If there was ever an appropriate time to refrain from smoking cigarettes this was it, but I smoked at least three Camel 99s before I made it four blocks to the bus stop. In the airport bathroom, I mixed up 24 milligrams of dilaudid and pushed it down my PICC line, but my body only tingled for a second. Then I felt nothing but sober.\\n\\nBetween flights my dad called me.\\n\\n“Seems they have a big brouhaha over at the old folks’ home you were living in.”\\n\\n“Really? How do you know that?”\\n\\n“Well, they called us, pretty frantic. Did you get out of there with your PICC line in?”\\n\\n“Yeah. I still have it in.”\\n\\n“Sh\\*t! Riley!”\\n\\n“It’s okay. I’ll take it out myself.”\\n\\n“I don’t know about that. I think that’s dangerous. Let’s figure it out when you get here.”\\n\\n“Okay. Sounds good. We’re about to take off.” I walked to the aircraft’s bathroom, and it moved in my heart and through my chest as I pulled two feet of thin tubing out of my arm. It was probably a biohazard, and I thought about that before disposing of it in the waste bin.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Before my hand came off the horn, an old man busted through the screen door with a bob and swing in his walk, an exaggerated limp. The racket of the door creaking open and clacking shut mixed into his belligerent squawking. There was no one except us, but he made accusations. He muttered curse words under his breath like he was spitting in disgust and climbed into the passenger seat. Travis squeezed between us.\\n\\n“F\\*cking imbeciles! I’ve never seen anything like it in my life. Just a pile of horse sh\\*t!” Over time, I would learn that this was his default. Ninety-five percent of the time, he was this way, unless you had some coke or heroin.\\n\\n“I know. I know,” Travis replied. “I talked to Zeke about it. He said he didn’t know anything about it and blamed it on Christine. I don’t believe it, though.”\\n\\nSome drama I wasn’t privy to, but I found out later that Tom’s dog was missing. It was one of two times Zeke and his girlfriend, Justine, had stolen and traded the old man’s pure-bred Pekinese for a bag of cocaine to Freddy, a diabetic drug dealer in a dirty double-wide on the south side of town. He was unusually sweaty. His face looked like he was sucking a lemon, and the only hair he had was a werewolf patch on his right shoulder. Deep-pitted boils of brown covered his skin from his bald head to the stained waistband of his shorts. His shirt was always off. His health was always terrible, and he was always sweating.\\n\\n(Once after Freddy moved to the north side of town, I saw him getting wheeled into the emergency room. I spent a lot of time at the hospital back then, and since I knew he was going to be checked in for a while, my friend and I burglarized his house. It was blatant and my S10 ran out of gas a quarter mile down the highway. Besides the safe, with some silver dollars and a couple of ounces of high-grade weed in it, the only thing I got was rinses out of his dirty heroin cookers. That was the main reason I broke in. We walked up to the Conoco and put gas with the silver dollars into a milk jug. His neighbors saw us do it, but New Mexico is a land of outlaws, and cops are rarely called.\\n\\nEventually the old man’s dog got eaten by coyotes in the sage brush behind my house after he moved in with me. The old man had bad luck.)\\n\\n“Tom, this is Riley. Riley, this is Tom.”\\n\\n“The indomitable Turtle, they can’t keep me down! Turtle Tom Stone! Pleased to meet you!” His tone and attitude completely changed. It was a show he put on; after all he was an entertainer in Woodstock, where he lived before and used to do drugs with the bass player of The Band. He stood in for Levon Helm when he was sick, because they were both singers/drummers. Levon couldn’t stand Turtle, though. He thought Tom was a piece of garbage.\\n\\nWe passed a pipe full of green hash and coughed, crammed in the tiny cab. Tom coughed hardest. He was 73 after all, but when he coughed a weird sound came out of his chest, like a marble rattling in a can of soup, probably from the wreck in the ravine. Travis looked at me horrified. Tom acted like he didn’t hear it and took every hit he could. On his move to out west, he had stayed in a hotel in Iowa where the toilet broke in half while he sat on it. The water damage was so severe that they wanted him to go to jail. Somehow, he lost his U-haul trailer with everything he owned because of it.\\n\\nAs we finally got out of town, whatever heroin Travis and Tom did before they found me mixed with the hash to soften the lines in their faces. Their mouths hung open and their chins were on their chests. The silence of sublime sleep filled the cab, but for the hum of fifth gear. To the left a vast expanse of desert territory summoned my imagination. They said it was still the wild, wild West out here, so I listened for the busting caps of antique six shooters and the thud of arrows through the necks of cowboys, shot from the bare backs of painted horses. Somewhere in the distant dust was the war cry of dark men with long hair and a caravan of covered wagons burning. It was faint, but I could hear it before the road dropped and rose back up toward Colorado.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The light changed from black to early morning blue to winter white and back to black through the bedroom windows three or four times. I didn’t know. I only knew that a long time had passed while I lay goose fleshed and slimy under the covers. There had been sounds of water running through the pipes in the wall as I struggled to sleep, doors opening, doors closing, my aunt getting my three-year-old cousin ready for school and clanging pots and pans to cook for the family. I listened through the closed door. My uncle cleared his throat from time to time in the hallway as if angry slights at me and my detoxing presence on his mattress in his house. He didn’t speak much.  \\n\\nTerrifying visions of Jeff being scraped off the road into a shoebox or a demoniac version of my friend Rufus or my father snapping my mother’s neck until she flopped strangely and heavily in his hands interrupted every five-minute bout of sleep in the dark. \\n\\nI woke up after those nightmares with my feet on the headboard or walking up the wall and wrapped up miserably in the sheets. Tingly warm sweats turned into horrifying chills. The taste and smell of soggy cigarette butts emanated from what I imagined to be a gelatinous black mold cultured in the recesses of my lungs. Sometimes it was old blood or burnt match sticks I smelled and tasted, and the raw pink flesh of my sinus cavities seemed dried and stuck to the back of my tongue. I yawned. Droplets of water ran from each nostril. My guts had no ammunition as I had not eaten, but I could hear the pans again and my aunt cooking breakfast for her small family. However strange and alien the concept seemed to me and however much my new uncle probably hated me, this was my family. The door opened. My aunt whispered,\\n\\n“Clyde. Clyde. Are you awake, honey?” I moved slowly in the bed and moaned acting like I was asleep. It was something I had done my whole life when people woke me up, some sort of attempt at making them feel guilty for interrupting my rest. “Honey, we’re having breakfast. You need to eat.”\\n\\nI rolled off the bed. I spoke no words to her, but she waited with a smile. My left leg gave out under me putting me on my butt. She stood leaning into the room through the door and the yellow hallway light pouring over the back of her shoulders and head like some angelic vision, gentle and beautiful and full of maternal compassion. I fell onto my side and moaned, wallowing in burning muscle misery, fluid running from my face. Finally, I got up and snuck past her into the bathroom across the hall to wash my face. \\n\\nMy aunt knocked on the door saying, “Clyde. There’s a new toothbrush in the drawer for you. You can use some toothpaste. Hurry up, though, breakfast is getting cold.” \\n\\nI had pupils the size of someone who had eaten acid. The mirror was not my friend. Cold water helped rub the film of filth from my skin, and it burned when I urinated, probably just from getting everything up and working again versus venereal disease. Orange pee sunk directly to the bottom of the toilet bowl, instead of dispersing throughout the clear water and smelled like sugar smacks.  \\n\\nWalking into the smoky kitchen, my uncle looked up from feeding and talking sweetly to my little cousin and scowled at me. My cousin threw her syrupy hands up towards me. She was excited. She said,\\n\\n“Hi, Cwyde! I’m Bonnie. I’m your widdle cousin, Cwyde!” \\n\\nI smiled, which hurt my face and head to do.  My uncle avoided looking at me any more than he had to by insisting Bonnie eat some more and focusing on feeding her. My aunt put a pancake on a plate and a piece of bacon with a fork and handed it to me.\\n\\n“There’s a glass in the cupboard there. Help yourself. Milk’s on the table.” She turned towards the faucet running water over a mixing bowl and the pan which sizzled in the sink. \\n\\n“Cwyde. I’m going to school today. My mommy’s going to work.”\\n\\n“That’s cool.” I said trying to sincerely engage the child in front of her parents, wondering if I was doing it correctly.  They didn’t say I wasn’t. It seemed okay.\\n\\n“Yeah! Are you going to work like big people do? My daddy’s a grown up. He says that’s why he has to go to work.” She asked. I had put the first sticky piece of pancake into my mouth and was pouring a glass of milk while I chewed. The question embarrassed me.\\n\\n“No, sweetie. He’s not going to work today. Your cousin Clyde is sick, baby.” My aunt interrupted.\\n\\n“Sick? Why’s he sick?”\\n\\n“He’s just not feeling well honey. He’ll go when he get’s better, baby.” My aunt turned to me. “Steve’s got a friend named Darryl who manages a warehouse. He said it’s really hard work, but the pay is good. It’ll be a good job.”\\n\\n“Thanks. I’m not sure when I’ll be ready to work. I don’t know when. Just not yet.”\\n\\nMy uncle Steve, who I preferred to think of as my aunt’s new husband putting distance between us and removing his position in my life as someone I needed to respect or care about, spoke the first words he ever spoke to me. “Not ready, huh?” He clutched the pink, plastic fork he was using to feed little Bonnie in a fist pointing it at the ceiling. “I’m not ready to go to work today, myself. Jolene, you think I could just stay in? I’m not ready for it?”\\n\\nMy aunt rolled her eyes at him. “Steve, you knew good and well this was how it would be. Be patient. Clyde’s going to get to work with Darryl soon enough.”\\n\\n“Darryl needs someone who can actually work. I’m not sure we know anyone who fits that description here.” He looked right at me. I took another bite of pancake. I took a bite of bacon. “Jolene, I’m taking off. Do you have Bonnie?”\\n\\n“Yeah, Steve. I’ve got her.”\\n\\n“Give daddy a kiss, baby.” He leaned into his daughter’s face. \\n\\nShe gave him a kiss. “I wuv you, daddy. Have a good day.”\\n\\n“I wuv you, too, little one. I love you so much.” He picked her up in his arms and squeezed her tight. I watched, angry at him and jealous of the love he showed my little cousin as her father. He set her down, gave my aunt a peck on the cheek and walked out through the front door. \\n\\nBefore the engine turned over in the driveway, my aunt turned to look at me and said, \\n\\n“Sorry, Clyde. It’s kind of how he is. He doesn’t understand.”\\n\\n“I get it.” It was a hard reality to swallow sitting at the kitchen table, my cousin looking up at me and having been humiliated by my uncle. I lost it all. Everything I had on the streets, the respect, the power to hurt people, the drugs and the freedom, it was all gone. Coming here had emasculated me in a way I had not been since before I left, castrated.  \\n\\nMy aunt walked over to me and put a hand on my shoulder. “It’s going to be okay.” She sat down next to me. “Do you remember you mother?” Of course, I remembered my mother. “You remember when you used to make all those potions?” I had gone through a period in my childhood of mixing up random liquids in cups and jars and calling them potions. “Yeah. You had quite the imagination then, Clyde. One time you froze one of those potions in a mason jar, but you were so little, you didn’t get it into the freezer well enough and when your mom came to open the freezer that night with no shoes on, your potion had turned into a ten-pound rock of ice and it fell on her middle toe. You remember that?” \\n\\n“I do.” It had been completely absent from my mind, like it was part of another person’s life and memory. Now I remembered it. It was a hidden parcel part of a life I had forgotten existed, life as a child with my mother and sister, when things were bad, but I was too little to know just how bad. My mother’s soft pale skin and the smell of the cream she rubbed on her sun spotted chest at night before we slept and the nightgown she used to wear. There were freckles on the backs of her hands and shoulders. When that frozen mason jar fell out of the freezer and broke her toe, it ballooned and turned ugly blue and purple and green. Eventually, the black toenail fell off. She was sweet and soft when she spoke to me about how there would be no more potion making, and she laughed when she recounted the story to people. There was the time we spent months in the battered woman’s shelter, and the night my sister wet her bed there. \\n\\nMy aunt continued. “She would be proud to see you trying like this. She would be proud to see you giving it your best shot and sticking it out. Don’t worry about Steve. He’ll come around, if you give it your best. He’s not a bad guy. He just doesn’t understand.” She looked at me. I looked at her. Little Bonnie stood by the couch in the living room and played with a plastic dinosaur and barbie doll. My aunt was younger, as I had always known her. Now her voice had changed. It was deeper. Her neck was thicker and skin looser. The creased wrinkles in her lips showed gave witness to her cigarette smoking. Her make up and lipstick seemed to cover up flaws, rather than augment her beauty to perfection like it did when I was a kid. “Anyway, I’ve got to get to work and drop Bonnie off at daycare. Your sister wants you to call her.”\\n\\n“Tammy? She wants me to call?”\\n\\n“Yeah. Her husband’s home from work for the week. They had a baby a month ago, but it was almost five weeks premature. She just got home from the hospital and wants to see you. They said they’ll come visit with the baby, whenever you’re ready.”\\n\\n“I don’t know.” I hadn’t known she was married or pregnant. A family visit might be too much for me in my present state.  \\n\\n“It’s your sister, Clyde. When’s the last time you talked to her? Before you left?”\\n\\n“Something like that. I think I talked to her on the phone when I was in that rehab in Nevada.”\\n\\n“Okay. Well, I’ll leave the number on the refrigerator. You can use the landline. Bonnie, let’s go baby. It’s time to leave. Clyde, eat whatever you want. I’ll be back before Steve, probably before three.”\\n\\n“Thank you, for everything. I mean it.”\\n\\n“I love you, Clyde. You’re my sister’s only son.  Before Bonnie, you and Tammy were the only kids I had. Remember, the number’s on the fridge.”   \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              I have a friend who never used hard drugs or the needle until  he was 31.  It was in a city in California, not allowed to say which, but he tells the story that he used the needle on a Monday and was sleeping on a piece of cardboard behind the Dollar Tree on Friday.  I'm sure his life had been falling apart before that, but it's just the way he makes it sound.  Besides, it seems weird to me that someone just starts shooting up at 31 and not just once, but goes balls to the wall homeless junkie status.  I'm sure it happens, but it's just not how it happened for me.  Anyway, he was the most hated individual on the streets where he lived.  He tells me about how he'd be walking up with a ten to buy a dime at McDonald's and his dealer would rock him in front of everyone for no reason.  My friend would just touch his face to check for blood and pick the money up off the ground and proceed to buy the dime, which the dealer would give him.  My friend would walk back to his dumpster behind the Dollar Tree and sit next to the piles of homeless feces and shoot up.  My friend would use his needle to pick at his skin until blood would be all over the cement next to the feces and him sitting in the middle of it behind the dumpster.  This was his life.  Dime to dime.  Everyday he woke up, scribbled some words on a piece of cardboard and walked to the corner to fly his sign.\\n\\nWhen he did meth, he thought his father was Tom Cruise and had abandoned him and his mother when he was an infant.  He did a thing he called Spinning Karate, where he crouches slightly into a fighting stance and spins backwards really fast throwing punches and kicks until he's just too dizzy to continue.  He has demonstrated his martial art for me.  The other thing he said would always happen when he did meth was that he thought actresses, Michelle Rodriguez specifically, would be telepathically telling him they wanted to meet up with him but were kept by some invisible force from doing so.  Like they would be drive by him walking on the sidewalk and speak to him in his mind and give him places to meet up.  But just before he'd get to the vehicle they were hiding in, that invisible force would come over them and their crew and they'd take off.  \\n\\nOne of the most common things he talks about in reference to that life is pooing on walls.  I guess if you lean your back against the wall and bend your knees it creates a semi-comfortable way to drop your turds on the ground without getting dirty and that's out of the way.  His mom took him to score once, and he had to run to poo on a wall because he was sick.        I've known him for a couple of years from rehab, and when I introduced him to my girlfriend who has had her own struggles, he sought to identify with her by telling her how bad he slept next to piles of turds behind the Dollar Tree dumpster and pooed on walls as a junkie.  It was the first thing he said to her.  \\n\\nAnyway, it all reminds me of the time I pooed on a wall.  There are probably more times than the one I'm about to tell, but I can't remember them now.  It was in December of 2005 also in California, but a different city.  One that is foggier and hillier and gayer than the city my friend lived in.  I had 20 bucks and was suuuper sick.  I walked down a hill to a place where they sold balloons.  I got one and walked to an alley up a ways, holding in with all my might the stinging, hot spray of liquid that was dying to get out of me.  In the ally, I ripped the latex with my teeth, unravelled the piece of plastic the tar was stuck in and dropped it into the spoon I had brought with me.  As I put a lighter to the bottom of it the black didn't melt right in the water.  I used the back of my syringe to move it around and get it dissolving, but it stuck to the white plastic of the plunger.  There had been another layer of clear plastic wrapped around the tar.  I tried to fix it.  I moaned from the pain in my bowels from the diarrhea I was about to spray all over the place.  Finally, it was too much.  I found a piece of cardboard, propped it up in front of me, put my back to the wall and spewed poop at the wall and ground behind my heels.  It was a terrible night, but I did learn something.  \\n\\nA black woman walking by saw me pooing on the wall.  She said,\\n\\n\"White people.  Only white people be crapping on these sidewalks.  Black people don't.  Mexicans don't.  Only whites.\"    \n",

                                                                                                                                            We lived together at Becky’s until she kicked him out for accidentally giving her 3-year-old daughter a burnt crack spoon to eat her Fruit Loops.  Not to mention his first week of living there, when he and I took Becky’s newest boy toy out on an all-night coke binge and left her with the kids at the house.  Doh-Doh missed a vein that night and got an abscess, which he drained a few days later with a knife that he bought at Walmart, after drinking a fifth of tequila.  Three of her kids watched him cut it open and squeeze the puss into the kitchen sink before he fell on his mattress in the living room.  He cried and punched the wall.\\n\\nWhen she kicked him out I left, too.  We moved to the Hacienda Inn a few doors down from where I detoxed before.  We worked every day doing construction and shot up lots of cocaine every night in our room.  \\n\\nOn several occasions our own bad choices reduced us to eating packets of powdered creamer and sugar.  We licked the granules from our greasy palms and smacked our tongues to the roofs of our mouths, desperate for sustenance.  Doh-Doh had a good point when he said they tasted better together.  On the job site another worker got mad at me for eating a loaf of soggy bread he had left there a week before.  Our clothes were less like fabric and more like some strange moss that grew on our bodies always damp and cold.  When I smoked I tapped cigarette ashes onto my pants and rubbed them in.  \\n\\nDoh-Doh did big shots of cocaine and stared at the curtains and held the syringe in his hand, cupping both of his ears.  Blood ran down his arms.  His dentures hung halfway out of his mouth.  There was no response to anything I said.  When I would hallucinate hearing the boots of the SWAT team running up the old iron stairs to bust us, I flushed our stash, and another time I keistered it and walked miles to Becky’s house at 3 a.m. to watch “Forrest Gump” until I came down.  Doh-Doh said it was a very rude thing to do.\\n\\nI told you before that the owner of the Hacienda Inn wasn’t kind to me and Doh-Doh, and while that may be true, we were not innocent in our dealings with him.  For a month or more, we flushed syringe after syringe down the toilet, until it finally backed up.  Water leaked through the ceiling into the room below us, and the owner kicked us out the next day.  He tried to keep our stuff, but the disgruntled employees let us grab what we could.  It wasn’t like we had anything valuable.  \\n\\nCarlos had just purchased a 1994 blue Chevy S10 for me with money my parents sent him.  We put the truck in my name, and Doh-Doh found me the next day.  It was around Thanksgiving, and our friends, a lesbian couple with a baby, let us stay at their place for the week while they visited family.  We did big shots of cocaine like always, and I almost burned the building down, afraid of the shadow people. \\n\\nDoh-Doh talked me into jumping through the neighbor’s window and borrowing the DVD player and flat screen without ever talking to the guy.  Doh-Doh said it was cool, because he had done a mutual friend’s taxes once.  I don’t think we ever watched a movie, but when the neighbor, his girlfriend and the landlord busted through the door, we had rags over our mouths and the room smelled like paint thinner.  I can’t remember what we said, but it’s hard to imagine our words were any consolation to the incensed trio.  The girl accused me of being a peeping tom.  It was not clear how she got that idea, but the stolen electronics in our possession and the solvent-soaked rag in my hand made me feel like I wasn’t credible.  I kept quiet.   \\n\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                        After everything my aunt was doing for me and the hard time her husband was giving her for it, I walked to the local AA meeting on a Tuesday night. She really wanted me to go. It would be a good place to bum cigarettes. Besides, getting out of the house was nice, and I liked talking to the other addicts. Alcoholics were nice too but seemed antiquated and out of touch with the chemical realities facing meth, heroin and cocaine addicts. Meetings are meetings, and they said the same things there that they say across the country. It works if you work it. One day at a time. Just let go and let God. One man stood up and said something like, \\n\\n“I know that I judge myself worse than anyone else. Do you guys know what I’m saying? We are always our own worst critics.” That was false. He’d obviously never heard me criticize or judge others.     \\n\\nA small blond girl with a crooked face stamped onto the bottom of pale and lumpy head smiled at me. She followed me to and around every meeting I attended and maintained a certain air of morbidity when we talked. I liked another girl though, a black-eyed Apache princess, who had a soft spot for green eyes like mine. Her name was Gabriella. \\n\\nGabriella took me home on a Wednesday night after a meeting. We sat on her couch. We locked eyes. We kissed, and in the morning, she walked around the living room on thoroughbred thighs and cooked breakfast. Her eyes opened wide when we talked. She told me that she liked everything I liked. We were the same person, soul mates, and fate had brought us together. I told her stupid things. I told her I wanted to be a writer. I told her that I loved her.   She took me to the store and bought me a Smith-Corona Coronet 12 Electric Typewriter because she loved me too. \\n\\nGabriella took me back to my aunt’s house to pick up my stuff, which was nothing but a toothbrush and a few pairs of boxers. I let my aunt know that I was moving into Gabriella’s house. She asked me not to. I told her it was better for her and Steve. She said I needed stability. I told her Gabriella would provide it. She thought it was a terrible idea, and she was right. \\n\\nGabriella was sobbing at the door when we got back. Black eyeliner tears ran down her face.  She fumbled in her bag for the key. I quietly clutched my toothbrush and boxers because it was obvious something serious had just changed. Inside, she walked directly back to the bedroom and flung herself on the bed. I sat behind her and kept calm. She cried until I fell asleep. She got up to start cooking a pot of meatballs at four in the morning, and when I woke up, I found an untouched bottle of lithium, a month’s supply, in the bathroom with her name on it. It was eight months old. \\n\\nThings disintegrated after that. We talked about her taking her meds, and she always promised to start. She never did.   \\n She was supposed to start seeing a therapist.  She never did.  I worked three days a week at a local Vietnamese restaurant. When I came home, she’d either jump into my arms and kiss me and tell me she missed me so much or she would be in bed crying or cleaning the house with chemicals and cooking large vats of food neither of us ever ate or sometimes she broke glass figurines and cups at my feet for no reason. However perfect we were together and in love and happy during her manic upswings was equally how disgusting and emotionally abusive I was and miserable she was when depression came on and things plummeted. I never knew what I was going to get. \\n\\nWe went to meetings. There were signs that she was still using and lying about it. I hoped for the best. I tried with all I had to believe she was still sober, but at a meeting one night, she started opening a bag of Sour Patch kids during the preamble and still hadn’t opened it when the meeting ended. She kept dropping it and getting stuck when she leaned over to pick it up.\\n\\nI had unintentionally acquired a white-haired sponsor named Dave. He was an ex-firefighter. Dave came to visit me where I worked, when it was slow. He offered a lot of advice. He liked to share his opinions, and one of my last days at the restaurant, one of the last days of sobriety and pretending life was actually going to work out for me, he asked,\\n\\n“So, Clyde, did you ever talk to your boss about what I said? I really think the place would feel more authentic if he had an Asian girl working the front instead of you.”\\n\\n“I told him, and he said he didn’t care what you thought. I think that’s about as authentic as it gets.” I laughed. He laughed, and in one second, I went from liking Dave to hating him. Something about his white hair and being retired from firefighting grossed me out and pissed me off, and I knew that our friendship was over. He was divorced from an ex-wife who hated him. Now I hated him the same way she did. \\n\\nBack at the house with Gabriella, I hid from her. On a Friday morning before I left, she admitted to using heroin and benzos. We made an agreement that she would stop the next morning after enjoying one last day with the drugs. When I got home from work she was sleeping it off, and I went to the back room to sit at the typewriter. The stress of everything with her and Dave and not shooting up anymore or being violent stifled me. It didn’t seem like it could work. As I sat with my hands and fingers poised over the keys, I imagined a large and ever expanding latex balloon inside of me. It held all my heartbreak, my love, my hatred, my violent proclivities, my weaknesses, my memories, my creative potential, my failures and marred images of myself. These things mixed to create caustic gasses and pressure in the balloon. I knew it needed to be let off, and I knew that this thing inside of me would explode and kill me and everything around me if I didn’t. I knew writing was the outlet. I just didn’t know how to open the valve. Before I went to sleep, I banged out the only words I ever wrote on that typewriter.\\n\\n“Write it out, Clyde. It will kill you, if you don’t. This is your only chance. It’s over after this. You’ve got to get it out.\\n\\nSincerely, \\n\\nClyde.”           \\n\\nBefore my eyes opened it had already begun. Gabriella chucked the typewriter through the bedroom window to wake me up. It was freezing outside. She was screaming. There was black blood running down her wrists and arms flinging droplets from her fingers as she wailed and foamed at the mouth. There was no way I would be able to focus on her keeping her promise to get sober that morning, while she was breaking down like that.  It took an hour to disarm the situation. I bandaged her arms. I pulled the hundred-dollar bill from my wallet, laid it on the kitchen table and asked her,\\n\\n“What can you get for this?” \n",

          \\nShe found me hiding out under a bus stop.  I was waiting out the prior afternoon’s freezing downpour and keeping the bearings on my skateboard dry.  When she asked me if I wanted to come home with her and that she’d pay for the bus ride, I obliged.  On her bed’s dingy sheets and in the dark of her apartment, she whispered words made of warm lung and toothpaste into my mouth.  I bit her lip.  The thin, plastic bag skin of her legs and stomach stuck to mine in the sticky heat under the covers.  We smoked in bed when we were through.  \\n\\n\\n\\nIn the morning I rifled through the cabinet behind her mirror and took a bottle of Xanax while she slept.  I took one and did a shot of heroin before walking down the hill towards Safeway, where I saw the soot streaked piece of Kleenex whose corner had been sopped in grease.  It tumbled in the wind across the asphalt.  I reached for it to throw it away, but compassion came over me.  I hesitated.  Was picking up this piece of what society called garbage, taking it against its will and tossing it into a steel can to waste the rest of its life, the right thing to do?  Society called me garbage.  There were special armed organizations who existed to take my freedom from me.  There was a metal can they wanted to throw me into, too, and keep me there to waste away.  \\n\\n\\n\\nI let the tissue go.  It was the right thing to do, the only thing to do.  The precious little Kleenex fluttered between my fingers before it broke free, doing cartwheels down the pavement as I pulled away from it.  My heart leapt. The movie of its entire life played out in my mind, a heartbreaking and inspiring cinematic achievement.  There were hard times, floating in the wind down desert roads and dirty streets.  There were seedy characters, and there was sadness in Las Vegas.  Love made an appearance in its life, just to disappear and leave the little tissue all alone again.  Tastes of fame and success came at a price no one wants to pay.  Alcoholism and cocaine wrought havoc in the tissue’s life.  Finally, the Kleenex found a wife and settled down somewhere outside of Kansas City to start its own family of little baby tissues, who all grew up quickly to become incredible Kleenex of their own making every bit of suffering in their father’s life worth it.  \\nBefore the credits would have rolled, tears fell from my eyes.  I lifted my cap and hand, cheering on my cherished tissue, celebrating the beauty of its life and all its potential as it tumbled elated down the pavement.  Towards the end of the parking lot, a well to do citizen of the city picked it up.  The stranger threw that piece of Kleenex into a garbage can.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI ran.  I tried to rescue it.  It was too late.  The trash was soaked and when I grabbed the tissue, it dissolved in my hand, all that promise turned into pitiful pieces of nothing.  Its lost its little life right there, and no one even cared.  Like me, none of those people walking around could care less if I lived and thrived among them or dissolved into nothing in a nameless grave of trash.  I shed another tear and walked away disgusted by it all.           \\n\n",

                                             When I couldn’t find anything, I walked back to the apartment building to see if my neighbor could help me out.  I had only seen him once, but he seemed like a junkie.  \\n\\nHe opened the door a few seconds after I knocked and told me his name was Tracy.  A man named Larry with big hair and leather cowboy boots had a knee brace and crutches and sat in the corner next to an empty spoon like a proud Hispanic rooster.  I spoke low so my dad wouldn’t hear me through the wall.\\n\\n“Can you get anything?”\\n\\n“You’re not a cop are you?  Whatever I get you, you have to do in front of me, so I know you’re not a cop.”\\n\\n“Yeah.  That’s no problem.  I sort of need to do it here.  My dad’s next door in my room.”\\n\\nIn 10 minutes, he took my 20 bucks out to the parking lot and came right back.  He dropped a black chunk in a small baggie on the nightstand next to my chair for me to see under the light.  It was exciting to know that my neighbor had a solid hook-up for heroin and cocaine as Tracy handed me a spoon.  I cooked it up and pulled the brown liquid through the tiny cotton filter and into my syringe.\\n\\nI had not shot up heroin since I left San Francisco, and the stint of abstinence made for a dramatic effect of the drug.  It was the same as before, only more intense.  My blood got warm and my stomach got queasy.  The constriction of my pupils, blood vessels and lungs made it feel like an elephant was stepping on my back.  Breath became shallow.  Words creaked out of me like bullfrog croaks and fell onto my chest.  My eyelids hung heavy and swollen.  My nose itched, and I got the hiccups before I puked in Tracy’s garbage can.  He told me to come back in the morning if I wanted more.\\n\n",

          Gustavo’s gardener visited us a few times, and one afternoon my dad and I drank beer in a crumbling hole of a bar with a dirt floor.  I demanded a younger patron explain to me how he lost his eye even though it humiliated him.  My dad told me to drop it, and I raised my voice.  At night, I walked streets of black stone hoping to find trouble.  And I did when someone outside of a bar asked me,\\n\\n“Hey, Gringo, do you want to knife fight?”\\n\\n“Yes.  With you?  Where are the knives?”\\n\\nI was calling his bluff as much as anything.  He yelled to one of his buddies by the bar to go get so and so and bring the knives.  I stared down at my feet in wet gravel and scattered trash.  All I could think about were my own blood-soaked socks and the despair of my father walking up to the scene if my throat were slashed.  It was everything I ever wanted.\\n\\n“What’s taking so long?  Didn’t you ask me if I wanted to knife fight?”  He pretended not to hear me, and I walked away.\\n\\n\\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Savage-Lost-Riley-Chapman/dp/1720741972/ref=sr_1_7?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1530492726&amp;sr=1-7&amp;keywords=a+savage+lost\\n\\n\\n\n",

the back room of Carlos’s house.  It was sweaty and miserable and sleepless.  A slight pocking of my skin had started in California, but now it was taking a turn for the worse.  It started on my arm where the witch bit me, and I swore it was a curse he put on me.  The rash itched and robbed me of sleep. It tortured me. It broke my already feeble mind. My legs and ankles visibly swelled, and three different doctors had no answer. What I determined to be a secondary staph infection created crusty lesions on my thighs that broke and wept when I lifted anything heavy. A round of sulfa-based antibiotics gave me some relief, but even if the rash wasn’t there to plague my life, there were other things breaking me inside.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe abrupt discontinuation of my daily heroin regimen made me feel everything my body was doing. My bones’ hard surfaces cut into my aching muscles, pulling and twisting every ligament. Instead of a spine with vertebrae, I had a stack of wooden Jenga blocks ready to fall. My guts gurgled when I swallowed my saliva. I imagined my brain’s synaptic firings discharged heat through my ears and caused a dull aching in my eyeballs. It was as if life had become an electrically charged fence into which I was slowly being pushed. \\n\\nMy feet shuffled across the floor in the daytime. Articles of clothing I collected from the streets covered Carlos’s back room in truly psychotic fashion. I spilled rolling tobacco all over his house and crept around the kitchen at night. His cupboard’s hinges creaked while his family slept. Solidified chunks from an ancient can of Ensure stuck between my teeth, and I gagged. It was my fault for compulsively looting his dry goods cabinet and eating whatever I found in the dark. \\n\n",

My muscles burned.  I grunted or moaned every step.  It was almost impossible to walk, like I had muscular dystrophy or something, and by now I was sure the lack of chemicals had turned my pupils to the size of nickels.  There was undoubtedly a layer of grease shellacked onto my forehead.  A single strand of snot hung from my nose in the wind and fluttered.  Still I shuffled towards the trio, determined to get that cigarette.\\n\\nI stood some distance from them.  I asked, \\n\\n\\n“Excuse me, but I was wondering if any of you could spare a cigarette.”  But they never looked towards me.  I tried again.  “EXCUSE ME!”  They continued their conversation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe girl had a big nose and thin lips.  She was pretty and rambled on the way the way pretty girls can with strange men who will give them attention.  Her boyfriend wore a backwards hat and cheap sunglasses while he stood next to her nodded out, like he was trying to touch his nose to the concrete.  The girl kept calling him baby. I spoke again.\\n\\n\\n“HEY!  EXCUSE ME!  CAN I GET A CIGARETTE!”  None of the three looked up.  My voice must have disappeared from the withdrawals.  The fat man just laughed.\\n\\nHe said, “What’s baby having anyway?  Shoot!  I want some of whatever baby’s having!  Haw haw haw!”  \\n\\n“Me too.”  I said laughing like I was in on the joke, but they didn’t hear that either.  I could only whisper in my weakened state and the remaining 20 feet I’d have to walk to tap one of them on the shoulder was too far for me.  So, I turned around and walked back towards the bus.  As my left foot slid onto the bottom step of the bus, a warm slime splattered and ran down the back of my leg.  The sickness was just too much.  There was nothing I could do.  No clothes.  No energy to change them, even if I had any.  For the rest of the trip, I stayed slumped in my seat like a soggy, stinky sock, sitting in my own mess, sneezing and sniffling and whimpering for the remaining 12 hours back to my hometown.\\n  \\nIt was late at night when the driver announced our arrival and I heard the release of the bus’s hydraulic pressure.  Somehow, sleep had come over me for a moment, the way it does during heroin withdrawals, miserable and fleeting.  Everyone else who got off the bus there was bantering with the driver and crouching to see into the luggage store under the bus for their bags.  I was wearing everything I owned.  \\n\n",

                                                    We stole a pack of shaving razors, a bottle of hydrogen peroxide, some gauze and tape.  I broke the thin blade out of one of the shavers and snapped it in half.  In the poorly lit bathroom she stood in the tub, while I knelt on the floor outside of it.  Danielle shook, and her lips curled in distress.  With her right wrist in my left hand I looked at her and said with a smile,\\n\\n“Now baby, I know that I look like one, but I feel like I should tell you that I’m not actually a doctor.”\\n\\n“Shut up!  It’s not funny!  Now hurry up!”\\n\\nI pushed the sharp side of the blade into the thin, yellowed skin on the head of her abscess.  A snake of black blood and green puss slithered down her arm and thudded in clumps on the floor by the drain.  She recoiled, but I held her wrist and pulled her back.\\n\\n“Now, we have to squeeze it.”  I pinched her flesh on either side of the bleeding wound and squeezed it.  More blood and puss oozed out.  Her body shuddered, and she groaned curse words.  We were high on heroin, but it didn’t make much difference for her.  It was painful.  I poked a hole into the top of the bottle of peroxide and sprayed a jet of the fluid into her wound.  It fizzed and foamed on the blood.\\n\\n“Okay.  That should be good.”  We wrapped the wound in gauze and taped it up and went to sleep.\\n\\nThe next night we went up to the strip club where she had worked a couple of years before. After 15 minutes of my waiting in the car, she walked out fuming and cursing back at one of the bouncers, and he screamed from across the parking lot that she was a junkie whore.  They did not want her back with a bandage on her arm like that.  So, we headed back to the town we met in.\\n\\nI wasn’t afraid of the death threats there, because if there was anything I knew about that town, it was that no one’s word was worth much.  The people who wanted to kill me would have to find me first, and even if they did, they would have to deal with me when they did.  I’m not saying that they weren’t dangerous people.  They were, but what I am saying is that when it came down to it, so was I.\\n\n",

heroin Travis and Bob did before they found me mixed with the hash to soften the lines in their faces.  Their mouths hung open and their chins were on their chests.  The silence of sublime sleep filled the cab, but for the hum of fifth gear.  To the left a vast expanse of desert territory summoned my imagination.  They said northern New Mexico was still the wild, wild West, so I listened for the busting caps of antique six shooters and the thud of arrows through the necks of cowboys, shot from the bare backs of painted horses.  Somewhere in the distant dust was the war cry of dark men with long hair and a caravan of covered wagons burning.  It was faint, but I could hear it before the road dropped into Hondo and back up toward Colorado.\n",

                                                                                                                                             I was living in this tiny desert town, way up in the mountains, about 80 miles south of the Colorado border.  My life was the way it always was as a junkie.  You know what I'm talking about.  I walked like 10 miles a day minimum, because this place had no public transit, not even a taxi cab service.  A lot of hippies lived there so thumbing a ride wasn't out of the question, but I was a junkie, so I walked everywhere.  And everywhere was way, way, way spread out, like super far away from everything else.  It was a desert town so there was no shortage of space when they planned housing.  \\nAnyway, at this same time, I was known at one of the local coffee shops as a junkie by the hippies who frequented it and owned it.  They didn't necessarily hate me for being a junkie per se but they did hate me for this one time they caught me stealing an organic fruit rollup and shooting up in their bathroom.  The owner literally used to chase me to the bathroom and bang on the door screaming that, \"IT BETTER SMELL LIKE SH*T WHEN I GET IN THERE!!!!!\"  \\nI still hung out in their courtyard anyway and one night, after a day of walking and walking and walking and getting a few good shots of black out of it, I was starving and dying for a warm place to sleep.  These hippies who had known me somewhat before I relapsed and definitely knew me now took me home.  It was a woman's house.  She was fat but very pretty and probably 27 or so with 4 kids.  She made money as a seamstress or whatever she did and wore cockroach killer cowboy boots and a straw cowboy hat.  At her house, which was the way things were for most hippied out single mothers in the town, there lived four or five other grown men and women full time.  Outside of that there was an influx of anywhere between 10 and 2 people.  This night I can't remember how many there were, maybe 12 of us besides her and her kids, but I had never been there before.  I only knew like one guy's name and another girls name, but there I was all nodded out and hungry and getting stared at hard between these hippies all beating on their drums and passing joints, which I sucked down every chance I got.  They would laugh at me for taking such big hits like, \"This dude is definitely a mooch.  He's just trying to smoke the whole joint every time he gets a hit.\"  They were right.  I was selfish.\\nSo anyway, the single mother in her cowboy boots and cowboy hat has baked like two whole oven racks of chicken breast.  It's beautiful, golden brown, salted and greasy.  \\nI'm not sure exactly what they were waiting for.  They didn't say grace.  They weren't Christians.  Maybe they were waiting for the rest of it to be done, like some other part of the dinner, baked potatoes I don't know, but they were all just waiting politely to start eating the chicken.  \\nWell I wake up out of this hard nod and walk right over to the pans with all this chicken waiting to be feasted on and I grab some a breast with my bare hand and start mowing down right there.  Grease was running down my chin.  I'm sure I was making a ton of noise.  I ate several more pieces before anyone else even stood up to get one.  They were all looking at me like, \"What the F, dude?  Who are you and why did you eat our chicken like that you selfish piece of crap?\"  \\nI'm hungry is what I would have said. Or maybe I'm the perpetually nodding chicken man?  I do'n tknow what I would have said, but I just walked to the back and found a mattress and crashed out until the morning.  When I woke up I walked back to town with one of the only two people I knew there, my pregnant friend Wendy.     \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Like so many of the greatest stories ever told, this one also begins with a dirty microwave.  The pitiful machine watched me like a terrified child from the corner.  I paced in the dark.  It was not long before I got crazy and stuffed her into a roll around suitcase to collect her ransom from some villains I knew.  The kidnapping was going well, until I got a greedy itch on the way to make the exchange and robbed the Scholtzky’s in the parking lot of my apartment complex.  It was 50 feet from my front door.  The manager and cashiers knew us by name.  My accomplice was an old, crippled man on crutches, and the suitcase had my all of my personal information on it when we got arrested.  It wasn’t my best day, but then again it wasn’t my worst.  Let me tell you what happened.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\\nI detoxed in the back room of Cheo’s house.  It was sweaty and miserable and sleepless.  A slight pocking had started in California, but now it was taking a turn for the worst.  I swore it was a curse the witch I beat up in California put on me.  The rash itched and robbed me of sleep. It tortured me. It broke my already feeble mind. My legs and ankles visibly swelled, and three different doctors had no answer. What I determined to be a secondary staph infection created crusty lesions on my thighs that broke and wept when I lifted anything heavy. A round of sulfa based antibiotics gave me some relief, but even if the rash wasn’t there to plague my life, there were other things breaking me inside.\\n\\nThe abrupt discontinuation of my daily heroin regimen made me feel everything my body was doing. My bones’ hard surfaces cut into my aching muscles, pulling and twisting every ligament. Instead of a spine with vertebra, I had a stack of wooden Jenga blocks ready to fall. My guts gurgled when I swallowed my saliva. I imagined my brain’s synaptic firings discharged heat through my ears and caused a dull aching in my eyeballs. It was as if life had become an electrically charged fence into which I was slowly being pushed. \\n\\nMy feet shuffled across the floor in the daytime. Articles of clothing I collected from the streets covered Cheo’s back room in truly psychotic fashion. I spilled rolling tobacco all over his house and crept around the kitchen at night. His cupboard’s hinges creaked while his family slept. I got solidified chunks from an ancient can of ensure stuck between my teeth and gagged. It was my fault for compulsively looting his dry goods cabinet and eating whatever I found in the dark. \\n\\nI reeled from the horrors I lived on the streets of California. Cheo’s wife would talk to me about this or that while she cooked dinner, but it always ended up with her assuring me I was okay.  She promised I would recover. It was like flipping through a book I knew so well, but evil was written where there had been good. Blank pages existed where maps of myself had once been drawn, and termites had turned the remaining pieces of parchment into confetti. \\n\\nI held my head in my hands. \\n\\nWho was I? What had I done? Something was wrong and worse than ever. I did not cry, but I probably should have. These were the pains of metamorphosis, which I never could feel on the drugs, but when I was sober, the screams of my own mutilated conscience echoed inside of my skull. \\n\\nI thought about my father and the things I did to hurt him. I thought about my mother and how she threw herself on the bed and cried when I got arrested at the house. I thought about the failures with my girlfriend and how disgusting I was. I registered for school and moved into the Warren Inn in the city.\\n\\nMy back felt straighter with the prospect of a new life in a new environment.  It was a fresh start.  Sleep was possible.  Pieces of my mind were coming back.  I was clean.  The itchy rash was going away.  Spring semester started, and I had a little girlfriend, so things were looking up.\\n\\nThe girl liked me even though, I had given her a Valentine’s Day card with another girl’s name scratched out and hers scribbled beneath it.  It was hand drawn, and I managed to rhyme violet with toilet in the poem I wrote on the inside. \\n\\nI told her she was beautiful.  She looked at the scars on my legs in bed.  We ate her birthday dinner at a Mexican restaurant with her family a few days after that, and her grandmother laughed at everything I said. \\n\\n“You’re a very interesting man!”  Her grandmother said.  \\n\\nShe seemed to think I was good for her granddaughter, but I smoked cigarettes.  I lay on a bare mattress in the dark.  I watched reruns of Roseanne till four every morning.  I wanted to burn my life down and would as soon as I got the chance.  Our relationship ended as soon as I found out that my next-door neighbor could score heroin and cocaine.  \\n\\nMy dad came to visit one weekend in late February, and it was a Saturday night when I told my dad I was going to see the girl.  It would be a good excuse to ask for 20 bucks and give me an opportunity to try scoring at the mall.  When I couldn’t find anything, I walked back to the Warren Inn to see if my neighbor could help me out.  I had only seen him once, but he seemed like a drug addict.  \\n\\nHe opened the door a few seconds after I knocked and told me his name was Tracy.  A man named Larry with big hair and leather cowboy boots had a knee brace and crutches and sat in the corner next to an empty spoon like a proud Hispanic rooster.  I spoke low so my dad wouldn’t hear me through the wall.\\n\\n“Can you get anything?”\\n\\n“You’re not a cop are you?  Whatever I get you, you have to do in front of me, so I know you’re not a cop.”\\n\\n“Yeah.  That’s no problem.  I sort of need to do it here.  My dad’s in my room.”\\n\\nIn ten minutes, he took my 20 bucks out to the parking lot and came right back.  He dropped a black chunk in a small baggie on the nightstand next to my chair for me to see under the light.  It was exciting to know that my neighbor had a solid hook up for heroin and cocaine as Tracy handed me a spoon.  I cooked it up and pulled the brown liquid through the tiny cotton filter and into my syringe.\\n\\nI had not shot up heroin since I left California, and the stint of abstinence made for a dramatic effect of the drug.  It was the same as before, only more intense.  My blood got warm and my stomach got queasy.  The constriction of my pupils, blood vessels and lungs felt like an elephant stepped on my back.  Breath became shallow.  Words creaked out of me like bullfrog croaks and fell onto my chest.  My eyelids hung heavy and swollen.  My nose itched, and I got the hiccups before I puked in his garbage can.  He told me to come back in the morning if I wanted more.\\n\\nMy dad took off that next morning like he had planned.  It was not the best visit.  Sure, I was off the streets, but when he showed up he had to take me to buy sheets for my bed.  My clothes, room, hair and life in general were more disheveled than he liked to see.  I spent 20 dollars he gave me on a haircut, but it looked the same when I came back.  He got mad and made me get another one.      \\n\\nBefore he left he hunched over in the wind and counted out 200 dollars for me in the parking lot outside of my building.  He bit his tongue, because it didn’t look like anything was going to change with me even if he thought I was sober for the moment.  \\n\\nMy life unraveled.  \\n\\nWithin a week something like 300 unopened condoms littered the whole room with heroin cookers, rubber tourniquets, baggies of cotton balls and alcohol swabs from the needle exchange.  Trash littered the floors, and a film of cigarette tar and ashes covered the windows and mirrors.  Feces piled high out of the toilet that had quit working weeks before.  I systematically broke into every car in the parking lot one night and kept the useless loot.  There was one half of a 20-dollar bill, three small bags of dirt weed, several briefcases full of what appeared to be dried out potting soil (if that can even be believed), a broken ironing board, and manila folders full of someone else’s old resumes, among other things.  It was all on the floor in my room that stunk and stayed dark like me.\\n\\nThe Warren Inn was full of sad people living sad lives who barely survived on food stamps and the crumbs they had left for the month after paying rent with their SSI.  That’s why the cars had nothing good to steal.  A crazy guy invited me into his room on the second floor of my building and read from a notebook some things he had written.  There were jars of urine and feces in the corner and an eerie desire to get out of there as soon as I could.  \\n\\nA middle-aged woman with bad skin lived across the hall from me with her boyfriend.  He had a withered hand and a limp.  They got into a fight one day, and she tore off in his van.  He chased her.  I ran into their room and stole a pair of boots, a jacket, a sleeve of generic Chips Ahoy and a sleeve of saltines.  Later that night, I tried to dine and dash at the IHOP but gorged myself on French toast so badly, I couldn’t run.  The next morning, I shot up a syringe full of cocaine and Tracy’s blood even after he told me had Hepatitis C.\\n\\nMy life continued to unravel.  \\n\\nAnother man lived in the building next to mine. I supposed he was a man, but there were things about him, like his breath and the texture of his skin, that made me wonder if maybe he wasn’t a clump of yeast and dough somehow become sentient. His motor skills and the air of his sophistication were on par with most three-year old kids I knew, and his dress only added to it: an old bomber jacket, cowboy boots, ear muffs and a pair of ski goggles to ride the bus. His only teeth stuck out his bottom gums, like two pieces of corn. \\n\\nI told him about surviving Katrina. He told me of younger days in a biker gang and presently bulging hernias. Gnarled fingers grew out of his knotted hands like the branches of an old cypress tree, attached to frozen wrists where the bones had fused together. \\n\\n“I’ve got rubatide arthritis. Had it for ten years, now.” His pronunciation of the ailment incited serious questions in my mind. How could someone live with such inconvenience? How did he deal with the pain? How did he have a disease for ten years and not know how it was pronounced?\\n\\nHe got me a spot selling newspapers, because the regular guy was sick.  A van picked us up in the morning and dropped us off at our respective locations.  It seemed to be more about putting a few quarters in the pockets of these decrepit liquor hounds, than it did about actually making money.  The novelty of notably destitute newspaper vendors on the same street corners every morning must have somehow been good for the press.  I just couldn’t figure out how. \\n \\nMy hands went numb, and everyone who bought a newspaper asked where Ray was.  Some people just asked where he was but didn’t buy one.  It took over four hours to collect seven singles and 13 dollars more in quarters.  When I did, I abandoned my post and walked to Taco Bell.  A guy tried to sell me a package of stolen razor blade heads at one of the tables but settled to rip me off by a canal on the other side of a chain linked fence.  He wouldn’t shut up about shooting up in the back of his hands.  I should have known not to trust him.  \\n\\n\\nLarry moved into my room, and whatever pomp he projected that first night in Tracy’s apartment had withered with his frame.  Now he stood on his crutches and stared into the bathroom mirror, shooting thick mixtures of cocaine and heroin into his neck.  His once beautifully conditioned and manicured hair had turned into a matted ball of lint exaggerated by his skeletal frame and highlighted by the purple track marks running down his jugular veins.  There were stragglers from up and down the road, who came in and out of my room day and night.  A 24-year-old guy we called Popeye stopped by frequently and bragged about kicking in doors and raping women.\\n\\nPopeye imagined booty lay on the other side of every window and door he saw, and nights he came around saw me trying to climb up the sides of buildings and into windows impossible to reach.    He jumped over the counter at Schlotzky’s and took a 20 out of the drawer one day and got away with it.  Popeye called me guero and liked to say I was stepping on his toes.\\n\\n\\nOne night I stole seven Ativan out of the bottle in Larry’s coat pocket while he slept in a pile of trash in the corner.  It had been a hard night for me as I was sick and mostly unable to sleep from a lack of heroin.  He sat up and patted his chest to feel for the bottles when he woke up at around 10 and pulled the bottles out.  11 pills had turned into four while he slept.  He looked at me.  I said, \\n“I’m sorry!”\\n\\nI made empty promises to repay him, but when he demanded proof, I ripped the microwave out of the wall and stuffed it into the red roll around suitcase.  It still had a laminated card from my grandmother’s travel agency and my own information from flying on it.\\n\\n“Call Luna!  Tell him to bring a dub!”\\n\\n“What?  You think he is going to want that nasty, little thing?  You’ve lost it.”\\n\\n“Just call him!  I’ll deal with him when he gets here!”\\n\\nLarry called him, and I could tell Luna was trying to confirm that we had money over the phone, but Larry danced around it until Luna agreed to come anyway.  I slid my arms into the sleeves of my NASCAR racing jacket and headed across the parking lot with Larry hobbling on crutches.  It was a number 24, Jeff Gordon racing jacket, bright red with blue flames up the sleeves and a bright blue DUPONT logo on the front.  My mom had ordered it for me brand new, to replace the old dirty one she made me throw away in California.  Larry’s crutches creaked in the cold across the asphalt.  The suitcase rolled behind me and half of the microwave stuck out.  The power chord dragged behind.\\n\\nIt had all unraveled.  \\n\\n\\nAs if the bright red racing jacket and microwave in my suitcase and the raggedy old man on crutches didn’t attract enough attention or make us easy to identify, the whole crew of that Schlotzky’s knew us by name.  They always let us wait for Luna in the store out of the cold and even gave us free drinks from the soda fountain.\\n\\nThe manager smiled at us and asked us how we were doing and walked back to the drive-up window.  It was not likely that Luna would accept the microwave and not likely that he would give us a ride to hock it for the measly five bucks it would fetch.  I jumped over the counter to hit the cash out button.  The drawer opened, and I took a couple 20-dollar bills.  An employee screamed at me.  \\n\\nI handed Larry a 20 and ran through the parking lot behind the Warren Inn.  Somehow, I knew to get rid of my red jacket and went to my room from the other side of the building to change my clothes.  The sunglasses, headphones, blue Dickies jacket and backwards Kangol cap were enough of a change that when the cops came into the building to look for me, they asked me if I had seen myself running by in a red jacket.\\n\\n“No, officer, I haven’t seen him.” I tried to walk down the road but it was too cold.\\n\\nI walked to the other building and knocked on the yeast ball’s door.  A few days before this I sold him 20 dollars of laundry detergent and watched him put it in his arm while I did the coke he bought.  He knew I ripped him off, but there was nowhere else to go now.  The cops were coming.  I knocked again, but there was no response.\\n\\nWhen I finally walked back to the room to meet the cops in the hallway, they smashed my face into the wall and handcuffed me.  They already had Larry in the back of a squad car with his crutches and the 20 that I gave him.  The cops told me they would let me go with a ticket if I could give them back the other 20, but Larry had warrants and was going to jail either way.  As bold as it was to jump over the counter and help myself to the money in the cash box, the cops only charged me petty larceny.\\n\\nSitting there in handcuffs, I wasn’t embarrassed by gawking onlookers or the slowing traffic.  At 19 that was who I was, a criminal junkie, and that is what criminal junkies did.  They got arrested at 10:30 on a Tuesday morning for being embarrassingly inept at crime and the whole world saw it.  The officers talked amongst themselves and said that they wouldn’t go into the room to look for the other 20 because of the filth and stench.\\n\\nLarry and I spent three days in jail and went to court on Friday.  I took my charges and told the judge I had only come for school.  It was a mystery to me how I ended up jumping over the counter at a restaurant and taking money out of the register.  He let me go with time served.  Cheo picked me up a week later and took me back to his hometown to clean up.\\n\n",

                                                                                                                                                                            Danielle PART 2\\nViolent and otherwise destructive behavior was a defense mechanism, necessary to maintain a life of ruthless drug addiction in the streets.  It was the unsurprising side effect of a cold and calloused heart, which had no room for things like sentimentality or love.  Those things make a person weak and vulnerable in a world where dogs eat dogs, and even mothers eat their children.  That may sound extreme, but that is how it was to me.  That is how I saw it.  If I would sell myself for drugs, plunge a blade into my stomach, steal my grandmother’s jewelry or subject myself to the harsh reality of the streets day in and day out, what would stop me from doing the same to you?  Nothing.\\n---------------\\nWe told everyone we were in love, but love was impossible for people like us.  What we really had were attempts to fill our lives’ emotional voids with each other and chemical imbalances in our brains that manifested themselves as romantic fantasy.  In a very short time we became very close.  Probably because we spent every second of every day together, and every day tried us.\\n-------------------\\nSomewhere in her head, I was half baby and half bunny like her beloved Bunny O’Reilly from childhood.  Her mom had inadvertently programmed her to love that name, and her father programmed her to love men that were no good to her, even though he was pretty good to her when I knew her.  I fit the bill.  Half bunny and half baby, she called me bubby when I was capable of compassion, but when I had heroin eyes and the hiccups she just called me Clyde.\\n----------------------\\n\\n“Hey Clyde!  How come you never call me Bonnie?”\\n\\n“Cuz your name ain’t Bonnie!”\\n\\n“So what?  A Clyde ain’t nothing without a Bonnie.  Just like you ain’t nothing without me.  You’re my Clyde.  I want to be your Bonnie.”\\n\\n“You are my Bonnie, baby!  But, that ain’t your name.  You know how I am.  It’s like you wanting me to speak Spanish to you.”\\n\\n“Yeah!  I want you to call me Bonnie, and I want you to speak Spanish to me!”\\n\\n“What am I supposed to do?  Have conversations with myself?  You can’t even understand it.  That’s weird.  Like calling you Bonnie.”\\n\\n“So what?  Call me Bonnie, Clyde!  Speak Spanish to me!  It’s sexy!”\\n\\n“Yeah right!  You’re name ain’t Bonnie, and you don’t speak Spanish!  Now, drop it!”\\n\\nThe trajectory and momentum of my life scared people before she came around, but now it was a 20-pound cannon ball ripping through the air about to smash anyone and anything that got in its way, even her.  Instead of one, now a couple of drug dealers wanted to kill me.  Most junkies wanted to beat me up, and at least one cop promised to send me to prison the next time she found me.  But, the real reason we left town was that the heroin was no good since Vanessa and Smokey got busted, and Danielle said she could make big bucks stripping in the City.\\n\\nEight miles north of town, heading to Colorado, a friend of ours called me up and asked if we could score for a kid who was new to town at the homeless shelter.  We came over.  The kid sniffled and his eyes watered when he yawned.  He was sick for sure, so we said we would pick up from Joe and be right back.  But we drove to the city after we scored from Joe.  Our friend called to tell us that we were disgusting pieces of trash, and he was right.   We departed in the grainy black and white of a 1930s movie house featuring Bela Lugosi as Dracula.  We were some mad scientist’s undead creatures fleeing to the hills from an angry mob of town folk with their pitchforks and torches.\\n\\nThat first week in the city is mostly a blur.  Somehow, we got a hold of some speed and slunk up and down the street in the Camry, suspicious as they get, at all hours of the morning, but the cops never bothered us for it.  At a 24-hour donut shop, we took the two dollars and 39 cents out of the tip jar.  It must have been early in the month when her SSI check came in, because we were in and out of adult novelty shops across the city buying all kinds of stuff and even had a hotel room.  We made connections with new dealers, and let some homeless guy videotape us having sex in a hotel room one night.  I stole a pair of stilettos for her, but there was something we had to take care of before she could start stripping.\\n\\nNot long before we left town I missed an injection and deposited the warm, dirt water of a rinse into the muscle of her forearm.  She was thin.  Her veins rolled a lot, and she moved around when I dug in her arm trying to register blood.  The miss turned into an abscess the size of a golf ball, so we took matters into our own hands in a hotel room.\\n\\nWe stole a pack of shaving razors, a bottle of hydrogen peroxide, some gauze and tape.  I broke the thin blade out of one of the shavers and snapped it in half.  In the poorly lit bathroom she stood in the tub, while I knelt on the floor outside of it.  Danielle shook, and her lips curled in distress.  With her right wrist in my left hand I looked at her and said with a smile,\\n\\n“Now baby, I know that I look like one, but I feel like I should tell you that I’m not actually a doctor.”\\n\\n“Shut up!  It’s not funny!  Now hurry up!”\\n\\nI pushed the sharp side of the blade into the thin, yellowed skin on the head of her abscess.  A snake of black blood and green puss slithered down her arm and thudded in clumps on the floor by the drain.  She recoiled, but I held her wrist and pulled her back.\\n\\n“Now, we have to squeeze it.”  I pinched her flesh on either side of the bleeding wound and squeezed it.  More blood and puss oozed out.  Her body shuddered, and she groaned curse words.  We were high on heroin, but it didn’t make much difference for her.  It was painful.  I poked a hole into the top of the bottle of peroxide and sprayed a jet of the fluid into her wound.  It fizzed and foamed on the blood.\\n\\n“Okay.  That should be good.”  We wrapped it in gauze and taped it up and went to sleep.\\n\\nThe next night we went up to The Bus Stop to get her job at the strip club back.  After 15 minutes of waiting in the car, she walked out fuming and cursing back at one of the bouncers, and he screamed from across the parking lot that she was a junkie whore.  They did not want her back with a bandage on her arm like that.  So we headed back home.\\n\\nI wasn’t afraid of the death threats there, because if there was anything I knew about back home, it was that no one’s word was worth much.  The people who wanted to kill me would have to find me first, and even if they did, they would have to deal with me when they did.  I’m not saying that they weren’t dangerous people.  They were, but what I am saying is that when it came down to it, so was I.\\n\\n30 minutes out of the city a blizzard blinded us, and snow covered the interstate.  The radio played.  The heater warmed the car.  She sat naked in the passenger seat, and my hand rested between her legs when the car spun off the road.  The car did a few 360s on the highway, before we slid down the embankment of the median.  In two minutes a cop came to help us, so she put on a jacket and rolled down the window.  He told us to get off the road once he helped us get back onto it.  We stopped at the rest stop a few miles up the highway and spent the night.\\n\\nWhen we woke up, it was light and the roads were safe.  I found the ten-dollar bag of heroin we lost under the seat the night before and split it with her.  It was the last of what we bought for a guy that sent us 100 dollars from home a few days before.  He thought we would bring him some back some heroin from the city,\\nbut now it was all gone.\\n\\n“What do you think, baby?  It’s a four-hour ride back home, and the dope’s no good there.”\\n\\n“I know, bubby.  I know.  Let’s go back to the city.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Danielle PART 1\\nThe scars on my neck belong to her. Two cigarette burns, perfectly round and white, sit two inches below my ears where Frankenstein’s creature had his bolts. I see them every time I shave, and they remind me of hard days with my girl.  Her name was Danielle, but I called her baby.\\n------------\\nIn the middle of our arguments we screamed in one another’s faces. Sometimes, I cleared my throat and hawked phlegm into her eyes, and she spat back into mine. We tried to blow each other away with the spray of verbal buckshot until there was nothing left of us. Ten minutes later we made love on the bed or the back seat of the Camry and found something or someone to rob. It was a game we played, and it was killing both of us.\\n--------------\\nThe first time I met her, her boyfriend lay on the floor of my apartment trembling and bleeding through his pants.  My drug dealers pulled him out of her Camry on the south side of town and stabbed him in the knee for trying to go around me and deal with them directly.  It didn’t work out for him, thus the crying and bleeding on my floor.\\n\\n“Hi.”\\n\\n“Hi.”\\n\\n“Are you Riley?”\\n\\n“Yes.  You must be Danielle.”\\n\\n“Sure am.”  She dropped his head to put her hand out.\\n\\n“Good to finally meet you.”  I smiled and pinched her fingers.\\n\\n\\nI was seeing a different girl at the time, a 19-year-old red head who liked to smoke her dope and tell me she was on her way over hours before she left her house, but that morning in my apartment, the look in Danielle’s eye told me it was only a matter of time before we got together.  Never mind Mike and the red head.\\n\\nDanielle and Mike used to come over every day before three to laugh at me for nodding out and looking like Teen Wolf.  She always tried to get alone with me, but we didn’t hook up until after Mike started beating her again and I spent two weeks locked up, promising myself and everyone else that I would never do heroin again.\\n\\nMike took the battery out of her car and held her against her will in a trailer on the Mesa while I sat in jail.  Then he passed out one afternoon after he put the battery back in, and she made her escape.  Half an hour later, I called her from the payphone outside of the jail, and our reign of terror began.\\n\\nI should tell you that this is the part of the story where you might want to stop reading.  On the next page or so, I’m going to sell a guy a bag of dirt for 40 dollars and turn his face into hamburger meat before I hold him hostage in his bedroom for the night.  My girlfriend will beg me to infect her with the Hepatitis C virus, and I will try.  A few pages after that, I will rob a dead man, so if you’re not with all that or don’t understand that we were in a bad way, this is a good time to stop reading.\\n\\nOne of the only three heroin dealers in town fronted us packages of dope, and we came back with the money every night.  He fronted us more, and we returned with more cash.  Then he gave us a half-ounce, but we never came back.  He offered anyone in town a 50-dollar bag for our whereabouts and left promises to murder me on her voicemail.  We ripped off other junkies.  They hated us.  We stole merchandise and food from businesses.  The owners and employees hated us.  Several cops in town knew that I was driving the Camry and that I had a girlfriend.  They hated us too, but we hated each other most of all.\\n\\nDanielle had a monthly prescription for 90 Colonopin and a SSI check.  Both were available on the first of the month, and we shot so much dope and took so many pills the first week of the month that our only friend quit hanging out with us.  When her orange pill bottle quit rattling and the check was spent, anxiety wrought havoc.  More than once she left me at the gas station and freezing at three in the morning while I was buying cigarettes and drove by a few times, screaming and giving me the finger for no reason.  Later in the night we would go to the ER looking for meds.\\n\\nHer Camry became our home.  We cleaned out the ashtray at the casino several times a day and listened to Depeche Mode and Seminole Wind by John Anderson.  Our diet consisted entirely of Wendy’s spicy chicken nuggets and Baja Blast.  She made me give her a shot of dope visibly mixed with my own blood to intentionally contract Hepatitis C.  That way I could no longer use contamination as an excuse for why I wouldn’t share a hit or a rinse with her.  One afternoon I pulled over on the side of the highway and proposed to her with her own wooden ring.  She said yes and we made out like two outlaws in love.\\n\\nA lot of guys liked her.  One of them lived in a nice apartment his parents paid for.  His name was Justin.  Now I forget what he said, but it made me mad.  Then he gave us 40 bucks to go score, so she and I split it between us and put dirt in his bag.  He called to complain, but we quit answering the phone.  Later that night, I decided we should sleep at his place, so I parked in his parking lot and told her,\\n\\n“Get all of our blankets and meet me at the front door, baby.”\\n\\nAs I walked through the cobblestone courtyard of the adobe apartment complex, I wondered how mad he was and thought of what I was about to do.  I fingered the baggie in my pocket.  At his front door breath billowed out of my mouth, and the raps of my knuckles on his door bit cold into my bones.  I put my hand back into my pocket and waited.  The television played on the other side of the door.  He opened it, but the chain only allowed a few inches.\\n\\n“Who is that?  Riley?  What do you want?  I ought to mess you up for selling me dirt!  Get out of here!” The interior light of his apartment poured out yellow through the crack in the door.  It looked warm and comfortable.\\n\\n“I know.  I know.  Listen.  I got something here, to make up for it.”  I moved my arm and hand in my pocket, to indicate it was in my pocket.  “Open up, so I can show you.”\\n\\n“Ok.”  The door closed momentarily while the chain latch came off.  The knob turned.  I grabbed it and lodged myself in the doorframe so he couldn’t close it.  “What are you doing?  You can’t stay here!  Why does she have blankets?  Dude, what the f***?  Seriously?”  A pile of blankets with Danielle’s legs bounced through the courtyard towards us.  I made sure she got in before I let him shut the door.\\n\\nShe threw the blankets on the shag rug in front of his TV.  He whined in the kitchen and flapped his arms, but we disregarded him until we had settled in and felt ready to address him.  His accusations were mostly accurate, except when he said we didn’t have any heroin.  We did, but not for him.\\n\\nAfter she and I situated things, I showed him the 20-dollar bag we had.  It was enough to shut him up, because we promised to share.  We told him we would split it three ways, but in the bathroom, she and I split it down the middle.  Afterwards, we rinsed the spoon and cotton filter a few more times, until all that was left was dirt and ash in the spoon.  Then we sucked it up and came out of the bathroom to give it to him.  He happily took the syringe full of dirty water and never accused us of anything until we hid ourselves in the bathroom again.\\n\\nDanielle had her pants down, and I sat on the toilet applying cortisone cream to a patch of eczema on her rear end and thigh.  She leaned over the sink.  The door was locked while I took care of my baby.\\n\\n“Open up.  I know you’re in there doing more!  Open up!  You pieces of s***!”  The door shook as he pounded.  “Open up!  Open the f***ing door!”  The door hit her in the head when he kicked it in.\\n\\n\\nMy hands ripped the cedar towel rack out of the wall, before I could think.  I beat him back out of the bathroom and side-to-side, across the living room with the wooden rod.  A symphony of rage blared out of me and into my opponent.  High notes of great satisfaction created melodies of glee as I continued to dominate.  I was the impassioned composer of a brutal work, wildly conducting an orchestra of fingers, fists and arms.  He tripped and fell backwards over his coffee table and couch.\\n\\nMy shirt was off and sweat was dripping when I threw the rod at his face.  He could have it, because I owned him now.  I leapt onto his chest for the crescendo of my opus and went to work.  I pinned his arms under my legs.  Bare knuckles bloodied themselves on his cheeks, and his face turned side to side with each punch.  Snot and blood leaked from his mouth and nose, and he squealed as I stopped to catch my breath.\\n\\n“Please, stop! Please! Please!” My teeth bit into my bottom lip.  I looked at him for a second with my fist cocked back, before I tried to drive it through the back of his skull.  His face was swollen and discolored and bloody.\\n\\n“That’s what you get for messing with my girl.”  I thought and jumped up to grab the biggest butcher knife in the kitchen.  About 10 inches of blade shined in the living room light.\\n\\n“I will f***ing kill you!  You piece of s***!  I will f***ing gut you!  You f***ing hear me?”  The F word constituted about one of every ten of my words back then!  “Get in your room and give me your cell phone!  You can come out in the morning, when she and I are done.  You hear me, you f***ing piece of s***?  Come out of the room, and I will stick this f***ing knife in your throat!  Your guts will be all over this f***ing floor!  You f***ing hear me?”\\n\\nHe didn’t say anything.  He gave me his phone and held his face as he walked into his room.  People around town always told me that he was a fighter.  Supposedly he stood up to Diablo once and even “gave him a run for his money.”  Everyone always said he was tough, but not that night.\\n\\nDanielle and I made a bed on the floor out of our blankets.  She pulled up some pornography on his phone.  Whatever meth we did the day before was too strong and the heroin was too weak to get us to sleep, so we had sex on and off throughout the night.  Sometimes, I smoked cigarettes and tried to write poetry on pieces of cardboard box.  She played dress up with some clothes that she had brought in.  Later in the night she said something that hurt my feelings, so I used the scissors in my hand to stab myself in the leg a few times, but as daylight broke there was forgiveness and more sex.  We defiled his toothbrush before we left, but I can’t remember why.\\n\n",

See him cower in the cold.  He is pale and thin and dressed in rags.  He sleeps on sidewalks and takes his meals from dumpsters.  His are the eyes that peer out from beneath city bridges at night.  His is the blood splattered on the bathroom walls.\\n----------\\nBehold, a savage lost.   \\n-----------------\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI spent a few hours laid over somewhere in the southwest and arrived at the airport late at night.  Roger and his girlfriend came from the city on the BART to pick me up and expected me to pay for the cab ride back to their hotel room.  The City mystified the boy who had only read about her in books and never lived anywhere but Louisiana.  This was where R. Crumb lived in the 60s and beautiful people had once worn flowers in their hair.  Jack Kerouac journeyed across the United States more than once to her and chronicled the adventures in On the Road.  This was where Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters held some of the first acid tests, and Andre Nickatina sold crack over his Blackberry cellphone.  The city held untold adventure in her streets, and I would discover it.  At the hotel I paid the driver, and we loaded my bags into their room.\\n\\n“Roger, when can you get some acid?  When can we trip?”  I lit a cigarette on the balcony of their hotel room.\\n\\n“Give me a light.”  He held his head down until he pulled smoke into his lungs.  He lifted his face to me and let the smoke out of his mouth and nose.  “I don’t know.  Maybe soon, but you need to get settled.  Tomorrow we’ll take you to the Red Cross to get your card and the hotel room.  We’re tired.”\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the morning we went and got things settled.  I put my 2300 dollars from FEMA in the Bank of America got a 300-dollar ATM card from the Red Cross and a room in a hotel next to one of our friends.  Pretty soon we would all move in together and grow weed, and I felt great hope and excitement about starting over and leaving behind the wreckage of Katrina.  I could reinvent myself and do amazing things, but when Roger and his girlfriend stayed in my room one night, we all took Xanax.  I journeyed to the Tenderloin to smoke crack and walked back to the room to steal 200 dollars from Roger’s girlfriend while she slept.\\n\\nMy legs hurt from walking up and down the hills, and when I got back to the room at seven, Roger woke up and entered the bathroom.  The clouds of steam and white noise came through the crack in the door, and his girlfriend looked frantically through her purse for her wallet.\\n\\n“Where’s my wallet?  Where is it?!?”\\n\\nI stood sweaty in the corner with my shoes on like someone who had been smoking crack all night, and she looked confused and then like she hit bingo and then like she smelled excrement.  She walked into the bathroom to tell Roger that I took her money.  I threw her empty wallet behind the nightstand, and when she came out I asked,\\n\\n“Oh, is this it?  What’s it doing here?”  She didn’t say anything when I handed it to her, and they left.  Roger banged on the door to wake me up in the dark a few hours later.\\n\\n“Dude!  You better give her that money back!”\\n\\n“Dog!  You know I got the money.  It’s in the bank.  I’ll go tomorrow morning when they open.  First thing, and I’ll give her 20 bucks extra.  I’m sorry, bro.  Xanax does me like that.  You know how I get.”\\n\\n“Yeah.  I know.  She’s mad.  So, Tomorrow?”\\n\\n“First thing.  I promise.  The banks aren’t open right now.  Tell her I’m sorry.”\\n\\nI was on my own.  They didn’t want to grow weed with me anymore.  They didn’t want to live with me either, and I couldn’t blame them.  I had no idea what to do with myself if not grow weed with them.\\n\\nRoger sold me a sheet of acid, and that put my bank account at something like 1300 dollars from the original 2300 after one week in California.   I slipped into the fog of a mind laced with acid and watched VH1 videos play all night.  Sheryl Crow’s “Good is Good” video played over and over, and there was a knock at the door by daylight.  I opened to discover the wiry frame of a man I had smoked crack with a few nights before, and we smoked a bunch.  I stole 40 bucks from him when he passed out to go smoke some more in the middle of the night before the banks opened, but when I came back he woke up.\\n\\n“I’m not leaving, till you get me my money!”\\n\\n“No problem.  I have money in the bank.  Just let me go get it.”  I left the room with my jacket, my skateboard, my passport, my phone and the promise to pay him back.  Everything else I owned was in that room, but when I found out that the banks were closed for Columbus Day, I knew I couldn’t pay him.  The only things I found in the room when I got back 12 hours later were the sheet of acid in the drawer and a streak of feces on my pillow case.  The Cambodian maid who cleaned my room chastised me for getting robbed and told me how she tried to stop the guy.  It hurt her to see me controlled by drugs, but that was life for me.  I never thought about it much.\\n\\nAfter that I smoked meth in my hotel room and went to sell the sheet of acid with one of the street people helping me get meth.  My accomplice sent me into the store to buy a Three Musketeers bar for him while he waited for the buyer in the parking lot, but when I came out he was gone.  The candy bar was no consolation to the loss of the acid.  My mouth was too dry from meth to eat it.  There was no milk, and I hated nougat besides.\\n\\nBack in my room, a man who dressed like the Terminator spoke dark poetry and injected the meth into my arm with a needle that he pulled out of his boot.  It was the first time I used it much and still had not learned how to shoot myself up.  I also didn’t know where to buy any, but the sociopath in black leather did.  Hits of quality crank hammered my mind into hamburger meat, and I lost it.\\n\\nThe hotel sat on a beach on the Florida coast in my delusion, and strange junkies and random speed freaks owned the room.  It was not mine anymore but theirs.  Large men with stubble, breasts, beautiful hair and acne laughed like donkeys neighing and passed meth pipes around the room.  I cowered in the corner, my mind feeble and fragmented.  Sometimes I would watch the activities in my room through the window standing barefoot in the cold.  The infancy of a new day would lay the first layers of its blue luminescence on everything.  I wondered if they would be kind enough to let me in out of the cold.\\n\\nI woke up to an old episode of cops flickering blue on the TV and muted in a cloud of bad breath and meth smoke a week after the man in black shot me up the first time.  The lampshades hung crooked off their posts with random articles of clothing to partially block the light.  The man in black leather and a couple of other people I didn’t recognize hung off the bed and chairs like wet dish towels.  Management kicked me out as soon as they saw me.\\n\\nThe Red Cross put me up in a hotel room in Chinatown, and I spent a week floating around with a pair of bolt cutters and a guy who couldn’t decide if his name was Chet or Chad.  He always insisted that he wasn’t my homeboy and that I ought to quit referring to him as such.\\n\\nOne day I came back to the hotel and found white silhouettes on the wall where the TV and dresser once sat against it. The phone had been ripped out of the wall, and the mattress was gone too.  Turned out, he wasn’t my homeboy after all.\\n\\nBack home friends and family told me the law was looking for me, so I disappeared into the streets.  I had been robbed for all I had three times in my first three weeks away from home, and I had nowhere to go in a strange city.\\n\\nReally being homeless for the first time in my life scared me.  A few hours after I first became homeless my father called me.  We hadn’t really talked since that day that we got into it at the clinic, and all he had heard of me was what my friends told him about me on the needle.  He told me that he, my sister and my mother had a head on collision on Thanksgiving Day heading to his mom’s house.  He said that they were in ambulances and that his arm hurt, my mom’s neck was broken and my sister had amnesia.  I got the phone call by Civic Center Plaza, and this man on roller skates wore a pair of sunglasses and denim short shorts and headphones.  He danced in a state of drug-induced euphoria.  My heart broke, and I felt such pain and fear.  I bawled right there in front of everyone, and the man on roller skates stopped to give me a puzzled look, as if to say, “These are the streets, man.  We don’t do that here.”\\n\\nI became a particle of dust floating in the dark below skyscraper monsters, and the city was an organism.  Streets called veins pumped us around the city like some sort of carcinogenic sludge the organism needed to excrete but couldn’t.  An unfriendly haze of pollution and mental illness sat on the city, and there was a cold rain that fell in icy sheets or a deafening drizzle.  My mind wilted in the rain.  I used my imagination to pass the time and pretended to be a frontiersman blazing trails through the treacherous mountains of the city.  Sometimes I stalked the hills around imaginary medieval villages like Grendel devouring sheep and giving children nightmares.\\n\\nDown at the open air insane asylum called the Tenderloin, an angry black guy held a pimply and bald headed, Philippine man by the neck against a wall and tried to pimp him out to passersby.  A 300-pound transsexual sat on a crate between two cars and serviced another man who smoked his crack pipe freely.  A block down one street was where we sat our backs to a chain link fence and injected our drugs.  Mexican fences bought two cans of instant coffee for five bucks, a large can of Crew hair product for three and tubes of toothpaste for one.  Men called out whatever drug they had for sale, and in the 24-hour Carl’s Jr. another transsexual used tweezers to pick at her eyebrow shaped scabs and looked intently into her pocket mirror.  I refused her offer to eat the squishy grapes rolling around in a dirty grocery bag.  Another man asked me what JFK was doing in the Tenderloin and laughed.  Men and women walked by spouting gibberish like radios scrolling through the dial.  Others waited in silence for Skynet to take over.\\n\\nAnother corner was about the same in terms of the open sale of drugs and insanity, and I learned to spend my days and nights fooling the front desks of the welfare hotels to get out of the rain.  Damp stairwells gave me a place to turn the crook of my arm into a pincushion privately as I taught myself to register blood.  Staph and schizophrenia crawled on the walls, and I sat in wonder that people lived in places like this before I realized that it would have been a step up from where I was in life.  Sooner or later hotel management would find me and scream at me in a foreign language until they pushed me out of the front gate and back into the elements.\\n\\nA certain societal imbalance marked all my dealings and time in the city.  It was a place where men’s consciences went unchecked by the presence of females, because they had long since cast off the standards of moral decency demanded by their mothers, sisters, daughter or what were now sure to be estranged wives.   Consider the things men do in prison and the old book, “The Lord of the Flies.”  The boys who survive the plane crash in the book worship an impaled boar’s head.  They separate into tribes, and  they burn the island, until they are found by rescuers hunting each other for sport.\\n\\nThere are certain advantages that come from such complete moral abandon, and it isn’t hard to figure out what a 19-year-old homeless dope fiend does to survive in that environment.  He does the kind of things that involve old men getting on their knees behind some back alley dumpster before they spit their dentures out and press their foreheads into the young man’s belly button.  Gagging and choking and slobbering.  I was no stranger to those things, and I lost a bit of myself every time.\\n\\n\\nOn another night a beautiful and slender Asian lady, maybe 25 years old and found me in the rain.  She wore a tight black dress and looked delicate and distressed.  I crouched with my back against the wall of her building’s front door entrance when our eyes met.  I desperately desired the touch of a woman after so much time in the City.  She was beautiful, and her eyes said it all so I stood up to kiss her by the door.\\n\\nI knew where I was and what that might mean about her and for me.  But I was so thirsty for the taste of a woman’s lips and hungry for soft skin.  Her perfume filled my nostrils.  As soon as we kissed I knew it wasn’t what I had hoped, but long hair between my fingers and her breasts in my hands sold me on the deal.\\n\\nInside of the apartment, her penis was a great disappointment, but we made the most of it.  In the morning she gave me a five-dollar bill and sent me back into the freezing rain.  It was about 10 o’clock, and I took shelter in a KFC where I bought some chicken and a biscuit.\\n\\n\\nAfter two months of hard living on the streets my dad came to visit and, we rented a car to drive down the coast.  We saw Cannery Row and ate at a restaurant where he talked to the waiter about getting an education in California.  He bought me a new skateboard, a Northface hiking bag and a Kangol cap.  It was weird to have him there and for him to watch me interact with the homeless junkies throughout the city.\\n\\nHe smoked weed with me by Golden Gate Park, and I threatened the life of a guy who had ripped me off some weeks before.  After that I tried to show my dad how to read the bus stop maps while we were stoned and how I got around the city as a homeless person.  He had money, and he didn’t want to take the bus so he called a cab that took us back to the room.  Sometimes marijuana will show you the way things really are, and the way things really were that night was too much for him.  He wanted to go home that night.  He wanted to get out of the nightmare that I was living in.  After 3 days of trying not to be too disappointed and making the most of it, he gave me 200 dollars and told me that he loved me before he took off in a cab to the airport.  \\n\\nAfter the visit and the never-ending bombardment of men who wanted sex from me, I wanted a regular friend and found it in a kid named Cody.  He was 33 years old, but I called him a kid, because he seemed like one. He came across me in the middle of the street, delirious from no sleep and struggling to skateboard.  It was 4 a.m., and he took me back to his squat where he gave me a shot of heroin and told me I could sleep on the couch.\\n\\nIt was odd inside of his room, like we crawled through a doorway in his eardrum and into his mind riddled with holes.  We went back in time to the era when punk turned into grunge in the ether of his room.  He was the same kid who had run away from home at 14 in black combat boots and the denim jacket with spikes and the sleeves cut off.  Even though he was 33 now, he saw himself the way he was in 1991.  The radio in his room would have played the newest Nirvana or Blind Melon, and any newspapers would have told of the Soviet Union’s collapse.\\n\\nAll that he could see he stole.  He filled up his garage-like room with useless electronics and other things he scavenged from doorsteps around the city.  He squawked every word he spoke and had purple track marks that ran up and down his arms and neck like the stitched seems of a stuffed drawstring doll.  His wood glued Mohawk matched the chain from his septum to his earlobe, and pinpricked pupils revealed his ravaged soul.  Preoccupation with heroin eclipsed everything else.  He didn’t seem to notice that his teeth were gone or that the last 15 years had passed.  I was 19, and I wanted to be just like him.\\n\\nWe did heroin every day and lots of it, so runny noses, diarrhea, anxiety and flu like symptoms followed Cody and me wherever we went.  That is until we fixed up.  We bombed down hills at night on our skateboards high on meth and heroin.  Hood ornaments from vandalized cars jangled and shined on the chains that hung from our waists.  We howled and barked like dogs at the people walking by and tore through traffic on wet streets in the fog.  Falling meant dying, and we pushed it harder every chance we got.  We hung off of the back bumpers of trucks heading up the hills like skiers on a lift and ripped back down the pavement.\\n\\nSometimes we would go sit on a bench, so he could play guitar and let his voice echo in the empty dark between buildings.  Zombie crack heads laughed at his singing and the sight of us.  We were invincible and intimidating as Vikings all night long but when the sun came up, we came down.  Then, our backs hurt and we rode the ferry to work, where we groaned through painful labor and regretted every moment of the night before.  In the evening, we rode the ferry back to the city with our noses running.  We got our fix and did it all over again.\\n\\nThe city was my mother, and I was her child, an infant birthed into heartlessness, formed in a rancid womb.  She had no milk for me to drink.  She had no love to give, because cold concrete and sidewalks cannot nurture you.  They can only make you hard.\\n\\nI knew another guy who lived on the third floor of the King George Hotel, and when Cody and the goons that lived in his squat had enough of me I would spend the night at the King George.  He was a witch and one of the guys who always tried to get me to have sex with him.  Once I crashed out for three days and nights after a runner, and the few times I woke up he passed burning incense over me and did incantations.  He told me that burning jasmine brought unity between people, but I didn’t believe him or care.\\n\\n“I’m a witch, you know that right?”  He asked me with a feminine and conceited wag of the head.\\n\\n“No.  Don’t you mean warlock, or something?  Aren’t witches women?”  I was pretty sure that women were witches, but he seemed feminine enough.  Who was I to say what he was anyway?  I didn’t know.\\n\\n“No.  I’m a witch.  See my altar?”  He pointed to a glass table on the side of his TV with large rocks and crystals, a mortar and pestle, odd figurines made of shiny metal and crumbling arrangements of earthy herbs.  He told me about how he cursed some woman for touching his altar against his wishes and how she was afraid of him after that.  “I got a picture of her head and put it in my mirror box, and then next time I saw her, she was terrified of me.”\\n\\nHe asked me to get him a 20-dollar bag of meth one night, which went wrong, and the whole incident reminds me of this joke.  Instead of keeping plans or being on time, meth addicts would rather spend the week trying to turn the toaster into a time machine and go back in time to keep their missed obligations.  We called our inability to keep appointments or distinguish 30 minutes from three days: tweeker time, and I was guilty of it as anyone.\\n\\nBut like I was saying, the witch wanted me to score for him, so I came over, left my stuff in his room and took off on my skateboard.  He seemed upset when I showed up three days later with a perfectly good excuse and 60 dollars’ worth to make up for it, and in front of the many pedestrians he screamed loudly about our deal and the drugs I had on me. I grabbed his collar and pulled his nose close until it touched mine, before I politely asked him to, “shut the f*** up!’\\n\\nHe broke free and ran up to his apartment.  I skated down the hill and found Cody who helped me sell a 20 out of the 60.  Then I did the rest of it and hid my mind in a cloud of murderous thoughts.  At some point I called him about the incident to tell him I would have the money in the morning, but he threatened to keep the things my father gave me on his visit and said he would never give them back.\\n\\nIt was eight o’clock when his hotel opened for visitors, and I checked in with management first thing.  On the third floor of the King George his door swung open with a touch of my finger to reveal him laid out on his bed and various bottles of malt liquor around the room.  I threw the 20 at his head and told him,\\n\\n“There is your 20 back.  I’m getting my stuff and I’m out.  See you later!”  He woke up.\\n\\n“What?  It’s my birthday!”  There was a hurt in his voice, probably from all the times that I turned him down for sex.\\n\\n“I’m getting my stuff and I’m out.  Your 20 is in your bed with you.”\\n\\nHe jumped to his feet and tried to stab me in the head with a brass letter opener, but I ducked, and he over swung.  It was too easy to beat him up after he had fallen backwards into my arms like that.\\n\\nI made a figure four with my legs around his torso and ratcheted it tight to squeeze the air out of him.  The hard bones in my wrists and forearms caught him at the gum under his lip and scraped up backwards into his nose and over his entire face.  Porcelain figurines crashed with the glass shelves by his TV and altar.  He turned right, and I beat him in the face with my right fist and forearm.  He turned left to get a beating that way too.  It was his mistake to try keeping the things my father bought me.  I thought I would kill him.  When he tried to call the police I took the cell phone from him and threw it out of the third story window.  He screamed, and the neighbors called the cops before I jumped off him and sat in the hallway waiting for the police.\\n\\n\\n\\nSoon after that Cody’s squat and everyone in it got evicted after years of the landlords trying to do it legally.  There was no place for me to stay so I bounced around town until I got a phone call one day.  I had just come from getting hassled by the police and spilling a cooker full of goofballs (meth and heroin mixed) on the side of a shopping cart in the Central Business District.  A cop said he got a call about us openly using needles on the sidewalk and that he was there to check it out.  My friend pulled out his syringe and showed the cop that he used it to suck the purple fluid out of the sores that covered his legs with a demonstration.  The cop’s chin and lips quivered, revolted by what he saw before he told us to take off, and I went to sit on a bench at Embarcadero.  That’s when my phone rang and showed a weird 505 area code.\\n\\n“Hello?”\\n\\n“Hay-low, Rah Lee?”\\n\\n“Yes.  This is Riley.  Who’s this?”\\n\\n“Cheo!  You mom’s fren.”\\n\\nCheo offered me a place to stay with him in New Mexico and get sober and maybe go to school.  I agreed to go.  Looking back I giggle a little bit.  He had no idea what he was getting into.  Fact is my personal problems were a bitter mouthful of dry grit he would struggle to chew, much less swallow.  A faceless voice to me then, he became one of my best friends, and other than my father and mother no one tried harder to get me sober and happy.\\n\\nOn December 26th my mom came with my little sister and her mother to get me off the streets, and I met them in the lobby of one of the ritzier hotels by Union Square.  They were happy to see me and seemed to think that I would look worse.  Cody and I kept doing heroin during the day, and my mom let him stay in the room with me while she stayed with my sister and her mom next door.  In the morning they took us to eat breakfast, and all three laughed at Cody as he nodded out and drooled at the table in front of his omelet, link sausages, bacon strips, hash browns with extra cheese and two scoops of chocolate covered ice cream melting on a short stack of pancakes.  My grandmother laughed hardest of all.  After that, my mom bought me all new gear, and I said good-bye to Cody and my mom at the airport and left to meet Cheo in New Mexico.\\n\\nHe met me at the airport in a green military cap and corduroy pants, before he took me to get a soggy burrito and put me up at a hotel for the night.  I spent the next several months in New Mexico covered from my feet to my belly button in a horrible rash of pocks that began where the witch bit my arm.  I swore that it was a curse he put on me.\\n\\nThat first night in New Mexico, a fevered heroin darkness played the background to my dreams.  A terrifying reality choked me and startled me awake in that hotel room.  There was no getting a fix to make the sickness go away. I would not get well, not this time.\\n\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     I wandered the streets eating out of trashcans while waiting to come up and get well for the day.  Sunday mornings always moved the slowest, because everyone went to church or slept in after working all week. When I called home desperate for money, This Sunday Morning always played on CBS in the background.  It was warm in my parent’s bedroom on the other side of the payphone receiver, but no matter how tightly I squeezed my eyes and imagined myself back home smelling biscuits and bacon or holding a cup of black coffee, my feet never disappeared with my heart and mind over the line.  They were two cold, wet bricks anchoring me to the miserable reality of life on the streets some 2000 miles away, hungry and sick.\\n\\nThe insides of my sweatshirt sleeves were covered in the crimson stains of old blood that ran down my arms while I tried to find a vein behind a back alley dumpster or in a department store bathroom.  My track marks looked like the lines of a rural highway system on a road map.  They were deep purple and all ran up my arms back towards my blackened, hardened heart slowly rotting from the inside out.\\n\\nIt seemed like there was always a spot on my body where things had gotten hairy in the middle of an injection and I missed the vein.  Sometimes they got infected, but they always hurt.  My friends had bandages or scabs on their necks and faces.  They all had suitcases they carried everywhere they went.  At lunch time, I could be found brazenly asking people dining at pizzerias for a slice, and if they pretended not to hear, I asked louder like they didn’t speak English.  When I laid down behind my dumpster, it would be hard to sleep, and I would get up and walk for hours back to the good ashtrays in town.  I knew where the ashtrays were, like I knew where the payphones were and can’t imagine I ever walked less than ten miles in a day. \\n\\nDealers and junkies on the street all knew me as a guy who got things for people.  It was gratifying to be sought after and known for being a criminal.  People asked me to get them certain clothes or electronic gear in exchange for heroin, and I obliged.  If there was nothing specific to get for a dealer, then I might sell as much as 2000 dollars’ worth of stolen merchandise for a 20-dollar bill to the African cabbies outside of the bus station.\\n\\nI pretended to be normal when I went into grocery stores to steal food like I had a car and a dog and a girlfriend and another pair of shoes in an apartment close by, and I would get into character using what I imagined was method acting.  The greatest way to project that I wasn’t homeless was to believe it as reality and become one of the customers coming in to get the missing ingredients for tonight’s dinner.  My girlfriend was back at the apartment with my dog.  The smells of yeast and flour in the bakery or bananas and watermelon in the fruit aisles helped me get into character despite my dingy clothes.  Those smells provided one of the only forms of stasis in a life where everything else changed and failed.\\n\\nA ring of thieves recruited me, and we rode busses around town to hit pharmacies for their allergy medicines and vitamins or Nicorette before we rode out to meet the fence.  The management at different pharmacies knew me and one other kid by name and referred to us as prolific shoplifters, which made us proud.  It was always a good night for us walking away from our efforts with 5 balloons apiece and each other’s company to feel like we belonged to something.  One night I hit the Fred Meyers off the yellow line by myself and got chased through the parking lot before I threatened to stab the men chasing me with my dirty syringe.\\n\\nIt got easier to navigate but rougher in other ways as I burnt bridges or became too well known for stealing at certain stores, and fall would be there soon enough.  It was already late June, so I made plans to go to some Christian rehab in Idaho over a dozen phone calls with my mother.  My cousin would graduate the weekend that I arrived, and my uncle would help me get situated until I got into the program.  She sent me 20 dollars a day in exchange for my promised cooperation, but things were tough anyway.  All the bike cops downtown wanted to arrest me and even knew me by name.  Well, almost knew me by name.\\n\\n“Mr. Champion is that you?”  It’s actually Chapman, but I knew what the bike officer meant.\\n\\n“Yes sir.” My friend, Johnny Johnson, and I had a 20-dollar piece of black halfway cooked up in the bottom of an old malt liquor can, and he was showing me how to use one of the big needles to hit the vein next to my femoral artery. We sat in the bushes beside a bridge.\\n\\n“Okay.  Why don’t you put that beer down and come see me with your friend?” The cop gave us tickets for drinking in public.  Once he left, we recovered the hit in the bottom of the can and did it.\\n\\nOn the 4th of July, I went to watch the fireworks on the Willamette and had a stolen and unopened package of pink high heel insoles in my pocket.  Their product number matched the number on a receipt I found in a trashcan by Pioneer Square, and after the fireworks I went to get the cash back for them.  For some reason the manager wanted my ID and wouldn’t do the exchange for me.  We screamed at each other and threw our hands in the air before I left.  It’s one of the last nights I remember, before I left.  \\n\\nI had promised my mother that I would cooperate and get on the bus to Idaho when the time came, but I tried to make them send me more money last minute and threatened to not get on the bus.\\n\\n“Listen to me, Riley!”  My mother spoke in a tone I had not heard much over the years.  “If you don’t get on that bus you can forget about calling me for anything.  Ever.  I’m done with you if you don’t get on that bus!  So do you what you want to!  It doesn’t matter to me!”  She hung up.\\n\\nIt was on a Friday morning, and on a previous phone call, I had threatened my father with becoming a freak that only talked about Jesus to make him doubt the decision to send me there.  He didn’t really care for religion, and I wanted to keep smoking cigarettes, which would not be allowed.  It wasn’t true though.  I would never believe in Jesus Christ.  As far as I was concerned the whole story was fake.  He was a fraud, and I hated him anyway.\\n\\nFor some reason, I got on the bus that morning and felt sad about leaving my place among the thieves and homeless addicts.  Rolling out of town the streets begged me to stay.  Where was I going?  What did Idaho have for me?  My family lived in the streets.  Even if we ripped each other off and didn’t have genes or parents in common we had our suffering to unify us, but now I was leaving.  \\n\\nI knew cross country bus rides well, and even though this one would only be seven hours, the familiar nostalgia of passing people’s entire lives and their heartaches and their joys and their childhoods and the farms where their daddy’s daddy grew up eight decades before flew by in a few seconds like it was nothing, like it didn’t even matter. So, the scenery changed in the windows like the shapes of a kaleidoscope or the two dimensional props of a play on stage being flipped up, flopped down and rolled away by some invisible crew all the way to Idaho where people ate potatoes I guessed.  The two guys seated together in front of me had been released from some mental/behavioral health facility somewhere in California and were on their ways home.  One of them kept craning his neck and muttering about onions and potatoes.  He asked the pretty girl across the aisle if she had a boyfriend.  She said yes, and he asked\\n\\n“How long have you had that problem?”\\n\\nMy uncle picked me up with my aunt and took me to eat before buying me some clothes at the Goodwill and dropping me off at the Motel 6 in Idaho with a fresh pack of cigarettes.  It was weird to see my cousin at church on Sunday praying at the altar with the other men in the program, and he prayed on stage before he gave his testimony.  He gave glory to Jesus, and talked about having a God shaped hole in his heart that only God could fill.  I knew then that he was brainwashed.\\n\\nThe next guy spoke in low toned uncertainty about living in his car through winter and drinking bottles of mouthwash.  When the last guy picked up the microphone he enthusiastically howled in joy.  The audience clapped and laughed and cheered him on.  His story was one of hopelessness and a broken family.  Both of his parents were addicted, and besides occasionally staying with his loving grandmother, he lived in detention centers or on the streets.  He told about how the police raided his friends’ tree house and that once he was old enough to go to prison, he went.  Whenever he got out, he went right back.  The love and family provided by the prison gangs and stability of the institutions were things he was comfortable with.  \\n\\nSome of his old friends went through the program years before and were successful.  They paid for him to go through the ranch, and when his judge let him out, the opportunity terrified him.  On stage, he said he had wanted to “beat on the door of the jail, until they let him back in.”  He talked for 20 minutes, and people in the audience wept openly over what he said.  Many of them had known him since he was a troubled teenager.\\n\n",

       Before I ever got lost at the Warren Inn and took my microwave hostage, I spent a month in the back bedroom at Cheo’s recuperating from my time on the streets.  I had a rash on my legs, which I mentioned before but I never explained how bad it got.  It was a curse from when I beat up that witch and he bit me.  At least that was what I supposed.\\n\\nPocking and a slight itch started at the hotel when my mom and sister and grandmother came to get me in the city.  I told you that, but by the time I got to New Mexico, the rash robbed me of sleep.  It tortured me.  It broke my already feeble mind.  My legs and ankles visibly swelled, and three different doctors had no answer.  What I determined to be a secondary staph infection created lesions on my thighs that broke and wept when I lifted anything heavy.  A round of sulfur based antibiotics gave me some relief, but even if the rash wasn’t there to plague my life, there were other things breaking me inside.\\n\\nThe abrupt discontinuation of my daily heroin regimen made me feel everything my body was doing.  My bones’ hard surfaces cut into my aching muscles, pulling and twisting every ligament.  Instead of a spine with vertebra, I had a stack of wooden Jenga blocks ready to fall.  My guts gurgled when I swallowed my saliva.  I imagined my brain’s synaptic firings discharged heat through my ears and caused a dull aching in my eyeballs.  It was as if life had become an electrically charged fence into which I was slowly being pushed. \\n\\nMy feet shuffled across the floor in the daytime.  Articles of clothing I collected from the streets covered Cheo’s back room in truly psychotic fashion.  I spilled rolling tobacco all over his house and crept around the kitchen at night.  His cupboard’s hinges creaked while his family slept.  Solidified chunks from an expired can of Ensure got stuck between my teeth.  I gagged.  It was my own fault for compulsively looting his dry goods cabinet and eating whatever I found in the dark. \\n  \\nAt four every afternoon, I reeled from the horrors I lived on the streets of the city, the belly of hell itself.  Cheo’s wife would talk to me about this or that, but it always ended up with her assuring me that I was okay, that I could recover.  It was like flipping through a book that you knew so well, but evil was written where there had been good.  Blank pages existed where maps of myself had once been drawn, and termites had turned the remaining pieces of parchment into confetti.  \\n\\nI held my head in my hands.  Who was I?  What had I done?  Something was wrong and worse than ever.  I never cried, but I probably should have.  These were the pains of metamorphosis, which I never could feel on the drugs, but when I was sober, the screams of my own childhood’s murdered innocence echoed inside of my skull. \\n \\nI thought about my father and the things I did to hurt him.  I thought about my mother and how she threw herself on the bed and cried when I got arrested at the house.  I thought about the failures with my girlfriend and how disgusting I was.  I registered for school and moved into the Warren Inn down in Santa Fe.       \\n\n",

                                                          I had a job valet parking cars at a hotel and went to work that next Saturday night as usual.  If I made enough money in tips while I was working, I would take off with one of the customer’s cars to score in the ghetto, but that night was not good for me.  My mom’s mom, Grand Mary, let me stay at her apartment 10 blocks away, because I didn’t have the LandCruiser to drive back to my place.\\n\\nIn the morning I woke up with my legs on the wall, and when she came to take the sheets off of the couch, she asked me if I wet the bed.\\n\\n“No.”\\n\\n“Then why is the sheet so wet?”\\n\\n“I’m sweating.”\\n\\n“Why are you sweating?”  She reached out to touch the moisture on my forehead.\\n\\n“I’m sick.”\\n\\n“Why are you sick?”\\n\\n“Um………… I’m sick for heroin.”\\n\\n“You’re on heroin?”\\n\\n“Yeah.  I’m on heroin.  I’m sick.”\\n\\n“Why did you get on heroin, again?”\\n\\n“I don’t really have a good answer for that, but I get sick, so I can’t really stop.”\\n\\n“Well, what are you going to do about that?  Isn’t there something you can do?”\\n\\n“Yes.  I’m supposed to be getting on methadone Tuesday morning.”\\n\\n“Why wait till Tuesday?”\\n\\n“That’s when they take people into the program.”\\n\\n“Hmm.  Well, how are you going to work?”\\n\\n“I don’t know.  I can’t get anything without money.”\\n\\n“How much money do you need?”\\n\\n“Bags go for 50.”\\n\\nMy grandmother went to get her wallet and took me in her Camry to the Conoco on Willow before she took me to work.  I was so high at work that I almost got fired.\\n\n",
       "34976     \\nRabies concentrates itself in the saliva and nervous system of its hosts, thereby, causing its host to infect others with the virus through biting.  Interestingly it seems to have an intelligent strategy in spreading itself from its hosts to others.  The facts associated with different kinds of super bugs, hemorrhagic fever and the disproportionate number of white women from the states of Texas and California having Morgellon’s disease fascinate me.  Recreational research of diseases can be fun, but first-hand experiences with them are not.  I have had Hepatitis C, multiple abscesses, one infected deep vein thrombosis, cellulitis in my arm and what may have been sarcoptic mange once, but the worst disease I ever had was my own self.  It was even worse than the time MRSA devoured my spine and that epidural abscess almost crushed it.\\n-------------\\n\\n\\nWhen Angie, Cade and I got off the bus, we scored 3 20-dollar balloons of heroin first thing from a guy outside of Powell’s bookstore.  It was Saturday night, and drunken college students littered the sidewalks outside of the bars in the night.  Cigarette smoke and slurred conversation filled the air and came from people who had no idea what life was like for my kind.  They would go back to their beds in their apartments after spending 100 dollars at the bar.  I would sleep on the cold concrete in one of the doorways down the street with my head inches from the puddles they would tromp their stylish leather shoes through on the way home.\\n\\nWe all split up, and I lost my piece of heroin in a Pita Pit bathroom.  The bars closed when I found Cade and tried to sleep on the pavement next to him.  Unlike the place we came from, we did not know the ins and outs of homelessness in this new place.  We had played like kids on a jungle gym in the city we lived in before but didn’t even know where to find cardboard to sleep on.\\n\\nAngie found us in the morning, and we got high one more time before we parted ways for good.  I lived at the Joyce while my parents paid the rent, because I promised them that I was taking every possible step to get into a place called Hooper detox.  Truthfully, I had never been there or even called, and I wasn’t taking any steps to get in.\\n\\nI paid 50 something dollars a night, but I told them it cost 80 and used the extra to buy heroin.  The dive from paying 20 bucks for 300 milligrams of morphine on pill hill in the Tenderloin to the 20-dollar mouse turds of mediocre heroine I bought from the guy on the 3rd floor of the Joyce was hard to stomach.  It never gave me what I wanted, and I was sick by 4 every morning.  I did a lot of rinses to pass the time and injected some ashy water in my forearm on afternoon.\\n\\nThat night I got cotton fever.  It started like always with sweaty chills and severe bone and muscle aches.  My head pounded and the shakes steadily grew with a kidney pain.  The shakes turned into jerking convulsions and lifted me off the bed like Linda Blair.  I puked on the floor and sheets.  My mouth and throat parched till my lips stuck together.  I cried for water.  I tried to drink and wretched it all back up a second later.  I puked and pooped in the common shower down the hall.  My head and kidneys hurt so bad I cried and puked some more.  I did not sleep.  “At least Ebola kills you.” I thought to myself as the sun came up.  CNN showed Gaddafi bloodied and beaten by his enemies.  He had been captured in Libya.\\n\\nMy parents sent the money for the day, and the dealer had to make change in his room after he gave me the 20-dollar balloon.  While I cooked up my hit, a pebbly slime rose in my chest, and I almost peed my pants.  I grabbed the small trashcan to pee into and puked into it simultaneously.  A large squirt of diarrhea ran down my leg, and it took a second to collect myself, before I did the shot.  My dealer met me in the hallway with the 60 dollars for rent on my way to the shower.  \\n\\nAfter the shower, I watched TV for a while and tried to relax.  When I went to pay rent at the front desk I realized that I had left the money in the bathroom.  It was gone, and I told management that I had to go pick up another Western Union at Safeway.  My dad yelled at me over the phone about having to send more money.\\n\\nI wore the only thing in my room that wasn’t plastered with excrement, a pair of pajama pants, completely ripped from the crotch and down the leg and no underwear.  It was cold and the 10 blocks back to Safeway were embarrassing while I tried to keep the thin, ripped fabric from exposing my private parts on the street.  I waited two hours for the money, but when I returned to the Joyce management kicked me out for finding a syringe under my bed and the smell coming out of the trashcan.  They seemed to think that I was defecating in it.  The front desk clerk, an inadequate type with thick rimmed glasses, a skinny neck and a buzz cut, told me about finding an overdosed body in one of the rooms last week and gave me a pair of jeans that were too small.  The pink and white frosting on my animal cookies provoked my guts to gurgling again while I listened.  Perhaps, the treat was a bit premature.    \\n\\n       For the next three mornings, I walked to the MAX in the dark and took the red line to the Rose Quarter.  Being new to town, I thought it seemed like an amazing place to live.  It was progressive and of a size somewhere between a town and a city.  It boasted one of the top public transit systems in the nation.  Everyone bought their milk and eggs from the farmer’s markets and rode retro fixed gear bikes with skinny tires and smoked weed.  However cool of a place it was to live, I still slept outside, and it would never be that cool for me.  \\n\\n       But at least I was finally fulfilling my promise to my parents about trying to get into the detox, and I slept in an asphalt parking lot with a jacket over my legs through the cold nights.  Hooper took me in on the third morning, but the day before that, my arm turned into a thick piece of oak firewood, hard and swollen and excruciating.  The ER at Good Samaritan Hospital told me it was cellulitis, and when I first got there the doctors and nurses sneered at the smell in the room.  Fish scales of hardened, dead skin covered the soles of my feet from the black and white Adidas I found and had worn for weeks without socks.\\n\\nThe medical detox at Hooper was easy for me, except that no amount of washing my feet helped.  It became an unsettling stench that started light, but the longer I sat in any one place, everyone had to ask, “What is that smell?  Whoah!  What is that?”  I watched movies, ate graham crackers and drank milk, until they gave out Trazodone at eight p.m.  After seven days I took my last two milligrams of buprenorphine and left three days later to a sober living facility called the 8x8.\\n\\nMen and women who had struggled with addiction or alcoholism lived in the tiny rooms of the 8x8.  Each room had a kitchenette and toilet.  The city paid our rent so long as we attended five meetings a week and stayed sober.  I lived on the sixth floor, and all but one girl on the floor had already relapsed.\\n\\nMy first two weeks there something in my spine hurt like I never hurt before, and I took 24 IB profens every six hours to sleep.  My stomach bled inside from the pills, and everyone said that I should go to the ER.  I refused to go but moaned and wailed loudly every night in the lobby of the 8x8.  The black lady who worked the front desk at night couldn’t stand it or me for that matter.  It was easily the worst pain of my entire life, and when my mom came to visit me on Thanksgiving Day, she said,\\n\\n“No one’s face looks like yours does, that doesn’t need to go to the hospital.”\\n\\nWe took a taxi to Good Samaritan to see what they said.  It was my idea that after the CT scan I would go smoke a cigarette, but they said,\\n\\n“You have infected discs in your back, and it looks like some vertebral osteomyelitis.  That’s infected bone.  We’ll get you up to a room as soon as we can and start a round of antibiotics now.  I was going to give you some dilaudid, but your mother says you’re a recovering addict, so we’ll stick with Percocet, ten milligrams every 6 hours.”\\n\\n“Um.  So, can I go smoke now?”\\n\\n“No.   I’m sorry.”\\n\\nI needed a cigarette.  Ten milligrams of Percocet every five minutes couldn’t touch my tolerance or the pain.  My back hurt, and I thought my mom should have minded her own business.\\n\\n“Well, Momma, you know what I think, right?”\\n\\n“No.  What do you think, Riley?”\\n\\n“F*** this s*** show is what the f*** I think!  Just a bunch of stupid mother***ers around here!”  I reminded myself of Buffalo, and the doctor shrugged before she walked out of the room.  “Mother f***er!”\\n\\n\\nOn the third floor of the hospital my mom brought me Thai food and several bottles of IB profen, but it wasn’t long before the doctors discovered the IB profen and took it from me.  They said 4800 milligrams every six hours was not good for me, even if it was the only thing that worked.  Later that night I chased my mom out of the room, slammed the door and threw my dinner tray on the floor, so the doctors wrote me an order for three milligrams of liquid morphine.  It didn’t work, and they seemed surprised that I wasn’t more thankful.\\n\\nThe next afternoon I got an EKG to see if I had vegetative growths on my heart valves, otherwise known as endocarditis.  If I did, things were worse than I could imagine, but while the tech and his helper ran a piece of cold metal through the slime on my chest, one of my friends from the 8x8 showed up with some heroine.  I demanded to use the bathroom, and after a minute I pulled my friend into the bathroom in front of the technicians and locked the door.  We took 15 minutes to fix, so the nurse knocked and made me, “COME OUT OF THERE, NOW!”\\n\\nAt one a.m. a few days later my legs tingled and quit working so well.  I couldn’t use the bathroom, so a middle aged blonde woman came in and gave me a catheter.  The night doctor ordered another MRI.  I could not even move my feet an inch by the time they rolled me down the hall.  My blood pressure skyrocketed, and in the morning my regular doctors came to see me.  The Asian one asked me if I thought four milligrams of dilaudid would be enough, or if I wanted more.  To make my point about not drug seeking I asked for two milligrams, and I cried.\\n\\nI told the anesthesiologist in the OR,\\n\\n“I’ve never had surgery before.”\\n\\n“Well, you’ll be fine, sweetie.  Can you count from 100 backwards for me?”\\n\\n“100……99…….98……97….96…95…….”\\n\\nI woke up to feel the warmth of the fentanyl evaporating and sweaty desperation forming on my brow.  There were new pains in my back from where the surgeon laid open the meat and used power tools to cut into my vertebra and sowed a seam of fishing line through the skin over my spine.  A pretty x-ray tech slid a cold metal case behind me shortly after I woke up, and I screamed.  Different nurses brought me dilaudid and morphine every few hours.  After five days of sleepy agony, I slid out of bed and used my walker and arms to get my first shower with my mom’s help.\\nBefore I left a lady used a sonogram to run a thin rubber tube through a vein in my arm into my heart called a PICC line.  It was painless, and I was never supposed to mess with it for fear of infection or affecting my heart.  A mesh band held the capped nozzle against the skin of my upper arm, and a week after the surgery my mother helped move me into an assisted living facility.  \\n\\nI shuffled with my walker everywhere I went.\\n\\nIt took me fifteen days before I could walk unassisted, and my own toes only tripped me up occasionally.  23 days after surgery I had my first bowel movement and had not gone for several days before that.  The resident doctor at the retirement home stopped in to see me.\\n\\n\\n“How are you doing?”\\n“Good.  What happened to your arm, Doc?”\\n\\n“I had a skiing accident.  It’s okay though.  I’ll be out of this sling in a few weeks.  How are you doing coming off of the dilaudid?  When was your last dose?  Let’s see…..”\\n\\n“Um.  I think yesterday morning.  I think I feel okay.  You know?  I mean the doctor at the hospital told me that a lot of people think child birth or kidney stones are the most painful things a person can go through, but she said that’s because epidural abscesses are so rare.”\\n\\n“Yeah.  That’s for sure.  I can’t imagine what that’s like, but you say you feel okay for now without the dilaudid?”\\n\\n“Yeah, Doc.  I’m feeling okay.”\\n\\n“Good.  Well I’m going to get a drug test from you.  Let the nurse know when you are ready to pee.”\\n\\nThe surprise of a drug test made me paranoid, so I saved a bottle of pee in a bottle in case they ever gave me another one.  It was more boring and comfortable in the retirement home than the streets, but it was as sad.  The eerie stink and dread of leather skinned shadows leaked into the hallway while they waited for death in their rooms.  Sometimes I caught glimpses of straight faced families staring at the floor and sitting around the grey skeleton of their grandfather in bed, his mouth open, his eyes absent, a tangle of tubes and wires running from him to softly beeping machines.  The swollen-eyed nurses lost two or three patients a week.\\n\\nThe retirement home wanted to send me home after six weeks of antibiotics, but I wasn’t ready to give up my PICC line or hospital bed or cable TV or the morphine, so I demanded that they send me back to Good Samaritan for an MRI.  The results showed that my spine had only deteriorated since I arrived at the facility, and the doctor wrote me orders for six mg of dilaudid every four hours and upped my morphine besides adding Ativan, as needed.\\n\\nAn old, orange lady who I called Garfield and a young African immigrant took care of my meds, and I kept them under my tongue until I got back to my room, where I administered them to myself through my PICC line.  Whenever I took a shower I used a plastic card to try scraping the crocodile skin on the bottoms of my feet, and at night I snuck out of my window and walked down to a trailer park to buy meth or heroine.\\n\\nMy nurses all knew I was high but couldn’t figure out how I got it, and the administrators gave me a drug test when the maid found blackened spoons in my bathroom. When they gave me the cup, I used the old urine I saved from before.  One of the administrators came to see me the next day.\\n\\n“So, Mr. Chapman, when those results come back from the lab, you’ll be out of here.”  Her tone conveyed disgust and rejoicing at the prospect of my expulsion.  I was on my second round of antibiotics after the first ones didn’t work.\\n\\n“Okay.  Well, aren’t you sending it to a lab?”\\n\\n“Yes.”\\n\\n“So, you’ll know what’s in my system, right?  You’ll be able to know if it was heroin or morphine, right?”\\n\\n“Exactly. We’ll know you were doing heroin and you’ll be gone.”\\n\\n“No.  I won’t.”\\n\\n“Yes, you will, and then you’ll probably die of the infection.  Do you have anything to say for yourself, after throwing away your life like this?”\\n\\n“Yeah, I do.  Get the f*** out of my room and leave me the f*** alone until you have those results!  I’m watching cartoons!”\\n\\nShe didn’t have a response, but she left.  I got caught smoking cigarettes in my room at night by one of the nursing assistants, but got away with it.  Joints were harder to smoke, but I smoked them in the room too.  They knew I used my PICC line to inject my painkillers, because it ballooned out where I clogged it and had to be replaced.  All but one of the nurses hated my guts and wanted to get rid of me.  The one who didn’t hate me spent extra time in my room watching Comedy Central Roasts and went to the store to buy me every flavor of Laffy Taffy.  She talked to me about sex with her boyfriend and how he didn’t love her like she loved him.  Other nurses would make up reasons to come into the room and check my charts or IV pump when she lingered awkwardly talking to me.      \\n\\nBack home my family expected me to die, so my father visited to boost my spirits and maybe spend some of our last time together.  I didn’t know that’s what they thought, but my father had concluded from everything he heard that I would be lucky to live.  We watched my new favorite movie Drive with Ryan Gosling and Brian Cranston when he came, and he brought a king cake for the nurses.  At Buffalo Wild Wings we split a six piece of wings and an appetizer of spinach dip, which was different.  I always ate a lot of food and quickly, but the regimen of dilaudid and morphine and the hospital bed suppressed my appetite.  My stomach had shrunk so that I could barely eat, and he attributed my lethargy and lightheadedness to anemia.  He made me get my haircut and beard shaved off.  When I got back to the home, an older nurse said, “Boy!  You got me all turned on, and I’m black!”      \\n\\nOver the phone he told me what tests to make the doctors run and what numbers were good or acceptable and what was bad.  We watched the numbers of my erythrocyte sedimentation rate closest and felt relieved when it went down.  He saved my life for the umpteenth time, and after three months they let me go with an envelope of 12 dilaudid and a few prescriptions to be filled in New Orleans.\\n\\nI gave the nurses one last headache when I snuck out of the facility with my PICC line in.  One nurse wanted to take it out, but I told her the next nurse on shift would.  When the next nurse came on I told her the one before had already taken it out, and I left in a hurry.  The muscles burned in my atrophied body, and I wheezed all the way to the bus stop.  If there was ever an appropriate time to refrain from smoking cigarettes this was it, but I smoked at least three Camel 99s before I made it four blocks to the bus stop.  In the airport bathroom, I mixed up 24 milligrams of dilaudid and pushed it down my PICC line, but my body only tingled for a second.  Then I felt like nothing but sober.  \\n\\nBetween flights my dad called me,\\n\\n“Seems they have a big brouhaha over at the old folks’ home you were living in.”\\n\\n“Really?  How do you know that?”\\n\\n“Well, they called us, pretty frantic.  Did you get out of there with your PICC line in?”\\n\\n“Yeah.  I still have it in.”\\n\\n“S***!  Riley!”\\n\\n“It’s okay.  I’ll take it out myself.”\\n\\n“I don’t know about that.  I think that’s dangerous.  Let’s figure it out when you get here.”\\n\\n“Okay.  Sounds good.  We’re about to take off.”  I walked to the aircraft’s bathroom, and it moved in my heart and through my chest as I pulled two feet of thin tubing out of my arm.  It was probably a biohazard, and I thought about that before disposing of it in the waste bin.\\n\\n\\nMy luggage got lost on the plane, but a man delivered it all by three a.m.  There were a few morphine pills in my bags, so I took them as soon as they showed up.  In the morning my mom took me to get my dilaudid prescription filled, but since it was from Oregon they would only fill the morphine and Ativan, no dilaudid.  I refused to get the morphine filled as some sort of self-destructive protest but insisted on the Ativan.  An old roach from one of my parents’ parties gave me a head change, before my sisters took me to eat lunch at Frankie and Johnny’s.  \\n\\nMy sisters kept looking down and putting their hands over their eyes when I talked to the waitress.  They said, “Come on, Riley!  Stop!”\\nThey found my attitude and tone appalling.  The younger one laughed at the effects of marijuana on my eyes mixed with the onset of severe opiate withdrawals on my body, slowly turning into a broken slinky.  At the house, my sisters tried to watch Bridesmaids with me, but I passed out during the part where they got food poisoning.\\n\\nI woke up in the bed on the third floor, but I thought I must have showered with my clothes on and got right into bed at some point in the night and forgot about it.  My sheets were dripping wet.  I dreamed of swimming.  Streaks of brown clay lined the white tile in the bathroom by the toilet, but I didn’t remember getting up before then.  I snuck downstairs and stole 14 dollars out of my mom’s purse and her car keys.  I guzzled half a bottle of red cough syrup even though I knew it wouldn’t do anything for me.\\n\\nAt a Chevron, the crack head riding with me jumped out to see if she could get me some brown for 14 bucks.  The guys in the car had some but they wanted 40 dollars.  She told me to drive to a few other places in Pigeon town and jumped out to check inside of different houses.  I swerved to one last house, and while she was in the house my guts shook.  My sphincter quivered.  An untied leather boot turned itself around inside of me and tried to push itself through my throat before I puked up bile and red cough syrup, all over the interior of my mother’s Mercedes Benz.  I opened the door and slid out of the vehicle into the street to pull down my pants.  An aerosol of thin liquid sprayed the pavement and the backs of my shoes.  A trickle ran down my legs, and my vomit gushed onto the pavement in the middle of the ghetto before the sun came up.  This went on for a few minutes before I gave up on the woman coming back and left.  She could have the 14 bucks.  \\n\\nI continued to vomit on myself and didn’t even try to keep my bowels under control on the drive home.  “I’m going to die.  I’m going to die.”  I repeated to myself between retching and the expulsion of bile from my mouth and warm liquid spreading across the seat of my pants.\\n\\nMy father met me at the front door.  He knew I stole the car and some money, but most of all he knew I was going to die from this sickness if I didn’t get to the hospital.  My mother drove, and my father sat with me in the back seat.  They wheeled me to the ER where I talked the doctor into giving me some water.  My dad told her not to give me water, and I puked it up like he said I would.  Soon I was on the gurney in convulsions, in and out of consciousness.\\n\\n“I’m about to s***!”  I managed to gurgle to my dad and the orderly through the vomit.  The orderly and my dad hooked the back of my knees with their arms and pulled me up to slide the bedpan under me.\\nA doctor came in and belittled me for letting them put me on so much medicine in Portland.  I would have cursed him out, but it was too hard to talk and puke and convulse at the same time.  He wrote an order for some dilaudid to abate the vomiting and diarrhea until I could get enough fluids to not die.  I had only been home for 36 hours, but I had already stolen my mom’s car, 14 bucks from her purse, drank a half bottle of cough syrup, puked it up all over the interior of her Mercedes Benz, soiled the seats, tried to score drugs in the ghetto and was currently puking and pooping to death on a gurney at seven in the morning.  This was exactly why I had not been home for the last three years.\\n\\nThey let me out before I ever had a solid stool, which my dad said was wrong, and the following week I went to visit my father’s mother, Turkey.  I got a hold of some 30 milligram Oxy and needed money, so I set up a visit with Turkey.  He took me to eat at Popeye’s.  It had been over three years since I had seen him.  His bottom eyelids hung loose from his eyeballs, and he used a cane.  He was much older than I had ever known him to be.  I asked him for money, and he asked me why I needed it.  We both knew I was lying, but he gave me a few bucks before he left.\\n\\nMy parents could only have me home for a few weeks before they insisted that I enter a yearlong rehab called Bridge House.  It was free and boasted an extremely high success rate among its graduates.  I told my parents that I wasn’t using, even though I would disappear for hours and get caught lying about where I was.  My sister caught me bouncing (falling asleep and waking up 40-50 times a minute, while standing) one night, and I shared a needle at one of the gas stations with a random.  Seals and Croft played on the radio, and beads of sweat rolled down my cheeks.   Summer breeze makes me feel fine, blowing through the jasmine in my mind.  \\n\\nI knew I contracted HIV from it and went into Bridge House a few days later.  In one week I smoked my carton of Camel filters and got caught up in some commotion involving a guy called Long Beach threatening to stab another client with a pair of scissors.  We took off together.  A few days later my mom bought me a ticket back to Portland.  I don’t know what they thought I would do there, but at least I would be far away.\\n\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I stayed awake on meth for 3 days and nights once and called my parents from the apartment..  There was no reason that I can remember calling, but that phone call change my life.  My father’s father died of pneumonia when I was 11 years old.  His mind deteriorated from Alzheimer’s first, and then he couldn’t walk.  Too much time in bed lead to bed sores and after something like 7 years of not knowing where he was pneumonia developed.  My sisters and I knew my father had aged and seemed different than he had been our whole lives.  He never gave us a straight answer, and my mom denied anything was happening.\\n\\n“Momma, what’s wrong with Poppa?”\\n\\n“Hmmmmm….. What do you mean?”\\n\\n“You know what I mean.  He’s different.  Does he have Alzheimer’s?”  The background noise of indiscriminate words and voices on the TV came over the line in her silence.  She thought for a moment more, before she responded,\\n\\n“I’ll let you ask him yourself.  Let me get him.”  A few moments later I heard her say, “Kelly.  It’s Riley.  He wants to ask you something.”\\n\\n“Riley?  How are you?”  The kindness in his voice proved to me that something was different with him.  For years both of them always sounded so disappointed with me, and there was no reason why they wouldn’t be now.  He spoke softer and sweeter, like he didn’t remember the trouble I always caused them or maybe didn’t care anymore.  My insides braced for what I was about to hear.\\n\\n“Good.”  I choked, and my eyes twitched.\\n\\n“What’s up?”\\n\\n“Poppa, what’s wrong with you?”  There was no easy way to ask the question.\\n\\nHe laughed like he always did when things got serious or emotional.  “How can you tell something’s wrong?”\\n\\n“I just can.  You’re not the same.  What is it?”\\n\\n“I have had Parkinson’s disease for a few years now.”  The words broke me in half.  For more than a decade I tried to kill him by killing myself and had finally achieved success, but now that I finally had everything I thought I ever wanted, I didn’t want it anymore.  He couldn’t hear me cry because the wind was knocked out of me, and I didn’t know what to do, so I did drugs for the next few weeks trying to make it go away.\\n\\nBefore I turned the lights off and went to bed 2 weeks later, I threw my ranch bible off my bed and onto the floor.  It was too much for me to believe even if I wanted to.  Creation.  A flood.  Parting the Red Sea.  Fire and brimstone. The dead coming back to life. The resurrection and all the rest of it. “If God wanted me to believe the bible,” I thought, “Then, why did he make it a f***ing story book?” Those were the exact words in my head as I pushed the ember of my cigarette butt straight down into the ashtray and twisted. I pulled the chain on my reading lamp and fell back onto the bed, pulling the covers over my shoulder.  Christ wasn’t real, and he sure couldn’t save me.\\n\\nI struggled to sleep for those weeks and woke up in the middle of the night thinking that I was being stabbed to death a few hours after I threw my bible onto the floor.  The bible was too much to believe, but my desperation overrode my disillusioned disposition long enough for me to pick it up off the floor.  I turned to psalms to comfort me in place of the chemicals my brain and body were accustomed to, because the psalms were short, easy passages.  I read psalm 120.  Verse six says, My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace, and I thought to myself that it sounded appropriate for my life of running with the devil and hurting everyone.\\n\\nI moved onto the next psalm, and the first verse of it completed a high voltage circuit inside of my head and heart.  It was instantly clear to me that my life had been supernaturally saved by an almighty and all wise God.  As surely as I breathe and write this, more certainly than my name is Riley Chapman I know that I received eternal life and salvation.  The power and life and the miracle that took place inside of me dwarfed the supernatural acts I so doubted in the bible.  The waters of the Red Sea parting and turning water to wine and even creation itself could not compare to the glory at work inside of my chest and head.  God wrote those scriptures for me and to save me, before time ever was and waited an eternity for me to find them. He called my name, and that was it.  It was finished.\\n\\nNow the next morning there was only one thing crazier than the fact that Jesus Christ was the Lord of creation, and that he paid for my life of hostility towards him with his own death and that his life was now being lived in me.  The only thing crazier than all that the day after I got saved was myself.  My apartment on Foster continued to stink, and different dealers or alcoholics or junkies stopped by every day to see me or my roommate.  I smoked as many cigarettes as I could every day and all my clothes smelled like the fryer grease at the burger joint until I quit because of the drugs people did at work.\\n\\nI hung out with Faith every day after that.  She inspired me to live a life of holiness by her own steadfast devotion to God and the word.  She showed me what life in him could look like, and that it was cool and fun.  We lived a few blocks away from each other and spent our days listening to music or at the park with her dog.\\n\\nEveryone always said that we were a good fit for each other, but attraction did not exist between us.  She was my friend, and I was hers.  We spent all our time together.  We worked out together.  We ate together.  I even washed dishes at the Greek restaurant where she served tables, and our Greek boss commented that I would make a baby come out of her one day.  It wasn’t what I wanted, but I prayed to God that if it was his will then he would have to turn my heart towards her.\\n\\nI tried to quit smoking 8 times before I succeeded while Faith started smoking for the first time in 3 years.  There were roommates coming and going at the apartment doing drugs or drinking, and my mom still paid the rent for some reason.  She could tell something changed in me and felt happy to help since I was doing so well.  Faith loved working at the ranch and ministering to the women there, but she lost her job over the cigarettes that she started smoking with me.\\n\\n\\nJuly of 2013 became the first month of my life without cigarettes, marijuana or any drugs.  It was hard to believe that my life changed like that, and that it was so easy.  The chains of drug addiction and violence had me bound for over a decade by then, and on my birthday a leader in the Church publicly exhorted me for the obvious change in my life at a Friday night potluck.  I wept for God’s grace on my life at 27 years old.  \\n\\nIn August I moved out of the apartment on Foster and moved into a discipleship house several blocks away.  It was fall by then, and they found the dead body of one of Faith’s best friends.  He graduated the ranch, and Faith knew him for years before and after she came to Christ so her testimony was paramount in his decision to go through the program.  The untimely and self-inflicted death of a close friend hurts, especially if you were supposed to be with him the moment he did his last injection and died cold and alone by the river.\\n\\nFaith forgot to call him when she went to Monday night service.  They were supposed to go together, and besides that she blamed herself for smoking cigarettes and not being the shining testimony he expected her to be when he got out of the ranch even though he never blamed her.\\n\\nUnexpected emotion came over me at our friend’s house as she wept and slept wrapped in a blanket next to me on the couch.  There was an overwhelming desire to take care of her, to protect her, and I felt like I loved her as something more than a friend for the first time.  I wanted to wipe away her tears.  I wanted to hold her.\\n\\nI first confessed it to her over lunch at a Mexican restaurant with our friend.  She wouldn’t look up from her plate and shook her head after she told me to stop.  It was right after she told us that she was moving to Spokane for beauty school in an attempt to deal with our friend’s death.  I knew she would fight me, but I knew she needed me even though she never admitted it and said she didn’t want me.  No one knew her like me.  No one loved her like me.\\n\\nMy parents paid for me to fly home about 6 months after I got saved.  It was at Christmas time, and my mother’s whole family went to eat at Clancy’s.  Our grandmother and her boyfriend sat at the head of the big table by me, and I pretended to understand what the deaf old man was talking about. I had no idea.  Right before the main course was served up, I turned my chair away from them. I hadn’t thought much of it for the last 8 years, but I had been gone and lost and dead in so many ways. Here I was after all of it like I never left, and no one seemed to notice the significance of it. I turned my chair and wept like a man wrongly imprisoned and finally returned to his family. It wasn’t wrongful, but it was a prison inside of my mind and inside of myself like that. Now I was free, and all I could do was weep for the mercy and grace upon my life.\\n\\n\n",

                     I had a room in an apartment and kept it pitch black all day and night.  My bare mattress sat against the wall.  Trash and old food stunk, scattered across the floor.  A heavy comforter hung from the curtain rods, and in the corner a reading lamp sat on top of an unplugged TV.  It was the only light in the room and focused on the only things that mattered to me: a spoon, a syringe, a lighter and some empty baggies on top of the TV.  Cigarettes and hot spoons melted the top of the TV while I dug around in my forearm searching for a vein.  Sometimes I sprayed the bloody water on the walls.\\n\\nMy room matched my head, rotting trash strewn everywhere, curtains stained with bodily fluids, stink and neglect.  It was full of a black sickness and wherever I went, I painted everything the same color.  Things could be going well, but it would not be long till I turned my life into a mushroom cloud and everything around me into rubble.  Once again, those who loved me would be left to shield their eyes from the shockwave of dust, brains and shrapnel that would otherwise hit them in the face.\\n\\nI loved to make a mess.\\n\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     When I was little, they called me pig.  Not a pig.  Not the pig.  But pig.  And, so I was.  Fat.  Selfish.  Nasty.  Whether I became those things because of what they called me, or they called me pig because of the way I was, I don’t know, but I do know he is who I became.  Over the years I would try to kill him, in different ways.\\n------------------------------\\nMy dad came to get me out of a crack house at 6 on a Monday morning, because I had not been home since I left a week before to take the last exam of senior year.  He knew I had his bike, and my girlfriend told them where I was.  That week, she and I made out on the red brick steps of her mom’s front porch.  I smoked a Marlboro light and told her I had some heroin.  She pressed her lips together and opened her eyes big, as if to say, “Okay?  What do you want me to say about that?  That is scary.”\\n\\nThe rest of the time I spent at Alex’s while my girlfriend finished junior year.  I couldn’t believe it the first time the sun rose on Alex and me that week.  Only minutes passed since we started doing lines of cocaine and heroin, partying in his basement apartment the night before, but then the sun rose through the window.  Powders in my nose and smoke in my lungs turned on biochemical faucets in my head.  My body buzzed and skin tingled with euphoria.  We looked at each other in surprise and laughed in the warm light coming through the window.  The night was gone, and we would never get it back.  Now the week was gone.  Years later Alex died of an overdose. Then his life was gone, and he never got it back.\\n\\nBefore I woke up that Monday morning I recognized my father’s voice coming from the door.  It was steady, like he collected himself and repressed his panic a moment before he knocked.  He came to take me back home.  The drugs I smoked and snorted the night before still swirled bliss in the black behind my eyelids.  A hand touched my shoulder.  The urgent whispers of a figure in the dark startled me awake.  Where was I?\\n\\n“Riley.  Riley.  Wake up.  Your dad is here.  You have to go.”\\n\\n\\nMy father grabbed his bike and loaded it into the Landcruiser, so I told Alex,\\n\\n“Turn on the light.  I have to find my heroin.  I had 5 foils last night.”  The filament burned my retinas, and my brain shuddered before my hands shielded my eyes.\\n\\n“Are you sure?  I don’t remember that.  Where is it?”\\n\\nI searched my pockets and found a tin foil bindle of white powder cocaine, but I wanted my heroine.\\n\\n“I don’t know.  Let me check the couch.  I know I had them smoking crack with Cole last night.”  We pulled up the cushions and found nothing.  Then my father stood at the door.  The engine of his 1983 land cruiser ran in the dark outside.\\n\\n“Come on, Riley, let’s go.”\\n\\n“Go with your dad.  Call me later.”  Alex switched the light back off.  From across the street, concrete crosses of graves made silhouettes against a dead pale sky.  It was a familiar sight for me by then.  My father never said anything in the car, at least nothing I can remember.\\n\\nAt the house, my sisters and mother dressed and got ready for school like any other Monday morning. I walked up to the third floor, and my skin crawled in desperation.  Sobriety was unacceptable.  I wanted to die or be sedated.\\n\\nI laid the foil of cocaine under the lamp on my bedside dresser.  It looked like a gram and a half of coke, but when I gummed it and rubbed it on my lips, it didn’t numb me up.  The cocaine was no good, so I chopped all of it up and snorted it in one line.  It burned badly, but as soon as it hit the back of my throat, I knew it was several times a lethal dose of heroin, the stuff we called China white.\\n\\nI walked downstairs to my get some juice.  My father cooked breakfast, and the smell of bacon fat filled the kitchen.\\n\\n“Poppa, I want some orange juice.  Can we go get some?”  He poked the bacon popping in the frying pan.  His left hand rested in his pocket, and I looked around in the refrigerator door open.\\n\\n“Not right now.  Go upstairs and go to sleep in the TV room.”\\n\\n10 minutes later my little sister found me.  Green vomit covered my clothes and most of the couch.  The dying blood in my face turned my complexion gray, and my eyes rolled all the way back into my head.  She ran to get my father who had returned from buying orange juice.\\n\\nAs a veterinarian he knew how the basics of keeping something alive, so he got on his knees and pumped my chest with his hands.  A large glob of brown snot ejected from my nostrils, but vomit still blocked my airway.  He sucked it into his mouth and spat it out to help me breathe.  With bile on my lips, he put his mouth to mine and blew in breath.  He could have breathed for me for days, but the amount of heroin in my system meant certain death.\\n\\nOn a Monday morning before school, my sisters waited on the front porch for the ambulance.  My mother shook, doubled over in the doorway and watched her husband attempt to keep her only son alive.  My father breathed for me and pushed on my chest.  I lay on the ground dying like I wanted.  My respiratory system would shut down, and soon my heart would quit pumping.  17 years into this life and I was already on my way out.  How could I do that to my mother and father?  How could I do that to my sisters?  How could I do that to myself?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen I was a kid, my father used to ride bikes with me down the levee to throw rocks into the river at sunset, and during his workdays, he packed me around in the passenger seat of his Landcruiser while he made calls to clients.  Everywhere we went everyone knew him and wanted his attention.  They said, “Hey, Doc!  Hey, Doc!  Hey, Doc!”  We went to different horse barns and properties throughout the countryside.  One night we hooked a chain to his front bumper and tried to pull a dead calf out of its mother as it got dark outside and afterwards he let me have a sip of his beer in the back of the Landcruiser.  I used to ask him every question I ever had, and he always knew the answer.  He was the smartest man in the world.\\n\\nAt some stables, he pointed and said, “A horse kicked me in the knee, and I cried under that tree.”  I didn’t believe him, because my dad never cried.  At his clinic he was in charge of everything and everyone.   One evening while visiting the bayou a man got shot in the head in a hunting accident.  I watched my dad suck the bloody foam out of his throat, until help came.  The guy eventually died, but not while my dad was working on him.\\n\\nThe first time it occurred to me that I really loved him and he loved me, I was 4 years old.  He led me on a horse through a gate into a riding ring when I thought it.  One time I had an awful cough, and he stayed up with me to give me medicine and make sure I was okay.  My very first memory is on his hairy chest, waking from sleep, to choke back chunks of vomit in my throat.   He took a break from putting together some crawler or toy for me to drink a beer and read on the chase lounge under a lamp.  I was his only baby boy once upon a time, and he held me in his arms.\\n\\nBut now he knelt over me and pumped my chest with both of his hands and breathed for me, while he waited for the ambulance he hoped would come fast enough to save me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe paramedics and firemen tried to get me to walk downstairs to the ambulance and go to the hospital, but I tried to bite them.  In the ER, I spewed green vomit all over the floor and ripped the IVs out of my arm to get water out of a sink.  It was Children’s Hospital, and young children were dying in the beds around me.  It was an ordeal, but I survived.\\n\\nWhether it was an attempted suicide by overdose or not, I did not know, but everyone seemed to think it was.  I would have rather died than deal with the problems waiting for me on the other side of surviving.  My mother’s father, Turkey, sat in a chair next to me, and I gave him a hard time about them not allowing me any water.  I asked him if he wanted me to vomit in his mouth.\\n\\nHe laughed.  I was his oldest grandchild, and he called me Turkey like I called him Turkey.  He used to wake up before the sun to drink vodka in the 1970s, but in that hospital room, he had 28 years sober.\\n\\n\n",



                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Like so many of the greatest stories ever told, this one, also, begins with a dirty microwave.  The pitiful machine watched me from the corner like a terrified child, while I paced in the dark and colluded violence.  It was not long before I got crazy and stuffed her into a roll around suitcase in an attempt to collect her ransom from some villains I knew.  The kidnapping was going well, until I got a greedy itch on the way to make the exchange and robbed the Scholtzky’s in the parking lot of my apartment complex.  It was 50 feet from my front door.  The manager and cashiers knew us by name.  My accomplice was an old, crippled man on crutches, and the suitcase had my information on it when we got arrested.  It wasn’t my best day, but then again it wasn’t my worst.  Let me tell you what happened.\\n-------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nAfter letting me stay with his family in New Mexico for a month, Cheo helped me get signed up for school in Santa Fe and find a place to live at the Warren Inn.  It was a new chance at life after all the havoc I wrought before now.  I was clean.  The itchy rash on my legs was going away.  Spring semester started, and I had a little girlfriend so things were looking good.\\n\\nThe girl liked me, even though the Valentine’s Day card I gave her had another girl’s name scratched out and hers scribbled beneath it.  It was hand drawn, and somehow I had managed to rhyme violet and toilet in the poem on the inside of the card.  Our relationship ended as soon as I found out that my next-door neighbor could score heroine and cocaine, and that happened the night before my father went back home after his visit in late February.\\n\\n\\nIt was a Saturday night, and I told my dad that I was going to see the girl.  It would be a good excuse to ask for 20 bucks and give me an opportunity to try scoring at the mall.  But when I couldn’t find anything, I walked back to see if my neighbor could help me out.  He opened the door a few seconds after I knocked and told me his name was Tracy.  A man named Larry with big hair and leather cowboy boots had a knee brace and crutches and sat in the corner next to an empty spoon like a proud Hispanic rooster.  I spoke low so my dad wouldn’t hear me through the wall.\\n\\n“Can you get anything?”\\n\\n“You’re not a cop are you?  Whatever I get you, you have to do in front of me, so I know you’re not a cop.”\\n\\n“Yeah.  That’s no problem.  I sort of need to do it here.  My dad’s in my room.”\\n\\nIn 10 minutes, he took my 20 bucks out to the parking lot and came right back.  He dropped a black chunk in a small baggie on the nightstand next to my chair, for me to see under the light.  It was exciting to know that my neighbor had a solid hook up for heroin and cocaine as Tracy handed me a spoon.  I cooked it up and pulled the brown liquid through the tiny cotton filter and into my syringe.\\n\\nI had not shot up heroine in a month or two, and the stint of abstinence made for a dramatic effect of the drug.  It was the same as in Frisco only more intense.  My blood got warm and my stomach got queasy.  The constriction of my pupils, blood vessels and lungs felt like an elephant stepped on my back.  Breath became shallow.  Words creaked out of me like bullfrog croaks and fell onto my chest.  My eyelids hung heavy and swollen.  My nose itched, and I got the hiccups before I puked in his garbage can.  He told me to come back in the morning if I wanted more.\\n\\nMy dad took off that next morning like he had planned.  It was not the best visit.  Sure I was off of the streets, but when he showed up my mattress didn’t have sheets.  He had to take me to buy them.  My clothes, room, hair and life in general were more disheveled than he liked to see.  He gave me 20 bucks to get a haircut while he was there, but when I came back it was still halfway to my shoulders.  It made him mad, and he made me go back to get a real haircut.  Before he left he hunched over in the wind and counted out 200 dollars for me in the parking lot outside of my building.  He seemed frustrated, because it didn’t look like anything was really going to change with me even if he thought I was sober for the moment.\\n\\nWithin a week something like 300 unopened condoms littered the whole room with heroin cookers, rubber tourniquets, baggies of cotton balls and alcohol swabs from the needle exchange.  Trash was everywhere, and a film of cigarette tar and ashes covered the windows and mirrors.  Feces piled high out of the toilet that had quit working weeks before.  I systematically broke into every car in the parking lot one night and kept the useless loot.  I found one half of a 20-dollar bill, 3 small bags of dirt weed, several briefcases full of what appeared to be dried out potting soil (if that can even be believed), a broken ironing board, and manila folders full of someone else’s old resumes, among other things.  It was all on the floor in my room that stunk and stayed dark like me.\\n\\nThe Warren Inn was full of sad people living sad lives who barely survived on food stamps and the crumbs they had left for the month after paying rent with their SSI.  That’s why the cars had nothing good to steal.  A crazy guy invited me into his room on the second floor of my building and read from a notebook some things he had written.  There were jars of urine and feces in the corner.  I knew another guy who was pushing 60.  I guessed.  It was a sad reality in his room, the 2 times I was there, and it was more than I could hope for myself if I continued the way I was.  His motor skills and the air of his sophistication were on par with most three year olds I knew, and his dress only added to it: an old bomber jacket, cowboy boots, ear muffs and a pair of ski goggles just to ride the bus.  He had lost all of his teeth from a life of alcoholic neglect and didn’t seem to care.  His breath and the texture of his white skin made me wonder if he wasn’t just a clump of yeast and dough that had somehow become sentient.\\n\\nOne day I shot up a syringe full of cocaine and Tracy’s blood even after he told me had Hepatitis C.  Another day I saw one of the neighbor couples get into a fight and the man chased off after the woman, so I ran into their room and stole a pair of boots, a leather jacket, a sleeve of chocolate chip cookies and a sleeve of saltines.\\nAt the IHOP one night, I tried to dine and dash but stuffed myself too full of French toast and couldn’t run.\\n\\nLarry moved into my room and whatever self-perceived dignity or pomp Larry projected that first night in Tracy’s apartment had withered with his frame.  Now he stood on his crutches and stared into the bathroom mirror, shooting thick mixtures of cocaine and heroine into his neck.  His once beautifully conditioned and manicured hair had turned into a matted ball of lint exaggerated by his skeletal frame and highlighted by the purple track marks running down his jugular veins.  There were stragglers who came in and out of my room day and night.  A 24-year-old guy we called Popeye, stopped by frequently and bragged about kicking in doors and raping women.\\n\\n\\nThe morning that I tried to rob the Schlotzky’s, I stole 7 Ativan out of the bottle in Larry’s coat pocket while he slept in a pile of trash in the corner.  It had been a hard night for me as I was sick and unable to sleep from a lack of heroine.  He sat up and patted his chest to feel for the bottles when he woke up at around 10 and pulled them out to take some.  11 pills had turned into 4 while he slept, and when he looked at me I just said I was sorry.\\n\\nI made empty promises to repay him, but when he demanded proof, I ripped the microwave out of the wall and stuffed it into the red roll around suitcase.  It still had a laminated card from my grandmother’s travel agency and my own information on it.\\n\\n“Call Luna!  Tell him to bring a dub!”\\n\\n“What?  You think he is going to want that nasty, little thing?  You’ve lost it.”\\n\\n“Just call him!  I’ll deal with him when he gets here!”\\n\\nLarry called him, and I could tell Luna was trying to confirm that we had money over the phone, but Larry danced around it until Luna agreed to come anyway.  I slid my arms into the sleeves of my NASCAR racing jacket and headed across the parking lot with Larry hobbling on crutches.  It was a number 24, Jeff Gordon racing jacket, bright red with blue flames up the sleeves and a bright blue DUPONT logo on the front.  My mom had ordered it for me brand new, to replace the old dirty one she made me throw away a month earlier in California.  Larry’s crutches creaked in the cold across the asphalt.  The suitcase rolled behind me and half of the microwave stuck out of it while the chord dragged behind.\\n\\n\\nAs if the bright red racing jacket and microwave halfway hanging out of my suitcase and the raggedy old man on crutches didn’t attract enough attention or make us easy to identify, the whole crew of that Schlotzky’s knew us by name.  They always let us wait for Luna in the store out of the cold and even gave us free drinks from the soda fountain.\\n\\nThe manager smiled at us and asked us how we were doing and walked back to the drive-up window.  It was not likely that Luna would accept the microwave and not likely that he would give us a ride to hock it for the measly five bucks it would fetch.  I jumped over the counter to hit the cash out button.  The drawer opened, and I took a couple 20-dollar bills.  When the other girl on shift saw me she screamed for the manager.\\n\\nI handed Larry a 20 and ran through the parking lot behind the Warren Inn.  Somehow I knew to get rid of my bright red jacket and went to my room from the other side of the building to change my clothes.  The sunglasses, headphones, blue Dickies jacket and backwards Kangol cap were enough of a change that when the cops came into the building to look for me, they asked me if I had seen myself running by in a red jacket.\\n\\n“No, officer, I haven’t seen him.” I tried to walk down the road but it was too cold.\\n\\nI walked to the other building and knocked on the yeast ball’s door.  A few days before this I sold him 20 dollars of laundry detergent and watched him put it in his arm while I did the coke he bought.  He knew I ripped him off, but there was nowhere else to go now.  The cops were coming.  I knocked again, but there was no response.\\n\\nWhen I finally walked back to the room to meet the cops in the hallway, they smashed my face into the wall and handcuffed me.  They already had Larry in the back of a squad car with his crutches and the 20 that I gave him.  The cops told me they would let me go with just a ticket if I could give them back the other 20, but Larry had warrants and was going to jail either way.  As bold as it was to jump over the counter and help myself to the money in the cash box, the cops only charged me petty larceny.\\n\\nSitting there in handcuffs, I wasn’t embarrassed by the gawking onlookers and slowing traffic.  At 19 that was just who I was, a criminal junkie, and that is what criminal junkies did.  They got arrested at 10:30 on a Tuesday morning for being embarrassingly inept at crime and the whole world saw it.  The officers talked amongst themselves and said that they wouldn’t go into the room to look for the other 20 because of the filth and stench.\\n\\nLarry and I spent three days in jail and went to court on Friday.  I took my charges and told the judge that I had only come to town for school.  I told him that it was a mystery to me how I ended up in that situation, and he let me go with time served.  Cheo picked me up a week later and took me back to his house to clean up.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Her haircut let you know that she didn’t care what you thought.  There was no guard on the clippers when she ran them back over her ears without a mirror and left the tuft of blonde hair on top.  She had more bag under her eyes than cheek and those deep creases circled down her face and back up to her brown eyes as testimonies to her life of suffering and loss.  She only had half of her top teeth, and she sold drugs from her queen-sized bed in dirty cotton panties and bare breasted.  An old stretchmark ran jagged like a bolt of lightning through her doughy abdomen that hung over the elastic waistband of her stained panties.\\n-------------\\nThe state took her daughter a year before I met her, and she had a son with her brother who was taken long before that.  She told me about being molested as a child like she missed it.  There was nothing she wasn’t into even though she claimed to only like girls.  Breezy mentioned an affinity for bestiality once, particularly canines and boasted of her videotaped endeavors.  Before I tried to rob her, I fell in love.\\n-----------\\n\\nSometimes I sat on the park block benches in a cold, gray drizzle.  A stranger might hand me a grease stained box half filled with some unidentifiable sludge and a chunk of what was alleged to be chicken breast, or I might beat out the last bit of my peach yogurt onto my blackened palm before licking it up unashamed and starving for passersby to see.\\n\\nOther times I had spells of de ja vu like I had seen these very same things in the same order in a dream a long time ago, or maybe it was the effect of living the same reality over and over again as the universe exploded out of nothing and created everything before it imploded in on itself and did it again.\\n\\nOne time I sat back after dinner in a soup kitchen, and tears streamed down the faces of two girls singing worship songs at the homeless shelter.  They sang, “You give and take away.  You give and take away.”  The theology struck me as odd, but I appreciated the passion before their friend came out to give his testimony of being a depressed teenager who found life and joy in Jesus Christ.  I thought that sounded nice but didn’t apply to me.  There were holes in my arms that had to be filled, and I regarded nothing as sacred.\\n\\nAnd another time I met a 54-year-old woman named Donna squatting against the wall next to me out of the rain and smoking a cigarette. She wore funeral parlor perfume that seemed to be mingled with the aromas of mental illness and mildew.  Her mascara ran in the rain, and flecks of red lipstick stuck to her teeth.  She bit her cigarette.  She punched me in the shoulder.  She pointed her finger.\\n\\n“Look at that!”  A dramatic scene unfolded 60 feet from where we crouched.  EMTs rolled a blue lipped and grey faced person in a gurney out of Fred Meyer’s and into the back of the ambulance.  I couldn’t tell if the person was a man or a woman.  I just knew they were ugly.\\n\\n“Who’s that?”\\n\\n“Jerianne.  I guess she’s not coming back to the apartment with me this afternoon.  Bahaha.  Screwed it up?  Didn’t ya, Jerianne?  She always does!”  She threw the rest of her cigarette into a puddle. “You wanna come home with me?”\\n\\n\\nWe walked west a few blocks and took a left up a steep hill to her apartment where she told me about how perverted the attendant at the corner gas station was and then let me crawl all over her in the dark.  Afterwards we smoked cigarettes and talked in bed.\\n\\n“My son died 4 years ago in a car accident on the coast in Washington.  He was everything to me.  He was all I had.  I tried to kill myself last month with my methadone and colonopin but it didn’t work.  I took my whole month’s worth of methadone and my colonopin too, but I woke up in the morning.  The doctors filled my scripts again but now I have to take classes three days a week for the nine more months, and I still wish I was dead.”\\n\\nThat’s life though.  One morning you’re on your knees kissing your pregnant wife’s belly and buying diapers and rolling out pink paint on the \\nwalls of the room with the crib for the baby girl you’ll be bringing home any day now, but the next morning you’re on your knees in a hospital waiting room clutching your face and screaming with blood on your shirt and trying to understand why.  It happens.  People lose their most precious relationships in an instant, and there’s nothing they can do about it but die themselves.  She chose a slow death and hurt all along the way.\\n\\nWe rented movies from the library and watched them over and over without ever knowing what they were about, because we snored through them.  Anything filmed in the early 90s invoked strong feelings for me, because they were from when I was a kid, before the hatred consummated within.  I dreamed of living the life of one of the unnamed extras and disappearing into the fictitious background of Lethal Weapon 2 or Backdraft where life was of no consequence and Michael Jordan was winning championships in Chicago. It was not uncommon for her to wake up with large holes burnt into her sheets from nodding out with lit cigarettes.\\n\\n“Did I set my bed on fire last night?  I think I remember that!  Haha!  Yeah.  Now I remember.  I woke up and the sheets were on fire.  There was a fire last night!  Yup.  Sure was.  Jeesh!  You’d think that I’d remember something like that.  Haha!  Almost burned myself up in a fire and the whole building too.  Haha!”\\n\\nIn the daytime, she helped me boost merchandise from stores, but I was good at it even without her.  I strategized to either be in and out as quickly as possible, or if I thought a secret shopper was following me, I would walk from one side of the store up an aisle back to the other side, and down another aisle, and back up it.  If anyone followed me for all of that, I would ask him why he was following me.  They never knew what to say.  If they were on the phone, I would ask them to say hello to their mothers for me.  If they were in the health food section, I asked what a tub of lard like them was doing buying raw organic almonds.  Sometimes, I would fill a hand basket and get their attention by walking toward the door and drop it, right before I walked out.  Then, while they put the items back or talked to each other about it in the room full of monitors, I would walk back through the store and steal what I wanted.  Donna kept lookout, and I filled my bags with DVDs and walked out with my arms full of merchandise and the alarms going off.\\n\\nShe kicked me out one morning after I got high and slept on the couch.  A few days after that I got high on meth and texted her from under a dumpster about her naked 54-year-old body and what I wanted to do it.  She forwarded the explicit messages along with her own haranguing texts to my mother every day for weeks.  My mom told me that Donna sent 28 texts before noon on a Tuesday, and none of them made any sense.\\n\\nIn late May I found a cup of cold coffee in a trashcan and threw it on her downtown.  She called the cops and tried to tell them I was a thief, which they already knew but couldn’t take me to jail on.  It was in Pioneer Square where I used to sit and wait for licks or plant my feet in one spot with straight legs and fold at the waist like a taco trying to touch my nose to my big toe and drooling. People always stopped and woke me up to ask if I was okay or if I needed some help, but I was doing great.\\n\\nI moved for work after that and came the city to pick up from this girl I met.  Her name was Breezy, and it was good to have a steady hook up even if it meant riding the bus two hours out to he place and two hours back to where I slept every night. I did day labor and slept under the awning of a nail salon across the street. At four I woke up to catch rides with the crew out to the landfill where we worked. The guy who drove had the aura of a potato. He wore a leather jacket. He drove a truck. He grew a bushy beard. He mumbled something about alimony payments and a daughter on our cigarette break once, but when I pictured him going home to his sad life, he was a potato, a soft, lumpy potato crying on his pillow.  After a few weeks, the company fired me for stealing other people’s lunches and sleeping in the bushes while on the clock, but I tried to make life in Vancouver work anyway.  I didn’t give up until the incident in which a local army veteran paid me five dollars and a 99-cent cheeseburger to deposit a certain bodily fluid on a lacy pair of panties in a graveyard.  Then I moved back to the city.\\n\\nOn a Saturday night, a stumbling and drunk Mexican flashed the money in his wallet at me by Voodoo doughnuts.  He wanted me to be his date or sex or something, but it ended up that he spent about five minutes licking the side of my face while I got his wallet out of his back pocket and took the money.  It was a 200-dollar come up, and I skipped around town until I pulled my money out to buy crack from a big group of black men in China town.  They jumped me badly and robbed me.\\n\\nAs Sunday morning broke the splatter of cold rain on the sidewalk soaked into my newspaper blankets under a Chinatown stoop.  I couldn’t sleep, and the loss of the 200 dollars was my only thought.  My leg and hip hurt from getting jumped.  It had been such a happy moment to have that money in my pocket for the morning, but I called Breezy anyway and appealed to her compassion.  She told me to come see her in an apartment downtown where she was getting tattooed.\\n\\nIn the room, Breezy and her 19 year old girlfriend laid face down to get lace tattooed down the back of their legs.  It was an ordeal, and they squirmed and squealed.  The lady whose place it was kept talking to her dead girlfriend like she was floating in the room with us, and their tattoo artist asked if he should start a mobile tattoo business even though it was illegal. Breezy gave me a hit to hold me over, and we hung out for a while before I left.\\n\\nI bought from her a lot, because she was reliable and always holding and generous.  She fronted or gave me dope, because she liked me.  It wasn’t long after we met that I came to see her at her hotel room to find her jerking around her room collecting some belongings in a bag and sweating in a curly blonde wig.\\n\\n“Here you go.  Can you watch my place for me?  Some f***ing scumbag tried to rob me earlier.  I need someone here if he tries to come back.”  She handed me a few chunks of heroin and meth.  Maybe she had reason to think the place was about to get raided and wouldn’t mind if I took the fall.  \\n\\n“Yeah, I can watch the place.”\\n\\n“I don’t know why, but I trust you.  I’ll be back tomorrow.”  Her girlfriend wasn’t around.  She was with a guy, and they took off in a truck.  Later, she used this incident to make me feel special and said,\\n\\n“You are special.  I never trust people like that, but I knew you were different from the start.”\\n\\nIt took her a day or so to come back, and we got close when she did.  Breezy chased her 19-year-old girlfriend off for being paranoid and jealous, before she moved on to the next fling.  I texted Danielle back in Cincinatti even though she was with another guy, and I complained about my heartache to Breezy.  Breezy asked me if I thought she liked to hear about Danielle.\\n\\nBreezy would finally fall asleep at around 4 a.m.  Sometimes earlier, but when she was out she could not be woken up.  Slapping her didn’t work.  Screaming was useless.  We never tried pouring cold water, but it seemed doubtful that it would make any difference.  It was a problem, because people wanted to buy 24/7. Most nights before she fell asleep she would send me and whoever was around with money for cigarettes, scratch tickets, grape red vines, fun dip, sour patch explodes, donuts and apple fritters which were her favorite.  She filled the grape licorice with the sugar from the fun dip and handed them out like the loaded syringes she handed out earlier in the day.  Then she would pass out and wake up in the morning raging and throwing things.\\n\\nShe gave me five balloons of heroine one morning and sent me to sell them downtown, but before I took off with my bag and a long board Breezy pulled out a huge bottle of random pills from which I took three.  I had not slept or eaten in days, and she sent me off ten minutes later with a sweaty peck on the cheek and aggravated by how badly I was slurring my words.\\n\\nAt the Nordstram Rack I packed as many bottles of cologne into my black book bag and some fabric grocery bags I had, even though I could see stout men with earpieces watching me through the glass doors.  It was the 4th time I had been there to rob the place of cologne in 2 weeks, and it was also obvious that the men were part of a sting operation set up to stop me.  I kept going anyway and juggled the 5 heroine balloons in my mouth with my tongue on the way out.  As soon as the door opened, a voice screamed,\\n\\n“STOP RIGHT THERE!!!!”\\n\\nI bolted down the street after a woman scratched my neck, and I punched her. She chased me and screamed for someone to stop me.  A man with long hair grabbed my backpack, and 3 yellow balloons fell out of my mouth and onto the sidewalk.  I broke free and skated to some festival at the park by the river.  There were cops looking for me, so I took off my hat and jacket, hid the skateboard under a bridge and walked around talking to strangers.  Cop cars drove by every 30 seconds looking for someone but never stopped me.\\n\\nLater I did the two balloons I had in my mouth, and after a few hours I went to see if the other balloons were still on the ground.  They were, and I sold one and did the rest of them under a bridge as night fell, because I wasn’t going back to the hotel.  I told Breezy that I messed it all up when she called, and she cried,\\n\\n“Come back.  I don’t care.  It doesn’t matter to me.  I want you back here.  You are too important to me.”\\n\\nThe days at Breezy’s went by hot and slow.  It was June, and it seemed like everyone was in and out all day everyday.  We never had time together, and I could tell she wanted to get me alone.  The place finally cleared out one afternoon, and I said,\\n\\n“I’m leaving, too,” to scavenge for something to trade her for more drugs.\\n\\n“Why would you leave now?  Huh?  Everyone finally left us alone and now you want to leave?  What’s wrong with you?”  Desperation and hurt squeezed through her voice box from across the room.\\n\\n“Oh.  I didn’t know you wanted me to stay.”  I knew she wanted to have sex with me, and I felt the same, mostly from the drugs and the weird bio chemical things that happen when a boy and girl spend too much time together.  “I’m here, then.”  She put her legs up on the table, and we both grimaced at a bad smell in the room.\\n\\n“I’m going to take a shower.”\\n\\nShe told everyone about it.  Her friend, Gay Kevin, told me she said it was the best she had in a long time, and I was proud of myself.  But as the days continued the meth overrode the heroin, and I never slept except the time she made me and I spilled water all over her in the bed.  She laughed about it and changed the sheets, but she could be really mean too, like when I repeated myself.\\n\\n“Yeah, I know, Riley.  You already said that.  Try saying something different.  I’m tired of hearing the same old s*** from you all the time.”  But, she was kind to me about the water I spilled on her.  When I needed a haircut, she sat me down in the kitchen and cut it.  She did a good job, too.  I kept shaved for her because that’s what she liked.\\n\\n“Thanks for the hit, baby.”\\n\\n“Riley?”\\n\\n“Yeah, baby?”\\n\\n“Don’t call me baby.  That’s not my f***ing name!”  I pretended I never heard it and referred to her as babes within a half hour.\\n\\n\\n\\nI stalked up and down the road in the June sun, Quasimodo’s skeleton sweating and scheming all day, marching back and forth to the department store.  Someone told me shooting up in the thin veins in my wrists was the most likely place to kill me with a clot.  I didn’t know if it was true, but I shot up there just in case.  Everyone told me the same thing, “You don’t need a gun, Riley.  Armed robbery is not worth it.”  But it was more about putting a bullet in the ceiling, jumping onto the counter and screaming for everyone to get on the ground.  It was my new obsession but no one would give me a gun.  I fantasized armed robbery in Breezy’s kitchen and sweated listening for cars through the blinds.\\n\\nShe punched me in the face one night for trying to defend myself against some grievance one of her ex-girlfriends had against me.  It was getting more and more difficult to be there, and it seemed like she hated me.  One night she had sex with several guys right in front of me and wouldn’t even look at me when I talked to her afterwards.  I kept trying to get her attention, but Gay Kevin said,\\n\\n“Let it alone.  She don’t want to talk to you right now.”  He knew her better than I did, but I tried to grab her bags of meth and heroine to insult her.  She hid the dope under her butt and told me to leave.   As I made my way towards the door, one of the guys she slept with screamed obscenities and threats of stabbing me from the bathroom.\\n\\nI’ve always heard that Roosevelt said, “Speak softly and carry a big stick.” I ran my mouth and when that didn’t work I used whatever I could to impose my will and destroy things.  In this case it happened to be the wooden bat she kept by the door. I jumped over the bed and almost kicked the pocket door down before I pulled him out by his hair and drove the bat like a splitting maul to his head.  It connected on the side of his skull behind his ear.  He crumpled to the ground.\\n\\nBreezy jumped onto my back, so I reached behind her head and hooked her armpit to body slam her onto the floor.  She gasped as the wind knocked out of her.  Gay Kevin charged me but bounced off me and went to the ground like an empty Styrofoam cup in the wind, and we spent the next few minutes in a tornado of random objects flying around the room.  I launched Breezy backwards through the air with my legs.  The blinds came down with her, and she moaned like she might be seriously hurt.  The men shook in fear as I backed towards the door and grabbed a sleeping back on my way out.  My stay there was up, and the cops were coming.\\n\\nIn a room of what were supposed to be hardened criminals, violent types, people to be feared I was the only one living up to my persona and the things I said.  Everyone bluffed and lied about the danger they presented, but like a poker game I laid down four aces almost every time the chips were on the table.  They all had nothing in their hands, and you can’t win with nothing when your bluff is called.  It wasn’t that I was tough or bad.  If anything I was a coward and selfish and stupid most of all, but I had soaked up everything I ever saw or heard since I was little like a sponge.  I adapted and thrived in any environment that didn’t kill me.  My environments were criminal and my life was violent, so that’s what I was good at.\\n\\nThe sirens wailed in the distance.  There was a boarded up strip club a block away where I hid in the bushes behind it with my sleeping bag.  I went back into Portland the next morning and never saw Breezy again.\\n\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  We were faithful practitioners of an antique religion.  It originated in 19th century Asia, but a vein of revival made its way up from Mexico in the early nineteen nineties.  Upon conversion, we sold all we had to follow our goddess.  We lived for her, and in back alleys and hotel rooms all around the city, we built altars to her with blackened spoons, the bottom halves of aluminum cans, needles, empty cigarette boxes and lighters.  We practiced the ritual of cooking magical potions, conjuring up blissful sleep and vapor the smell of vinegar and brown sugar.  We vomited and hiccupped as a rite of passage.  Daily devotions involved tying ourselves off, kneeling before her altar and letting blood from our arms.  We were ready to sacrifice our first born if she asked.\\n------------------\\nHeroin was life for us, and without her we were dead.  Every heartbeat.  Every thought.  Every move.  Every drop of gasoline in the car.  Every cent we made.  Every calorie we consumed.  Every breath was devoted to the chase for more.\\n-------------------\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFour Hondurans started selling heroin and cocaine at five in the morning.  They came like clockwork, because they got off the first bus that brought them to the park.  Besides Chivo, it was the only other place we knew to get heroin in town, and it was the only place it was available at five a.m.  Chivo started at eight, but sickness started early.  They sold dimes, or ten dollars’ worth, in tightly wrapped balls made from cut squares of trash bag.  Black was heroine.  White was cocaine.  They sold five for 40 dollars as an incentive to buyers and allowed any combination.\\n\\nWe woke up before five, sick as usual.  I gathered together the random CDs in the car and went to see if one of the Hondurans in the park would trade a dime of black for them.  Roger was the one we knew best, but he laughed at my offer.  He seemed annoyed.  He would not even look at me.\\n\\nWe were out of luck, so we parked next to a Seven Eleven.  In the car, we stretched and yawned.  Our bodies ached, and the anxiety set in.  We never knew where we would get it.  We just had to have it.  Watery snot and tears started, the sure signs of dope sickness.\\n\\n“What are we going to do, bubby?”  Danielle lay back in the passenger seat.\\n\\n“I don’t know, baby.  I’m tired.  We can call Chivo and ask for another front, or we can do something, but it’s too early to call Chivo.  Let me chill for a minute.  We’ll get it.  Don’t worry. I don’t know how but we will.”  She always said she liked me better when I was sick.  Heroine made me extremely mean and difficult.  When I was sick, I felt exposed and sensitive.  Television commercials brought tears to my eyes, and I was nice to her.\\n\\n“OK, bubby.  I’m sick as s***.”  She held her stomach.\\n\\n“I know, baby.  Me too.”  I folded my arms and closed my eyes.  My back and head ached.  I pushed back into the driver’s seat.  Not two minutes passed before we heard a knock on the window.\\n\\nA strange individual tried to talk to us through the closed window.  Thick glasses, a shaved head, orange freckles on pale skin, a gaunt face.  Maybe a man.  Maybe a lesbian.  I tried to tell the person to wait till we rolled the window down, but they continued to talk.  As the window lowered, I could hear he was a man.\\n\\n“I need a ride out of here!  Right now!  I’ve got money!  I’ll pay you.  I have to get out of this state!”  He seemed genuinely desperate for our help.  Through the window he flashed several bills, mostly ones and a five.  It was good enough for me.\\n\\n“Get in!”\\n\\nDanielle had to open her door to open the door for him to crawl into the back, and we took off.\\n\\n“Where do you want to go?”  I didn’t know where he went.  There was nothing in the back seat, but a pile of clothes.\\n\\n“I don’t know!  Anywhere, out of here!”  His voice came from the clothes.  He had buried himself in the pile of unfolded and dirty clothes.\\n\\n“Well, maybe you could give us a little more direction.  If you pay, we’ll take you anywhere you want.”  I remembered the condition of my release from jail.  My travels were not to exceed a 150-mile radius from there, but money was on the line.  He never gave us a destination.  \\n\\n\\n\\nTraffic halted for miles on the interstate.  It was from people headed to work, so we were stuck for a while.  He talked about the people chasing him.  They wanted to kill him, and the cops would send him to prison.  He had spent the previous night jumping fences to escape.  A day or two before that, he threw away several ounces in a hotel room of the casino, because he thought he was being set up.  Danielle and I knew what he needed.\\n\\n“Why don’t you let us get you some heroin?  That’ll calm you down.  We can get a hotel room and get some brown.  Hey, what’s your name anyway?  If we are going to be helping you escape and partners in crime, we should know each other’s names.”\\n\\n“I’m Carl.”\\n\\n“I’m Riley.  This is Danielle.”\\n\\nHe agreed that getting heroin was a good idea, so we pulled off at the next exit, and called Chivo.  We found a Motel 6, and she checked into the room, for us.  He snuck in while we waited for Chivo.  We never had much money to score, so Chivo’s driver hurried to meet us at the gas station down the street.  Out of the four 50-dollar balloons, Carl gave us three to share, which he did several more times.  He always gave us three and kept one.  It was Christmas morning, and we were little kids.\\n\\nWhen Danielle and I got high, we bickered and said nasty things to one another, not as a matter of any real hurt or problems we had, but like an allergic reaction to the heroin.  There were two or three days in a row of us sitting in a dark, cool Motel 6 room watching HBO high on heroin and Danielle and I squabbling.  Carl spent time on his computer and whined about our fussing and fighting.\\n\\n“You guys should love one another.  You never know when you won’t have the other one with you again.”  He whimpered.  His life was hard, one of six boys, the youngest, and regularly raped by one of his brothers.  His father hated him.  He found love with an old man named Tony, who taught him the trade of stealing fine art, paintings and such.  They were busted together and sent to different prisons where Tony died of AIDS, I guessed.  Danielle and I thought Carl turned tricks off the Internet for the money he had, but we had no proof.  On our third day together, he had us drop him off in the middle of nowhere, because he did not want to hear us fight.  His countenance was quiet and depressed, and he wouldn’t make eye contact.\\n\\nDanielle and I came back from trying to score all day at around 630 to find Carl outside of the room waiting for us.  He got four balloons as usual, but this time he only gave us one and kept three.  Then he gave us 20 bucks and sent us to Wendy’s to get some dinner.\\n\\nCarl lay on the floor sweaty and flaccid by the time we got back to the room.  A few slaps to the face and yells of his name proved he had overdosed.  Danielle shrieked and flapped her hands at her face in fear, while I ran to the bathroom and saturated a hand towel with water.  When I rung it out over his face and the water hit him he came to.\\n\\n“Hey, mother f***er, we’re calling 911!  You need to go to the hospital!”  I didn’t take his attempt at suicide personally.  It was his prerogative far as I saw it, but overdosing himself in the hotel room where we slept was unacceptable.\\n\\n“No!  No! No!  Don’t call the ambulance.  I’m okay.  I’m okay.”  He begged us not to call.  I listened to him, for some reason.  Soon after all of it, I regretted not robbing him for all his money and sending him overdosed to the hospital.  We would have been gone with his electronics and money before he got out of the hospital.\\n\\nWe feared that he would asphyxiate, so we made him sit up against the corner of the room on his bed while we watched TV.  The blankets were around him, and she and I must have given cues that I was nodding out with our conversation.  His eyes were closed, but he was awake.\\n\\n“See?  Riley is nodding out.  Why doesn’t he have to go to the hospital?”\\n\\n“Shut the f*** up, Carl.  Or we will call 911 to come get your overdosing a**.”  It was 1030.\\n\\n“It’s not fair.  You are as high as I am.”\\n\\n“Shut the f*** up, Carl!”\\n\\nHe was snoring at 130 when I went to sleep.  The Hangover played mute on the TV.  Danielle woke me up at 10.\\n\\n“Riley.  Riley.  Wake up.  I think he’s dead.”\\n\\n“No, he’s not dead.”  I opened my eyes and looked at him.  I was not so sure.\\n\\n“I’m pretty sure he’s dead, bubby!  He looks dead!”\\n\\n“No.  He’s not dead.  Let’s find a rinse before we check.”\\n\\nWe found the bottom half of a coke can on a shelf below the TV.  It had a spot of brown goo on the edge with a gray, shriveled cotton in the middle.  It was all that was left of the three balloons he did the day before.  I wondered how he even managed to get that much tar into a syringe and inject it while we were at Wendy’s.  I thought he must have skin-popped it.  It would have been several injections of black sludge, and if he had hit a vein the first one would have put him out.\\n\\nWe washed the bottom of the coke can with water and even sucked it through his old cotton.  It was not the clean thing to do, but we didn’t care.  She peed on the toilet and kept telling me he was dead while I split the syringes of slightly colored water.  I denied it one more time before I hit a vein in her arm and then my own.\\n\\nI walked out first and went over to his bed.  I focused on his mouth and the strand of drool hanging from his chin.  It was dried out and stuck there, the consistency of hair sprayed spider web.  When I put my hand on his shoulder to shake him awake, I said, “Carl!”  But he rolled over, cold and stiff.  His legs never unfolded or changed position.  The dried-out stalactite of drool stood upside down in the air, and his head hung off the bed.  His eyes belonged on ice at the super market.  They may as well have been a pair of yellow, lumpy grapes for all the life that they had in them.\\n\\n“He’s dead.”  Danielle cried.  I pulled him off the bed onto the floor.  It only took a second for me to consider what money he might have on him and reached into the pocket of his shorts to find a black leather wallet.  There were 250 dollars, so I took the two big bills and left the 50.\\n\\nDanielle called 911 like we should have the night before.  She said the operator said to give him mouth to mouth.  One look at his dead mouth and the thought of the stale air trapped in his lungs settled it in my mind that I was not giving him mouth to mouth.\\n\\n“I’m not giving him mouth to mouth!”\\n\\n“Come on, Riley!  Just try!  Is he cold?”\\n\\n“Not cold, but he’s not warm.  If you want to give him mouth to mouth get over here and do it.  Or they can come do it, but I AM NOT doing it!”\\n\\nShe talked into the phone.  “He’s not completely cold.  Is that a good thing?  Is there a chance he might live?”  She asked in tears and then turned to me.  “She says to put your mouth on his mouth and breath.”\\n\\n“Hang up!”\\n\\nWe gathered the syringes and cookers and balloons and threw the in the dumpster at the back of the parking lot.  We stepped outside as the fire truck pulled up.  They quickly gave up on trying to resuscitate Carl’s dead body.  One squad car pulled up, then another, and one more.  A cop put up the yellow tape around the room, and they separated Danielle and me, to question us.  She spoke so I could hear her, to get our stories to match up.  The black cop dressed in blues flirted with her.  She flirted back and told him she was a stripper.  As I wrote a statement on the hot hood of a running squad car in the sun, I wondered how many years I could get for it.  Would these be my last minutes of freedom scribbling and nervous on the hood of a cop car?\\n\\nAn unmarked car pulled up with two detectives.  They wore jackets, slacks and ties and had personality.  They slicked their black hair back true to their Hispanic heritage.  One of them talked to me about the Hornets and mentioned the Nuggets.  Sickly scents of pomade and cologne mixed with fear to turn my stomach.  His partner walked around and talked to the policemen before he walked up to me.\\n\\n“Look.  We got an overdose to go to right after this, two blocks away.  Another dead body.  We don’t have time for all of this.  Where are the syringes and cookers?  You don’t think he overdosed on air, do you? No.  We don’t either.  Now, we understand, you and your girlfriend got scared and hid all the stuff.  But we need some evidence of his drug use.  We need some syringes for evidence, and we’ll get you two on your way.  I promise.”\\n\\nThey took me to the dumpster where we tossed the stuff, and made me climb in, but I couldn’t find it.  There were several empty 20 oz. bottles from another room with syringes in them.  We never put our syringes in bottles like that, but the detective seemed satisfied.\\n\\n“OK.  Grab a few and give them to me.”\\n\\nThey took some pictures and got our written statements.  Things wrapped up, and the coroner came.  A hearse came to pick up the body.  It was obvious that one of the two men working for the company with the hearse enjoyed his job, maybe too much.  He had a black three-piece suit and a felt top hat on, with a gold chain to a watch in his breast pocket. He wore a monocle. I didn’t know hearses picked up overdosed bodies out of hotel rooms, but that’s what I saw that day.\\n\\nWhen they finally took the yellow police tape down and released us from the scene, she jumped into my arms and wrapped her legs around my waist.  We shouted in glee and relief and made out in front of the last two cops on the scene.  It was over, and we were free.  I still had the 200 hundred dollars.\\n\\nThe first thing we did was call Chivo and met one of his guys at a gas station.  When his driver showed up, I told him what happened.  It didn’t really matter to him.  They wanted the money.  At some point in the day, I spilled the last of our heroin out of a cooker onto my khaki pants.  She was mad, so we went to Home Depot.  I tried to steal a bunch of copper wire, but on the way out of the door, loss prevention drove me to the ground so hard the scab on my knee had fabric from my pants in it and turned it green.  Lock up smelled better than the last one, and they let me out after three days for petit theft.\\n\\nA week later, the coroner called to ask what I knew about Carl.  I told him what Carl told me, maybe it was true, maybe not, but it’s what he said.  His tone of voice seemed bewildered over the phone.  Sometime after that, on our way to Danielle’s first night stripping again, a strange figure riding a scooter pulled up next to us.  Danielle and I looked over at a 55-year-old lesbian in a black leather cap and vest, thick glasses, orang freckles and pale face.  Her hair was red and grey and buzzed off.  Could it be Carl? It looked exactly like him.  We laughed about when the 911 operator had instructed us to give him mouth to mouth.  \\n\\nI never felt much about robbing the dead man, or the fact that the last words he heard before he died were me telling him to, “shut the f*** up.”  There was no time to feel bad about it, when spilled hits of heroin and three days in jail were so disappointing.  The only thing I ever thought about it was that I should have robbed him when he was overdosed and called the paramedics.  It would have been less trouble for us.\\n\\n\n",

town, at one point, had a den of vampires. Not the immortal blood sucking kind, but all the same, it was a den of vampires in a house that sat on a particularly green plot of land on Upper Ranchitos past Carabajal. \\n\\nAnd the house that was there rested under beautiful tall trees, a sort of oasis or place of repose in the shade when the summer rolled around. The den had a mazelike quality, for it was obviously nothing more than the living room and bedroom and kitchen originally. Over the years, however, the old whitehaired woman who owned it had a greenhouse built on one year and another bedroom and kitchen at the other end of that greenhouse. After that she added several more bedrooms at random and in awkward places, so that then these extra domiciles were connected to the house by shoddily crafted and small, tunnel-like hallways. There were small portals you had stoop to pass through. Not one door inside matched any other, and toward the front of the house there was a steel spiked wall and another long-windowed gallery that created an abandoned courtyard of sorts. \\n\\nThere were piles of junk and old smoke colored tree limbs on the property in piles, but unlike the mesa or other places in the town, the rubbish there was charming. Things like old white bathtubs and the ornate carved backs of benches and antique wooden planks and wrought iron fencing or stone gargoyles stuck up out of the tall grass when I made my sweaty trek over there from the plaza or Walmart in the summertime.\\n\\nOne cold night in late October, after a warm wet shift of washing green chili chimichanga slop off of fiesta wear at Ogelvie’s, these two local junkies I knew ran up on me in the dark parking lot behind Bent Street and asked me to take them to the Vampire Den. It was an inconvenience, sure, but I knew they were going to cop something. And even though I wasn’t doing heroin yet, I wanted to be part of it, to get in with them and make any connection I could. That’s the first time I ever knew of the place. \\n\\nThe owner had something like eight dudes—all of them in their early 30s or late 20s—living there. They had taken to boarding in the cool rooms behind the kitchen or turned random benches in the odd corners into beds where they laid around like old Chinese men in black and white pictures of opium dens. None of them paid rent. They exploited the owner’s senility. Her mind was declining with her age, but she had money. So, they’d come up with some stupid chore to do and convince her to pay them way too much for doing it. Most of the time, they’d go cop and nod off in some other part of the house, never accomplishing whatever they were supposed to do. Later, they came down and offered the old lady their services, often times to complete the same chore. In this way, they were vampires, a den of them. \\n\\nAnd one time she shot both of her Great Danes in the head with her pistol. There was no good reason for it that anyone could see. Just her mind deteriorating. She paid some of the boys 60 bucks to bury them or cremate them. But I’m pretty sure, they dumped canine corpses somewhere in the desert and gave her two jars of ashes from the fire pit in the front yard to put up on the mantel. \\n\\nOut of the many young men who lived there, two of them were in a struggle for power. One (We’ll call him Blondie, because I don’t really remember his name and wouldn’t give it to you even if I did.) had long blond hair and lived in his own Fifth Wheel on the side and front of the property up by the road. He was known for dealing heroin out of it, until he shorted Diablo, couldn’t come up with the money and got trounced for it. \\n\\nAnother thing we knew Blondie for was his picking. He’d do this strange form of aerobics, bounce and sweat in the mirror of his Fifth Wheel after he got high. Wrapped a towel around his wrist and used his fingers to dig imaginary fibers he called staph out of his skin, until there was nothing but a giant black scab where his forehead used to be. Once he’d moved on and he was having to bum around town on people’s couches, other junkies would take the lightbulbs out of the bathroom to keep him from doing it. \\n\\nBlondie’s political enemy on the compound (Whom we’ll call Dufus, because why not?) shared the old lady’s bed, though it’s not clear what the nature of their relationship was. He sold for Diablo sometimes. Other times, he had Smokey and Des’s blacker gooier stuff in a big chunk at the round kitchen table and a scale in front of him. His hair was long. And he had a brother who wasn’t quite right, had to be led around this way and that way, had to be told to stop mindlessly repeating whatever random word he’d heard in someone else’s conversation. Dufus made candles for a living, before he started selling dope out of the old lady’s house.\\n\\nThe rest of them crept around in the dark. Never spoke as far as I can remember. And let Dufus and Blondie bicker over this or that, to vie for the attention and ultimately control of the old lady through their ruthless manipulations. They were the guys in town, at least when I first started doing heroin, again, unless you knew Smokey and Des. Because Diablo didn’t mess with the masses. He always chose one guy at a time and fronted him prepackaged bags of the stuff to sell, until they messed up his money and he’d beat them up. But Smokey and Des would come meet up with you anywhere south of the El Prado Post Office and north of Taco Bell, as long as you had their number and called between eight a.m. and six in the evening. \\n\\nEveryone in town met in the living room of the Vampire Den or Blondie’s fifth wheel at one point or another—or at least everyone in town with blood on their sleeves, who sweat through the rags they wore with black rings of grease around their collars and pinpricked pupils—so that everyone in the town who did dope knew everyone else who did it, too. It was inevitable that Wendy ended up there. Of course, she did. She was a girl. She got high. And that derelict compound is where the stuff was, back then. So, she slept in one of the back beds her first winter in town—this was before Bo came—and made kettle corn on the stove for Dufus in the afternoons. \\n\\nAnd the Vampire Den is where I first met Harold, Miss Ninny’s husband or boyfriend or whatever. He had come to pick up from Dufus, and we all stood around in the living room there. A tiny, black-haired girl waited next to Harold in her school uniform. She had one foot on the ground and the other one moving up and down along the inside of her opposite leg, like she was nervous. He said she was his daughter, even though she was Miss Ninny’s daughter, and I guessed her age. I said maybe 7, but probably 8. Harold and the girl smiled, because it was so. \\n\\nAnd while we talked, I found out he and I were from the same part of the country. He was born in Port Orchard and handled snakes while he grew up out there and had firm beliefs about the superiority of white people over all the other races, citing differences in sebaceous glands and some other things I can’t remember to prove the point. How that worked? I wasn’t sure, but Harold went on like no one wouldn’t agree. All the while, the little girl clung to the armchair next to him and looked up from his hip taking it all in through those big black pupils. \\n\\nAnd I saw Harold around town sometimes, like the time he was down at AutoZone with Miss Ninny in the summer. They’d walked all the way up from Talpa that evening, because their metallic forest green Trailblazer had broken down. She was asking him for a cigarette, one she’d almost certainly purchased but which he guarded and doled out to her at his discretion. She looked completely out of place. Miss Ninny was sweating and desperate and frail, intrinsically feeble in a way that we were not. Looked to be 40ish. Had long skinny appendages that stuck out of her sagging torso and squatty palms with long slender fingers and bulbous tips like a tree frog’s hands. Her shape and skin were too soft and voice too perfect and creamy to be there waiting for Bo to show up like the rest of us, much less to have walked there. It embarrassed me to see her, not that I knew Miss Ninny then. It would be a long time, before our paths crossed and we spent any significant time together.\\n\\nIn the meantime, back at the Vampires’ Den, things changed. Snow fell. Snow melted. Birds sang in the trees. Bonfires burned in the back yard, and soon, Dufus and his brother left in the middle of the night. Nobody heard they were leaving, and no one knew where they went. Blondie became the prime minister of the property. Earned enmity with the old lady’s son, although it’s not clear that the son’s motives were any less self-serving than Blondie’s. Her son wanted the property and made it plain, and eventually, Blondie lost his place and power there, too. \\n\\nThe old lady had his Fifth Wheel towed out to the nether reaches of the northern mountains or wherever. He could be seen around town leeching off of this pretty middle-aged red head and driving her Nissan Xterra. The black oozing sore that was his forehead never went away. It only changed shape and grew up past his hairline. And pretty soon, Bo and Wendy took over working for Diablo. Some months after that, they moved into one of the back rooms together. By then, all the rest of the vampires had left.\n",

                                                  \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nIt is a lesser known fact—maybe even completely unknown—that our town, at one point, had a den of vampires. Not the immortal blood sucking kind, but all the same, it was a den of vampires in a house that sat on a particularly green plot of land north of the plaza.\\n\\nAnd the house that was there rested under beautiful tall trees, a sort of oasis or place of repose in the shade when the summer rolled around. The den had a mazelike quality, for it was obviously nothing more than the living room and bedroom and kitchen originally. Over the years, however, the old whitehaired woman who owned it had a greenhouse built on one year and another bedroom and kitchen at the other end of that greenhouse. After that she added several more bedrooms at random and in awkward places, so that then these extra domiciles were connected to the house by shoddily crafted and small, tunnel-like hallways. There were small portals you had stoop to pass through. Not one door inside matched any other, and toward the front of the house there was a steel spiked wall and another long-windowed gallery that created an abandoned courtyard of sorts. \\n\\nThere were piles of junk and old smoke colored tree limbs on the property in piles, but unlike the mesa or other places in town, the rubbish there was charming. Things like old white bathtubs and the ornate carved backs of benches and antique wooden planks and wrought iron fencing or stone gargoyles stuck up out of the tall grass when I made my sweaty trek over there from the plaza or Walmart in the summertime.\\n\\nOne cold night in late October, after a warm wet shift of washing green chili chimichanga slop off of fiesta wear at Ogelvie’s, these two local junkies I knew ran up on me in the dark parking lot behind the alley and asked me to take them to the Vampire Den. It was an inconvenience, but I knew they were going to cop something, even though I wasn’t doing heroin yet, and I wanted to be part of it, to know them and make any connection I could. That’s the first time I ever knew of the place.   \\n\\nThe owner had something like eight dudes—all of them in their early 30s or late 20s—living there. They had taken to boarding in the cool rooms behind the kitchen or turned random benches in the odd corners into beds where they laid around like old Chinese men in black and white pictures of opium dens. None of them paid rent. They exploited the owner’s senility. Her mind was declining with her age, but she had money. So, they’d come up with some stupid chore to do and convince her to pay them way too much for doing it. Most of the time, they’d go cop and nod off in some other part of the house, never accomplishing whatever they were supposed to do. Later, they came down and offered the old lady their services, often times to complete the same chore. In this way, they were vampires, a den of them. \\n\\nAnd one time she shot both of her Great Danes in the head with her pistol. There was no good reason for it that anyone could see. Just her mind deteriorating. She paid some of the boys 60 bucks to bury them or cremate them. But I’m pretty sure, they dumped canine corpses somewhere in the desert and gave her two jars of ashes from the fire pit in the front yard to put up on the mantel. \\n\\nOut of the many young men who lived there, two of them were in a struggle for power. One (We’ll call him Blondie, because I don’t really remember his name and wouldn’t give it to you even if I did.) had long blond hair and lived in his own Fifth Wheel on the side and front of the property up by the road. He was known for dealing heroin out of it, until he shorted Diablo, couldn’t come up with the money and got trounced for it. \\n\\nAnother thing we knew Blondie for was his picking. He’d do this strange form of aerobics, bounce and sweat in the mirror of his Fifth Wheel after he got high. Wrapped a towel around his wrist and used his fingers to dig imaginary fibers he called staph out of his skin, until there was nothing but a giant black scab where his forehead used to be. Once he’d moved on and he was having to bum around town on people’s couches, other junkies would take the lightbulbs out of the bathroom to keep him from doing it.  \\n\\nBlondie’s political enemy on the compound (Whom we’ll call Dufus, because why not?) shared the old lady’s bed, though it’s not clear what the nature of their relationship was. He sold for Diablo sometimes. Other times, he had Smokey and Des’s blacker gooier stuff in a big chunk at the round kitchen table and a scale in front of him. His hair was long. And he had a brother who wasn’t quite right, had to be led around this way and that way, had to be told to stop mindlessly repeating whatever random word he’d heard in someone else’s conversation. Dufus made candles for a living, before he started selling dope out of the old lady’s house.\\n\\nThe rest of them crept around in the dark. Never spoke as far as I can remember. And let Dufus and Blondie bicker over this or that, to vie for the attention and ultimately control of the old lady through their ruthless manipulations. They were the guys in town, at least when I first started doing heroin, again, unless you knew Smokey and Des. Because Diablo didn’t mess with the masses. He always chose one guy at a time and fronted him prepackaged bags of the stuff to sell, until they messed up his money and he’d beat them up. But Smokey and Des would come meet up with you anywhere south of the Post Office and north of Taco Bell, as long as you had their number and called between eight a.m. and six in the evening. \\n\\nEveryone in town met there at one point or another—or at least everyone in town with blood on their sleeves, who sweat through the rags they wore with black rings of grease around their collars and pinpricked pupils—so that everyone in town who did dope knew everyone else who did it, too. It was inevitable that Wendy ended up there. Of course, she did. She was a girl. She got high. And that derelict compound is where the stuff was, back then. So, she slept in one of the back beds her first winter in town—this was before Bo came—and made kettle corn on the stove for Dufus in the afternoons. \\n\\nAnd the Vampire Den is where I first met Harold, Miss Ninny’s husband or boyfriend or whatever. He had come to pick up from Dufus, and we all stood around in the living room there. A tiny, black haired girl waited next to Harold in her school uniform. She had one foot on the ground and the other one moving up and down along the inside of her opposite leg, like she was nervous. He said she was his daughter, even though she was Miss Ninny’s daughter, and I guessed her age. I said maybe 7, but probably 8. Harold and the girl smiled, because it was so. \\n\\nAnd while we talked, I found out he and I were from the same part of the country. He was born in Louisiana and handled snakes while he grew up out there and had firm beliefs about the superiority of white people over all the other races, citing differences in sebaceous glands and some other things I can’t remember to prove the point. How that worked? I wasn’t sure, but Harold went on like no one wouldn’t agree. All the while, the little girl clung to the armchair next to him and looked up from his hip taking it all in through those big black pupils.  \\n\\nAnd I saw Harold around town sometimes, like the time he was down at AutoZone with Miss Ninny in the summer. They’d walked all the way  because their metallic forest green Trailblazer had broken down. She was asking him for a cigarette, one she’d almost certainly purchased but which he guarded and doled out to her at his discretion. She looked completely out of place. Miss Ninny was sweating and desperate and frail, intrinsically feeble in a way that we were not. Looked to be 40ish. Had long skinny appendages that stuck out of her sagging torso and squatty palms with long slender fingers and bulbous tips like a tree frog’s hands. Her shape and skin were too soft and creamy voice too perfect to be there waiting for Bo to show up like the rest of us, much less to have walked there. It embarrassed me to see her, not that I knew Miss Ninny then. It would be a long time, before our paths crossed and we spent any significant time together.\\n\\nIn the meantime, back at the Vampires’ Den, things changed. Snow fell. Snow melted. Birds sang in the trees. Bonfires burned in the back yard, and soon, Dufus and his brother left in the middle of the night. Nobody heard they were leaving, and no one knew where they went. Blondie became the prime minister of the property. Earned enmity with the old lady’s son, although it’s not clear that the son’s motives were any less self-serving than Blondie’s. Her son wanted the property and made it plain, and eventually, Blondie lost his place and power there, too. \\n\\nThe old lady had his Fifth Wheel towed out to the nether reaches of wherever. He could be seen around town leeching off of this pretty middle-aged red head and driving her Nissan Xterra. The black oozing sore that was his forehead never went away. It only changed shape and grew up past his hairline. And pretty soon, Bo and Wendy took over working for Diablo. Some months after that, they moved into one of the back rooms together. By then, all the rest of the vampires had left.\n",

space in West Virginia.\\n\\nI don’t know if that’s true.\\n\\nBut I heard it somewhere.\\n\\nAnd that’s not the kind of freezer space they use for food.\\n\\nThe mothers. The fathers. The children.\\n\\nThe coffin and cremation industries are booming in West Virginia.\\n\\nBut it’s not just there. It’s in Ohio.\\n\\nMy ex-girlfriend died there. It's where she was from. Left behind her 4-year-old son. One of my other friends moved back home to Ohio after staying sober for 18 months. Went down to his old room in the basement and never walked back out. The nicest kid you ever met. Really was. Wore cowboy boots. And liked to tell jokes. His parents buried him that Friday.\\n\\nBut it’s not just in Ohio.\\n\\nIt’s in Washington State, too.\\n\\nAnd New Mexico. Where everyone I know is either sober, dead or in prison. And I’d guess that a third of them are dead. A few of them are still running around, but I can’t think of who.\\n\\nThe disease needs new flesh. The plague eats new faces. The beast is hungry and we are perishing.\\n\\nThey say there’s no more freezer space in West Virginia.\\n\\nAnd they’ve got the kind of giant portable freezers FEMA uses for natural disasters.\\n\\nBut I don’t know if that’s true.\\n\\nI just heard it somewhere.\\n\\nAnd now I stand under the tree behind the garage.\\n\\nMosquitoes in the trashcan.Soggy weeds growing in the ditch.\\n\\nNext to the woodpile.\\n\\nI think about new year’s morning.\\n\\nI was 6. You were 5.\\n\\nWe were popping fire crackers and a black cat blew up in your hand.\\n\\nYou ran in. Momma held a wet rag on it. And you quit crying.\\n\\nBut everything changes. You did.\\n\\nStarted sneaking out. Lost weight. Stole my coin collection and Dad’s tools.\\n\\nRan off with Ray Ray and a dude named Ron. Come back with long sleeves and a black eye.\\n\\nYou lost more weight. You lost your teeth.\\n\\nAnd told me you were going to get better. That this was just a passing phase.\\n\\nWell it passed. And you’re still my sister. On either side of the ground.\\n\\nI love you. And miss you and wish you’d never left\\n\\nThey say there’s no more freezer space in West Virginia.\\n\\nBut I don’t know about that.\\n\\nIt’s just something I heard.\n",

Even when those places are where my life’s been hardest and terrible things have happened. But maybe that’s what makes them so familiar. Nothing forges intimacy like suffering with another, and that’s how it was with the city. I suffered, and she knew me. \\n\\nI walked her streets till everyone knew me, and no one liked me. Maybe, it was what I did, because I was dying and wanted everyone to see, wanted them all to know. Wanted to show them, the best way I could, the festering scar in my brain, the one that came before all the rest, the scar of scars, mine. Showing them my death, baring it all like that in the streets for them to see, comforted me, somehow. It quelled my brain, the beast. \\n\\nIn the mornings, I made phone calls looking for death. Sometimes, I used the payphones in the plaza. Mostly, though, I used the landline at a café down the street. Once someone answered and agreed to deliver, I sat on the railroad ties in the dirt of the municipal parking lot or at the picnic tables outside of Albertson’s to wait for it. And once it was in my sweaty hand, I tasted it in the bathroom stall. \\n\\nAfter that, there was stumbling through town with the hiccups, a slink in my step and mischief in my eyes that hadn’t been there before. I became something else for the second parts of those days, something malevolent, death’s own body and comfortable in my skin.\n",

neck belong to her. Two cigarette burns, perfectly round and white, sit two inches below my ears where Frankenstein’s creature had his bolts. I see them every time I shave, and they remind me of hard days with my girl. Her name was Danielle, but I just called her baby.In the middle of our arguments we screamed in one another’s faces. Sometimes, I cleared my throat and hawked phlegm into her eyes, and she spat back into mine. We tried to blow each other away with the spray of verbal buckshot until there was nothing left of us. Ten minutes later we made love on the bed or the back seat of the Camry and found something or someone to rob. It was a game we played, and it was killing both of us.\\n\\nThe first time I met her, her boyfriend lay on the floor of my apartment trembling and bleeding through his pants. My drug dealers pulled him out of her Camry on the south side of town and stabbed him in the knee for trying to go around me and deal with them directly. It didn’t work out for him, thus the crying and bleeding on my floor.\\n\\n“Hi.”\\n\\n“Hi.”\\n\\n“Are you Riley?”\\n\\n“Yes. You must be Danielle.”\\n\\n“Sure am.” She dropped his head to put her hand out.\\n\\n“Good to finally meet you.” I smiled and pinched her fingers.\\n\\nI was seeing a different girl at the time, a 19-year-old red head who liked to smoke her dope and tell me she was on her way over hours before she left her house, but that morning in my apartment, the look in Danielle’s eye told me it was only a matter of time before we got together. Never mind Mike and the red head.\\n\\nDanielle and Mike used to come over every day before three to laugh at me for nodding out and looking like Teen Wolf. She always tried to get alone with me, but we didn’t hook up until after Mike started beating her again and I spent two weeks locked up, promising myself and everyone else that I would never do heroin again.\\n\\nMike took the battery out of her car and held her against her will in a trailer on the Mesa while I sat in jail. Then he passed out one afternoon after he put the battery back in, and she made her escape. Half an hour later, I called her from the payphone outside of the jail, and our reign of terror began.\\n\\nI should tell you that this is the part of the story where you might want to stop reading. On the next page or so, I’m going to sell a guy a bag of dirt for 40 dollars and turn his face into hamburger meat before I hold him hostage in his bedroom for the night. My girlfriend will beg me to infect her with the Hepatitis C virus, and I will try. A few pages after that, I will rob a dead man, so if you’re not with all that or don’t understand that we were in a bad way, this is a good time to stop reading.\\n\\nOne of the only three heroin dealers in town fronted us packages of dope, and we came back with the money every night. He fronted us more, and we returned with more cash. Then he gave us a half-ounce, but we never came back. He offered anyone in town a 50-dollar bag for our whereabouts and left promises to murder me on her voicemail. We ripped off other junkies. They hated us. We stole merchandise and food from businesses. The owners and employees hated us. Several cops in town knew that I was driving the Camry and that I had a girlfriend. They hated us too, but we hated each other most of all.\\n\\nDanielle had a monthly prescription for 90 Colonopin and a SSI check. Both were available on the first of the month, and we shot so much dope and took so many pills the first week of the month that our only friend quit hanging out with us. When her orange pill bottle quit rattling and the check was spent, anxiety wrought havoc. More than once she left me at the gas station and freezing at three in the morning while I was buying cigarettes and drove by a few times, screaming and giving me the finger for no reason. Later in the night we would go to the ER looking for meds.\\n\\nHer Camry became our home. We cleaned out the ashtray at the casino several times a day and listened to Depeche Mode and Seminole Wind by John Anderson. Our diet consisted entirely of Wendy’s spicy chicken nuggets and Baja Blast. She made me give her a shot of dope visibly mixed with my own blood to intentionally contract Hepatitis C. That way I could no longer use contamination as an excuse for why I wouldn’t share a hit or a rinse with her. One afternoon I pulled over on the side of the highway and proposed to her with her own wooden ring. She said yes and we made out like two outlaws in love.\\n\\nA lot of guys liked her. One of them lived in a nice apartment his parents paid for. His name was Justin. Now I forget what he said, but it made me mad. Then he gave us 40 bucks to go score, so she and I split it between us and put dirt in his bag. He called to complain, but we quit answering the phone. Later that night, I decided we should sleep at his place, so I parked in his parking lot and told her,\\n\\n“Get all of our blankets and meet me at the front door, baby.”\\n\\nAs I walked through the cobblestone courtyard of the adobe apartment complex, I wondered how mad he was and thought of what I was about to do. I fingered the baggie in my pocket. At his front door breath billowed out of my mouth, and the raps of my knuckles on his door bit cold into my bones. I put my hand back into my pocket and waited. The television played on the other side of the door. He opened it, but the chain only allowed a few inches.\\n\\n“Who is that? Riley? What do you want? I ought to mess you up for selling me dirt! Get out of here!” The interior light of his apartment poured out yellow through the crack in the door. It looked warm and comfortable.\\n\\n“I know. I know. Listen. I got something here, to make up for it.” I moved my arm and hand in my pocket, to indicate it was in my pocket. “Open up, so I can show you.”\\n\\n“Ok.” The door closed momentarily while the chain latch came off. The knob turned. I grabbed it and lodged myself in the doorframe so he couldn’t close it. “What are you doing? You can’t stay here! Why does she have blankets? Dude, what the f\\*\\*\\*? Seriously?” A pile of blankets with Danielle’s legs bounced through the courtyard towards us. I made sure she got in before I let him shut the door.\\n\\nShe threw the blankets on the shag rug in front of his TV. He whined in the kitchen and flapped his arms, but we disregarded him until we had settled in and felt ready to address him. His accusations were mostly accurate, except when he said we didn’t have any heroin. We did, but not for him.\\n\\nAfter she and I situated things, I showed him the 20-dollar bag we had. It was enough to shut him up, because we promised to share. We told him we would split it three ways, but in the bathroom, she and I split it down the middle. Afterwards, we rinsed the spoon and cotton filter a few more times, until all that was left was dirt and ash in the spoon. Then we sucked it up and came out of the bathroom to give it to him. He happily took the syringe full of dirty water and never accused us of anything until we hid ourselves in the bathroom again.\\n\\nDanielle had her pants down, and I sat on the toilet applying cortisone cream to a patch of eczema on her rear end and thigh. She leaned over the sink. The door was locked while I took care of my baby.\\n\\n“Open up. I know you’re in there doing more! Open up! You pieces of s\\*\\*\\*!” The door shook as he pounded. “Open up! Open the f\\*\\*\\*ing door!” The door hit her in the head when he kicked it in.\\n\\nMy hands ripped the cedar towel rack out of the wall, before I could think. I beat him back out of the bathroom and side-to-side, across the living room with the wooden rod. A symphony of rage blared out of me and into my opponent. High notes of great satisfaction created melodies of glee as I continued to dominate. I was the impassioned composer of a brutal work, wildly conducting an orchestra of fingers, fists and arms. He tripped and fell backwards over his coffee table and couch.\\n\\nMy shirt was off and sweat was dripping when I threw the rod at his face. He could have it, because I owned him now. I leapt onto his chest for the crescendo of my opus and went to work. I pinned his arms under my legs. Bare knuckles bloodied themselves on his cheeks, and his face turned side to side with each punch. Snot and blood leaked from his mouth and nose, and he squealed as I stopped to catch my breath.\\n\\n“Please, stop! Please! Please!” My teeth bit into my bottom lip. I looked at him for a second with my fist cocked back, before I tried to drive it through the back of his skull. His face was swollen and discolored and bloody.\\n\\n“That’s what you get for messing with my girl.” I thought and jumped up to grab the biggest butcher knife in the kitchen. About 10 inches of blade shined in the living room light.\\n\\n“I will f***ing kill you! You piece of s***! I will f***ing gut you! You f***ing hear me?” The F word constituted about one of every ten of my words back then! “Get in your room and give me your cell phone! You can come out in the morning, when she and I are done. You hear me, you f***ing piece of s***? Come out of the room, and I will stick this f***ing knife in your throat! Your guts will be all over this f***ing floor! You f\\*\\*\\*ing hear me?”\\n\\nHe didn’t say anything. He gave me his phone and held his face as he walked into his room. People around town always told me that he was a fighter. Supposedly he stood up to Diablo once and even “gave him a run for his money.” Everyone always said he was tough, but not that night.\\n\\nDanielle and I made a bed on the floor out of our blankets. She pulled up some pornography on his phone. Whatever meth we did the day before was too strong and the heroin was too weak to get us to sleep, so we had sex on and off throughout the night. Sometimes, I smoked cigarettes and tried to write poetry on pieces of cardboard box. She played dress up with some clothes that she had brought in. Later in the night she said something that hurt my feelings, so I used the scissors in my hand to stab myself in the leg a few times, but as daylight broke there was forgiveness and more sex. We defiled his toothbrush before we left, but I can’t remember why.\n",

Danielle blubbered all over herself and rambled through feigned tears and dramatic sobs to patrons coming in and out of the store. She had some sad story to tell them, but no one cared. The meth and lack of sleep corroded the circuitry in our brains that helped us remember to not act like drug addicts. It wasn’t long before six squad cars pulled up.\\n\\n“So I’m not going to find any drugs at all in the car, if I search it right now? Are you sure?”\\n\\n“Absolutely, Officer. We don’t even do drugs! What is this all about? I don’t understand why we are being searched.” I was appalled. Danielle sat to my left on the hood of the cop car.\\n\\n“Well, we got a call about you. We are doing our jobs. I’m going to search the car. Do I have permission?”\\n\\n“Of course. We have nothing to hide.”\\n\\n“And, we won’t find anything? I want to make sure. If there is anything in the car, we will find it and you’ll go to jail.”\\n\\n“Nothing. We don’t even do drugs, like I said. You can search it. Call the dogs, for all I care. There are NO DRUGS in that car, whatsoever! GO AHEAD! Waste your time if you want.  I don’t care.”\\n\\nWithin 30 seconds, one officer held two syringes high above his head in the air like a proud cat with a dead mouse. Other officers continued to search the vehicle. I finally quit lying about it and took the charges for both of us. If I confessed my guilt, they would let her go to avoid paperwork. There was a chance she could get me out.\\n\\n“Those are mine. Anything you find in that car is mine. She didn’t know anything about it.”\\n\\n“Oh. Really? Are you sure about that?”\\n\\n“She has nothing to do with it. She doesn’t even do drugs. Those are mine, and anything else you find. She doesn’t do drugs.”\\n\\n“She doesn’t even do drugs, huh? That makes sense. A second ago, you didn’t do drugs either.” The officer smiled at how stupid the whole thing was, and my face admitted that it was.\\n\\n“No sir.” A syringe slipped out of Danielle’s underwear and down her pants leg onto the pavement right in front of the cop. “That’s mine, too!”\\n\\n“Oh, really? That’s yours too, huh?”\\n\\n“Yes. Like I said, Officer, she doesn’t do drugs.” He smiled at me.\\n\\nThey hauled me off handcuffed in the back of the squad car, and she stayed with the Camry. I insisted on getting medical attention before I was booked into jail. The doctor hated junkies like me and was extremely rude. He only offered blood pressure medicine, and I called him a, “f\\*cking b\\*tch,” to show my gratitude. The officer who transported me to the jail made friendly small talk. Country music twanged on the radio, and he turned it up for me. It was about 7 a.m. when he dropped me off at booking.\\n\\nA lady nurse frowned as she tried to take my blood pressure and check me medically for admittance into general population.\\n\\n“HOLD STILL! I’m trying to get your pressure! HOLD STILL!!!”\\n\\n“I am. I am. I haven’t moved a bit. What are you talking about?”\\n\\n“I’m talking about you shaking like a leaf! STOP IT, NOW! I’m so tired of this, sh\\*t!” She finally got a decent reading and took the cuff off my arm. She sighed. “Do you want to hurt yourself? Do you feel suicidal?”\\n\\nI looked her dead in the eyes. She was a rude lady. “I’m homicidal, b\\*tch!”\\n\\nThe observation tank is where potentially psychotic and suicidal inmates like I was are observed. Bright fluorescent bulbs buzzed all day and night in the cold cell. Through the large window inmates and guards of both sexes laughed at my naked body. They fed me the cold rejects of yesterday’s dinner on a Styrofoam tray, so I didn’t use a plastic one to beat myself to death. I had a blanket and a turtle suit, which has two Velcro straps for the shoulders and enough fabric to cover the front and hind quarters, but I was too psychotic to wear it.\\n\\nWhen I first arrived, I was ornery and miserable and offensive as usual, coming down from a long time of not sleeping because of the meth. Sure, but not psychotic, not yet. When they put me in a cell where the lights never turned off and kept me on display like some savage beast for all to see and laugh at, I lost my mind completely.  Male and female inmates pointed and laughed at my naked body standing and lost in the middle of the cell. The guards taunted me and cursed me out through the glass window every night.\\n\\nMy mind played terrible tricks on me. Danielle had made her way into the jail, but now I hallucinated that she was at a music festival in a park down the hall with these two elfish twins, a boy and girl. They took Ecstasy and bought McDonald’s after they came down and the show was over. I watched through the feed slot in my door. Later the guards passed my girlfriend around in a broom closet like she was a rag doll. I screamed with fierce intensity for the number of hours only the mentally deranged can. I screamed till it felt like I had swallowed chunks of glass.\\n\\nThen the jail turned into a garage, where Danielle got into her car with the twins. They took her from me. I screamed into where the door went into the wall. Danielle was in the room with me, talking to me, telling me she had to go with them. Then, she turned into my blanket and was gone. I screamed at the wall and door.\\n\\nTwo black guards ran a sex ring out of the showers. They offered the sexual services of inmates, male or female, in a steamy sauna for a decent price and threw in a fully loaded meth pipe for free. Danielle was prostituted but they kept her in a bucket of ice, until Dustin showed up. She loved Dustin. He had what she wanted. I screamed. My mattress was full of sex toys, and I tried to get them out to throw them into the hallway. When the black guard came to check on me, I pretended I was sleeping.\\n\\nI had a conversation with an older Mexican gentleman, who sat on the partition between the toilet and the rest of the cell. We talked for a couple of hours at least. Mostly I talked. I looked back at him, to get a response, but there was only an empty carton of chocolate milk on the partition.\\n\\nIn the mirror, I found a piece of black tar heroin pressed up into the crack around it.  I scraped it off with a plastic fork into a paper cup and mixed it with water. I hovered over it, on the toilet, trying to hide it from the guards. They regularly barked threats and insults through the window. After the heroin mixed sufficiently with the water, I lifted it to my face to snort it. The unmistakable stink of another person’s feces filled my nostrils. I threw it away, but that’s what people do in cells like that. They throw their feces at the walls and windows.\\n\\nThere was an emergency button on the intercom system, which I was not supposed to press. A young nurse with dark skin, black hair and blue eyes was on the other side of it. I hoped she would help me, but she told me repeatedly to stop pressing the button. “DO NOT PRESS IT AGAIN!” I pressed it again. The two black guards opened the door, “Put your hands on the wall. It’s okay. We are here to help.” They ripped me out of the cell by the hair and a foot and dragged my shriveled, naked body down the hall, upside down. The pretty nurse laughed.\\n\\nThey put me in the hole, and from inside of it I heard crazy conversations. A woman and the cops.\\n\\n“Oh yeah, I told him to go to little league. You know he loves it.”\\n\\n“Yes, ma’am. We are sure he does. Now how are we going to drain this abscess on your arm?”\\n\\n“Oh. Let me sit in the chair, or lie down on the table? I don’t know. Y’all are the experts. Tommy is at little league practice. I don’t want him to know about this.”\\n\\n“Don’t worry, ma’am. We’ll have you all fixed up in a minute.”\\n\\nThen, someone had me in their crosshairs, someone with an automatic rifle. I danced in place and screamed in the hole. If I kept my feet off the ground, they couldn’t shoot me through the crack under the door. I screamed for my life, “THEY ARE GOING TO SHOOT ME!!!! HELP!!! HELP!!!! HELP!!!”\\n\\nHours of screaming passed before the voices of officers told me to get on the ground. I did. When the door opened, they asked me, “Do you see that red dot? We will tase you. Do not do anything stupid.” They put me in the happy chair, which is a wheelchair without the front two wheels and an excessive number of Velcro pieces to strap lunatics down. I struggled for hours after they put me into it. I passed out from exhaustion for a few moments, before they came to tighten them again. They took me to video court, and I fell naked in front of the other inmates and screamed and cried. When they put me back in the hole, I defecated on the floor.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\n\\nThe bus ride back to my apartment is nice.\\n\\nIt’s funny that I don’t have to take the bus back from the motel anymore. Cab fare’s nothing. But I do, because I like it. A few sober and empty moments in the middle of my day. It’s peaceful and gives me time to think, not that I need any more time to think than I’ve already got, but it lets me relax in a way that’s impossible at the apartment or the trap motel. No one can get at me here. I usually turn my phone off on the bus and stare out the window and think.\\n\\nTime for thinking about whatever I want. This or that or teratoma tumors. Those are the ones that grow hair and teeth and veins and even eyeballs, sometimes. I mean, they can pretty much grow anything that the body grows. Crude and monstrous attempts at the different tissues and organs and whatever else which is kind of stomach turning really, if you’ve ever seen it. Sometimes they even have snarling lips and eyes in snaggletooth faces. It’s horrifying. Like the soul of some black and fugitive being seeking to physically form itself in the meat of an unsuspecting person’s body. And then, there are some women who think they’re actually pregnant with child. Carry it for weeks, months even, believing in, planning for and even singing to their unborn human only to find out it’s not a child at all but another kind of tumor. What they call a molar pregnancy, and after some chemotherapy and radiation or whatever’s prescribed, the unfortunate woman births the mass in a splatter of blood and some other fluids, usually into a toilet.\\n\\nAnd so, I’m wondering about all of it. Tumors. Children. And everything else that was once nothing and became something. How does the woman who finds out her child is actually no child at all feel about it? Does she grieve the loss of what never really was in the first place? Because, at least for me, far too often it’s not any actual thing I ever find myself mourning the loss of. And I think too often we mourn, find ourselves pining for a thing we’ve made and that exists only in our minds.\\n\\nThe way things went with Leticia is kind of like that for me. You know, it’s not like we were married. It’s not like we even knew each other that well or even spent any real significant time together. Mostly my feelings for her were centered around some imaginary conception of who she was and what things would maybe be like for us one day. None of that was the girl. That wasn’t the relationship. But thinking back, I’m not really sure what that future was supposed to be. And once the thing happened there on the couch last night or this morning, whenever it was, it turned out to be no good.\\n\\nShe trusted me. And it was a surprise to me, but when I found out that I was still capable of having hopes and dream—or what I thought were hopes and dreams, I let her carry them. She was my vessel. And the affection between us existed as a sort of shared faith we kept. Faith in an abstract and mysterious, yet somehow sublime future for the two of us, like an unborn child we sang to and painted the walls pink for and for whom we joyfully and patiently waited. Only to find a bleeding and malignant mass at its delivery.\\n\\nAnd I have myself to blame. I always do. But now my mistakes, the mistake of shooting her up and letting her give herself to me like that, the lies and everything else, formed themselves in my life. For a brief moment they showed themselves, and now it’s all floating away from me, a cold dead meat tumor with strange hair and teeth floating away from me. So that I can never get it back. So that I can never fix it.\\n\\nAnd I’m not sure that I even want to at this point, but now, I’m standing up and walking to the front of the bus and hanging onto the railing there. The bus comes to a halt and lowers briefly with that loud whoosh of air, and I get out. There’s a scrawny silver haired lady in white pajama pants that are printed with pink elephants and made of thin flannel digging in the trashcan. The cold sidewalk water saturates the bottoms of her pants so completely that the grey dinge is actually climbing the fabric. The fabric is dirty and sopping wet all the way up to her knees, and now, her face shines as she holds whatever she found in the waste above her head like some sort of national treasure, the jeweled crown or king’s chalice or Excalibur or something like that. But it’s just a donut. A stale, soggy donut that she found in the trashcan, and her delusion continues as I pass her.\\n\\nShortly after that, two immigrant men walk by me. One has his son on his shoulders and they’re laughing to each other in another language, revealing straight teeth and the pink tongues in their big open mouths. A girl in her mid-twenties sits on a milk crate in an alley between buildings and is smoking a cigarette. The vents above her head blow out the smoke of cooked animal fat into the street. And another block down, I come upon another woman who wears a trench coat and moves like an orangutan. Long legs and long arms. A small sprinkle of rain is falling from the sky, and she has stopped beneath a tree with one of those metal carts that you pull instead of push, sort of like a hand truck for older people with a cage to hold all of their groceries or whatever, and all these clear plastic bags of other bags that are full of trash fill the cart. It’s mostly white paper inside of the bags. And she’s looking at it and tending to it and moving it all around and making sure it’s all there with so much care and concern. It's like maybe her dog or own daughter melted into pile of scraps out of the blue one day, and she’s been carrying them all around since, hoping that by some magical spell or some other yet unknown mechanism or unnamed process they might be put back together again and her loss restored. But not today. The interested black eyes of a Hispanic girl are staring and walking past, and so, I move on myself.\\n\\nAnd caddy corner to my apartment window, the same friendly and giant vagrant stands there with his cardboard sign, and so, I’m looking at him, and he doesn’t talk. His face is wrinkled and flaky with dry skin and scabbed around the nose. And I pull out a few bills and give them to him. He doesn’t even grunt. Just takes it, and when I look at his sign, it doesn’t say anything which makes me laugh as I step off the curb and across the street and get upstairs to my apartment.\\n\\nAs soon as I open my door, I know she’s not there. Not because I don’t see her, but because I don’t feel her. She’s gone. And in a way, I don’t really mind not having her here right now, not because I don’t want to see her or don’t appreciate her or anything like that. It’s nothing like that at all. It’s just that I wouldn’t be able to look at her without looking at all of my failures and my recklessness concerning her and her life or my ingratitude for what she shared with me. I wouldn’t be able to look at her without seeing my reflection in her eyes and all of the pain I’ve caused, and I don’t want to look at all of that right now. Her absence is welcome. It doesn’t bother me. So, I sit down and reach underneath the couch and pull out my Altoids container and the spoon and a fresh needle and do the thing.\\n\\nAnd I wake up in the dark. And look at my phone. It’s after midnight, and there are several missed calls from Sharky and one from an unknown number, and then, there are some text messages from different people and one from Leticia. So, I open it.\\n\\nIt says:\\n\\nI want a reason to believe in you.\\n\\nOr us.\\n\\nThere aren’t any.\\n\\nAll I can think about now is every time I told you that I loved you\\n\\nAnd you never said it back.\\n\\nDon’t call. Don’t text. Don’t come by.\\n\\nTake care of yourself, Randy.\\n\\nAnd it’s hard to describe exactly what it’s like to read that. It hurts. Obviously. But there’s more to it than that because my heart is beating so fast that I can’t even breathe and then I have to pee, so I walk to the bathroom and stare at the toilet and shake and can’t pee at all, because my knees are all wobbly, and I’m thinking too hard. It’s like there’s a hot acid burning up out of my chest onto the back of my neck and ears, and the blood has all left my stomach so that I’m sort of sick. My hands grab the top of my skull, and the middle finger is digging into one side while the thumb is digging into the opposite temple. My throat tightens and chest heaves. And I turn a circle there in the bathroom, and now my hands are groping at my stomach, and I’m pacing into the living room and grabbing the phone and trying to call her, but that awful tone comes over the phone and says the wireless user is not available and has not set up any kind of voicemail for me to leave a message. And I try to call back, but my phone falls into the toilet, so I pull it out really quickly and drop it on the rug.\\n\\nAnd now, my chest is expanding and collapsing, and I’m grabbing the rod for the shower curtain which slips from between the walls, and I fall slowly, pathetically into the empty bathtub, wrapped in the plastic sheet and my heart is beating and my chest is expanding bigger and bigger. My ears are kind of ringing, because I can’t believe it, and I’m trying to breathe.\\n\\nI’m just trying to breathe, now.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nBut, it passes pretty quickly.\\n\\nAt least the part where I’m so hurt and anxious about it that I’m literally hyperventilating, and when it’s over, I climb out of the bathtub and go sit on the couch and stare at the wall in the dark for a while, and I’m talking to her like she’s there, saying,\\n\\n“I’m sorry.” And I mutter something about it being my best effort or something like that, but she’s not there, and it’s better that she’s not anyway, because everything I’m saying is a lie, and she doesn’t need any more lies. At least not from me.\\n\\nIf I was really sorry, I’d quit, but I won’t, and after that, deep depression sets in, sinking my whole life to the bottom of this murky tank full of cold, chalky water so that people and sounds and everything else all blurs together into a sort of shapeless and meaningless monotony. People deal with me, come to the room or see me on the bus or whatever, but it’s like all I can see are these hollow roadkill puppets, like everyone is basically just turned into weird dead animal pelts strung from wire or impaled on a stick coming in and out of the grey gloom surrounding me and shaking the way a puppet does when it’s laughing. And they talk. But their words don’t mean anything. It’s all just turned into this senseless squawking in this cloud of grey, terrible depression. \\n\\nObviously, my brain is still working on some level. Sort of switched over to its criminal, drug addicted autopilot or whatever it is. My reptilian junky brain. Because I recognize the different people and communicate well enough to get along. But my face is always twisted up and tight, and my lips have disappeared leaving only a short straight line for a mouth, and my eyes are always twitching and swollen and wet. And I don’t eat much, but when I do it’s always the same bland slop or morsels of cold mush to me, no matter what I get. I don’t care, anymore. \\n\\nAnd I go to work at the trap motel room and sell dope. And put the money in my bag. And see the green Taurus on my way home, and at night, I do big shots of dope, because I want to die, but I’m too much of a coward to kill myself, and I sleep and have crazy, vivid dreams of loss and pain and all the rest of it, and in the morning, I go back to room 127 and sell heroin and see the green Taurus on my way home and get high and sleep. And another day passes. And I wake up and ride the bus and sell drugs, and the green Taurus is still parked across the street from the Lindell Motel and Motor Lodge. And I sell to Cheese and some of the girls from the club who say they haven’t seen Leticia. And I reup with Johnny and eat something that tastes like paper. I sit in the trap and deal with crazy street customers. Go home. Get high. Sleep. And sell to Sharky and Cowboy and Arnold—or at least a raggedy shadow of the person he used to be—and do another big shot when I come home at night, because I still want to die, but I’m still too much of a coward to end it, and I have this dream about Leticia dying, and another day has passed, so I wake up and go see Johnny and pay 35,000 and sell dope out of room 127 and see the green Taurus on the way home and sell to Cowboy and Sharky and another guy and get high and sleep, and another day passes. \\n\\nSomewhere in there, Sal asks me why I always look like I’m about to cry and laughs at me, and I say I’m not, but I am and almost cry because of it. A few days after that Leticia’s brother comes to see me and is waving his pistol around outside of the hotel room, screaming and barking like a dog at the junkies lurking the lot, and for some reason, he shows me this picture of himself and his sisters next to this dirty, white Toyota Corolla. He must not know she’s not with me, anymore. But anyway, they’re super young in the picture, like from before things went down with Carla, and she still looked exactly like Leticia, except I can tell which one is Leticia by the expression on her face. It’s a look she used to give me when I was being stupid. And it makes my guts twist into these awful knots of anxiety, and on another morning, I’m walking to the motel. I make the corner and find this five or six-year-old kid in a hoodie with one arm all the way into this trashcan, and it’s like five in the morning or whatever. \\n\\nSo, the whole situation is super freaky. And it scares me so bad that I actually trip and fall backwards, before I see that it’s a racoon. And so, I’m there on the ground expecting this thing to take advantage of my prone position and rip the carotid artery out of my neck with its teeth or something and kill me, but it doesn’t. It’s just sitting there breathing and staring and kind of growling, because it’s scared. Just like me. And I have a spiritual experience right there on the sidewalk looking at him, because I am him. And he is me. Fetid and naked and hungry. The terrified child of fallen men crawling in the dark and hiding from the light and looking for something in the trash. Helpless and holding onto the shiny, worthless crap that binds us, that’s killing us. The racoon slinks back into the darkness. I run the other way.     \\n\\nBut other than that, I keep going. Super sad and slow and getting high and wishing I was dead and selling to Cheese and Sharky and Cowboy and sleeping and waking up and selling and seeing the Ford every afternoon on my way home and getting high and sleeping and waking up and selling and getting high, all over again. Days pass, and I hate them all. And soon a week passes. And another, just like before. I get high and sleep and sell and see the green Ford and sleep and eat something that tastes like ashes and see Johnny and pay the 35,000 even though that’s more than Old Man ever charged, but I don’t care, and I sell to Sharky and Martin and go to the club to sell to a couple of girls there and Amber who says she saw Leticia at her house yesterday morning but doesn’t think she works at the club anymore. I get sick hearing about her. And another week passes, and I sleep and get high and want to die and wake up and spend another day selling out of the motel room. The green Ford Taurus is always there when I leave. And I still want to die. \\n\\nOver and over and over. And before I know it, almost a whole month has passed and on December 21st, Tony calls me for the first time in a very long time. He tells me that the Old Man has died and wants to know if I will be at the funeral.\n",

                                                                   \\n\\nThe first signs of light are in the sky.\\n\\nThe avenue is wet in the grey light. And quiet. And wears a certain weariness only these kinds of thoroughfares do. Submitted to the ruthlessness of the epidemic. It's a desperation you see best expressed the through barbed wire fences and bars on windows, portrayed by the stained and gutted mattress leaning against a telephone pole and the scattered trash in the gutter. It is the sight of hooded vagrants, those anonymous and harried creatures squawking to each other about how they’ll come up this morning in the back of a parking lot, the same way you might find a pair of squirrels or hermit thrushes stirring in the early morning stillness, and it’s the way their ragged figures dig through the dumpster and the way they hang their heads and push their shopping cart.\\n\\nIt’s in the face of the beautiful, light skinned black girl walking on the side of the road in her pink skirt and her high heeled ankles attached to the legs spilling out of it. It’s the way she cowers from the cold and pulls her fake fur tight around her shoulders and follows my car with the swivel of her head trying to make eye contact. It’s her fishnet stockings. It’s the dark scar tissue on the backs of her hands and the line of it on her neck.\\n\\nIt’s the crumbling remains of abandoned and boarded up homes covered in graffiti and the old storefronts of failed businesses. It’s the liquor stores and the pawn shops and the payday lenders that have taken their places. It’s the broken glass on the sidewalk. It’s the dejected face of the man squatting on the curb with his head in his hands. It’s the motels and motel rooms with dirty doors and missing numbers, that all look like mine.\\n\\nIt’s me and who I was and a million more like me. It’s the new great depression. But it’s not economic or an absence of anything. It’s the inundation of the streets with heroin and meth. And these days, I’m doing my part to keep them flooded.\\n\\nOnce I get to the end of the strip and see the driveway of the motel, I pull into the parking lot. Open the door to my room. Weigh out four separate ounces really quickly and put the rest of everything under the bed, where I keep the gun. Well, almost all of the rest of everything, because I steal a chunk of dope the size of my pinky nail and hide it in the cellophane on my soft pack of Winston’s. It’s insurance on the fact that Charlie ripped me off by watering down his methadone. I’m not sure when I’ll get sick.\\n\\nNow, most people would think that leaving a gun under the bed in a motel room like that is a terrible idea. And they’d be right. Those same people would probably think that leaving 31.274 ounces of the best heroin in the city under the bed and leaving it there with the gun is an exponentially worse idea. And they’d be right about that, too. But the thing is that I’m not really thinking it all through. I just sort of bought the gun. Never considered how much I don’t really like them and how unnecessary one would be for me, so I leave it there. I’ve said that before, I think.\\n\\nLeaving town is a hassle, though, because my business depends on me being in town to take care of my customers, especially the big ones. And besides, I don’t really care about leaving it all there because, like I’ve said before, there are piles and piles of money in my crawl space at home. If someone should rob me, I’m in position to buy right back in, many, many times over.\\n\\nSo, I take the four ounces. Lock my door behind me. And knock on Eddie’s. It takes a minute for anything to stir on the other side of the door, but finally, there’s some movement. And a sleepy, angry mumbling asks me through the door,\\n\\n“Who is it?”\\n\\n“Me. Randy.”\\n\\nThe chain unlatches immediately. Eddie’s eyes are still closed, but he invites me in and turns the bathroom light on so his girlfriend can keep sleeping and we can talk.\\n\\n“I’m going out of town till tomorrow, probably.”\\n\\n“What?”\\n\\n“Yeah. So, I have a couple of people that might be trying to reup while I’m gone. And I wanted to give you yours, so here are four. They’re separated to keep things easy. I might call or text you to tell you who’s coming to get one. My boy Martin is probably gonna hit you up. And I think Cowboy is due for one. Just be on the lookout for my texts.”\\n\\n“K. Cool, bro. Here.” He reaches under his mattress and hands me a stack of bills.\\n\\n“Cool. For yesterday?”\\n\\n“Yup.”\\n\\n“Word. Well, I’ll be back tomorrow. Should be, anyway.”\n",



which I guess is what happens when the star’s own gravity becomes too much for itself, like the nuclear fuel that the star runs on isn’t able to put out enough energy to counteract the gravity or whatever. And so, it collapses. Creates a black hole which immediately begins to suck down all of the star’s remaining light and energy and mass besides anything and everything that comes close to it after that. \\n\\nSo, these big bright stars with all this life and energy are preset for this fate long before it happens. It’s just a matter of having so much mass and gravity and only so much fuel. Bright burning giants turn to utter dark. Doomed by the equation lying dormant deep within. There’s nothing that can be done about it, and as far as anyone could ever tell from looking at it, such a thing would never, could never happen. But it does. \\n\\nAnd so are addicts. What addict have you ever known that wasn’t an amazing child full of happiness and love and kindness and a vitality that put those around them to shame? Not to say they weren’t without problems or anything like that. But they’re never who you think. Or at least that’s how it has seemed to me over the years. When people talk about someone in addiction or someone who has passed in a meeting or if you hear from their family, they always tell you how beautiful the person was, how truly amazing, how loving and self-sacrificing. This is what they say after the person has lied to everyone, cheated, stolen credit cards and people’s identities, contracted and given bloodborne diseases, put innocent lives at risk or taken lives, beaten their spouse or neglected their children and everything else that comes with addiction, but it isn’t a lie. The person their loved ones talk about really does exist, really did exist. It’s just that a change has come over them. They are not the same. It’s like their gravity, their mass was just too much for them. Couldn’t be kept up with, and they’ve collapsed in on themselves, left to a mindless and violent destruction of everything around them.   \\n\\nAnd I’m thinking about this while Leticia lies on the couch pressing the butts of her hands into her forehead and pulling at her hair and repeating a few different phrases,\\n\\n“I can’t believe this,” and, “Oh no. No. No. No.” and, “Why? Oh, why?” \\n\\nOver and over again. Like mantras, and I can hear the little girl for a second there. Peter and Carmen’s daughter. Carla’s loving sister. Little Ana’s beautiful aunt. And then, Leticia is arching her back up off the couch dramatically out of nowhere, like someone’s sticking a needle through her spine or something and falls back. Her eyes are closed, and her mouth turns up in this miserable sort of inward grin. She giggles a bit. And plainly breathes out her account of the last week to me right there from the couch. The voice is familiar but somehow not hers. \\n\\n“I knew you were high at your mom’s,” she begins, and as she tells me about how disgusting I was that night at my mother’s and how embarrassed and hurt she was, it occurs to me that this was always coming for her, that addiction was an equation written into her DNA, her brain chemistry, the circumstance of her life and that all it would ever take for this black hole to be born was a taste of the right substance. \\n\\nShe goes on,\\n\\n“They thought you were dead, until they pulled you out of the car, and in the ambulance, they gave me something for my neck. And that was it.” She says and pauses like she’s come to some great monument in her mind and is silently beholding it’s beauty for a moment, before she continues, “I never knew. I never knew I could feel like that.”\\n\\nShe goes on, telling me about how she wasn’t really hurt but that the doctors wrote her a big prescription to Roxicodone anyway. Tells me how her father checked on me twice and that the second time, I had disappeared from the room and that the nurse was angry about it. And she tells me how she knew that me leaving like that should hurt her even more than she already was. But she couldn’t feel it. There was only this newfound warmth in her chest after that and a bottle of pills rattling in her pocket on the way to work the next night.\\n\\n“One of the other girls was complaining about me, saying that I never danced and asking management what was the point of having me work there if I wasn’t gonna work, and I didn’t even care anymore. I just felt so good. Amber had to keep waking me up, until she took me to the bathroom and called over one of the other girls and gave me some coke. I went on stage after that.”\\n\\nThere’s a long pause. Leticia yawns and stretches. Her face and chest are putting out a lot of heat, and beads of sweat are forming on her brow, glistening in the streetlight coming through the window. She breathes out heavily into the darkness. Her voice waivers as she goes on, telling about how her life had become this crazy euphoric haze and how she made plans the next morning to meet up with that other girl at Amber’s place and how they were shooting up.\\n\\n“I made them do me. But I still can’t do myself, and it should scare me, but it doesn’t. It feels too good to be scary. You know? You know………….” \\n\\nAnd she trails off. Her jaw is loose, and her bottom teeth are showing. Just like that, it’s over. The whole speech ends instantly like it was just some weird radio transmission from somewhere else or something else, and now, her chest rises and falls. Heavy and slow. I fix her hair a little bit and cross her hands over her stomach and get myself ready to go see Johnny.\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \\n\\nThere’s one of those 3x5 flashcards stuck in my door jamb. \\n\\nYou know the kind I’m talking about. The ones teachers make you get in elementary school to learn vocabulary words or times tables. The ones that have those blue lines across the front with the faded red line at the top like a piece of loose-leaf does, but it’s not loose-leaf. It’s a flashcard. And as I get closer to the room, I can see there’s a made-up word written on it in sharpie and all capital letters.\\n\\nThe only thing it says is:\\n\\nDUNZO.\\n\\nAnd I pick it up and rub it between my finger and thumb like I’m feeling the thickness of the card and nod in agreement and mutter the words,\\n\\n“Let’s get it over with, then,” and flip the card up into the air.\\n\\nNow, I’m turning the key and knob into the room. Two black and scrawny frames in measly shrouds of damp grey cloth huddle next to a shopping cart full of trash and buckets and tarps and whatever else on the sidewalk, and a fatter woman in a torn yellow jacket sits cross legged on the ground and smiles up at them. She’s dividing some kind of food out of a bag. Maybe bread. She’s sharing it with the other two and then sees that I see her. So, she stands up. And walks towards me holding her hand up like she’s asking me to wait. \\n\\nI do. And before she gets to my room, Eddie’s door opens and he sticks his head out. I wave to him and he disappears back into his room. Now, the woman has gotten to me, so I let her in. Close the door and sit down with my bag.\\n\\n“What you want?”\\n\\n“I got 50.” She says and takes off the yellow jacket and digs a wad of cash out of one of the pockets in a black jacket she was wearing underneath.\\n\\n“Okay.” I say and eye out what is obviously way too much, but I don’t really care and toss a rock at her.\\n\\n“Whoah. Really?” \\n\\n“Early bird special. Take care of your buddies out there.”\\n\\n“Thanks.”  \\n\\n“See ya.” \\n\\nWhen I say it, the S sound makes a whistle sound. It’s the first time I’ve noticed that happen since my teeth have been missing, so I shrug to myself, and now, Eddie is catching the door before the woman can shut it as she leaves.\\n\\n“Hey, bro.” He’s wearing a Black Flag t-shirt. \\n\\nI smile and throw my chin back.\\n\\n“Here.” Eddie pulls his money out of his pocket.\\n\\nI go through the routine of weighing out his bag. As I do, he talks.\\n\\n“You know, bro, they got dental implants for things like that, right?”\\n\\n“Like what?” I ask and smile big making sure he can see my missing teeth.\\n\\n“Oh. That.”\\n\\n“Are you trying to say that my teeth are missing or something?”\\n\\nWe laugh, and he talks about how he had some turkey breast and casserole with his lady in their room yesterday, before taking his bag and walking out the door. It goes on like that. Like it does every day. Customer after customer after customer. Bag after bag. And when Martin shows up, he’s asking about the car before he ever even gets through the door.\\n\\n“Where’s is it? I expect to see that shiny new toy out there in that parking lot,” and he’s kind of laughing as he says it, but when he gets a good look at my face, his expression changes, “Whoa! Man. What happened?” \\n\\n“Car’s gone.”\\n\\n“Gone? What happened?” He’s inspecting my eyes and says as much. “Your eyes.”\\n\\n“Yeah. I know. This.” I say and use my pointer finger to make wide circles around my face. “This is what happened. Crashed it on the way back from Spokane last Friday. Or Saturday morning. Something like that. I don’t really remember. I just know it’s totaled.”\\n\\n“Wow.” Martin says and is sitting there with this worried look on his face. I know what he’s thinking, so I say,\\n\\n“Don’t worry.”\\n\\n“I’m not.”\\n\\n“Yeah. You are. I still got you.” I say while I’m weighing his out. \\n\\n“Oh, really? Cool!” He breathes out with relief.\\n\\n“Told you, you were worried.”\\n\\n“Well, I mean….” And he acts like he has a response, but he doesn’t. Eventually, he asks, “Did you have insurance?”\\n\\n“Nah.”\\n\\n“No? Aren’t you in trouble or something?”\\n\\n“I don’t know. I left the hospital before I was supposed to. I get the idea that it’s one of those things that isn’t supposed to happen but does. You know, like the cops felt so bad for me losing the car and getting so banged up and all that, that they didn’t even ask questions about my money or anything. I don’t know. And I’m not going back to try to figure it out. They can find me if they want.” \\n\\nAnd it’s true. But when they talk to me, it won’t be about the car.\\n\\n“Yeah.” He’s carefully watching my hands work.\\n\\n“Here.” I hand it to him.\\n\\n“Thanks.” Martin stands up. “So, we’re still good for what we agreed on?”\\n\\n“Yeah. No problem.”\\n\\n“Cool. Sheesh.” He says and shakes his head.\\n\\nSal shows up a few minutes before noon to get his pound. I keep getting distracted and looking off into the distance, just because I’m kind of sad about the whole thing with Leticia and then I’m thinking about Beth which is sad, too. The whole thing started with him, and I guess seeing him kind of brings it all up. \\n\\nSo, I’m sitting there. My mouth is hanging open. And my gaze is fixed on this pipe that runs along the wall over this patch of paint that's been chipping off onto the carpet in the corner of the room. Then, I'm looking at the shoddy finish carpentry on the baseboard there for a bit, and now, Sal is snapping his fingers in front of my face,\\n\\n“Anyone home? Yo!” He screams.\\n\\n“Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. I was just thinking.”\\n\\n“What about?”\\n\\n“I don’t even know.”\\n\\n“Yeah. Well, hurry up.” \\n\\nWe take care of it quickly after that and bump knuckles, and he leaves. I light a cigarette and put my things together and walk out to the parking lot. I make the corner to get to the bus stop down the street and wave to the two men in the green Taurus parked by the curb. They look right back at me but don’t smile or wave back. We'll talk soon enough. As sad as it will be to lose it all and even end up in prison or whatever's going to happen, I feel peace about it. In a weird way, they offer an answer, a solution that I need. That I don't have. A terrible antidote to the terrible dream.\n",
