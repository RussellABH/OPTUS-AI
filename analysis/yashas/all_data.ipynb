I've been doing the heroin more lately. I'm ready to quit and get off this shit, but I know I won't be able to handle the withdrawals. \\n\\nI've heard of a Three-day suboxone detox being a good method for detoxing without having to face withdrawal symptoms. I don't know much about it though. Is it really that simple? If I go into a suboxone treatment center and tell them how much I'm taking, they'll just be able to put me on suboxone for three days, and then take me off of it, and I won't have to face any withdrawal symptoms when its over? Is that how it works? \\n\\nAny input is appreciated, thanks!\n",

I'd never done it before, but I tried using a suppository to loosen my shit up.\\n\\nIt worked great and I pretty much had a waterfall afterwards, constipation totally relieved. But ever since then, I've been having diarrhea every single day, despite smoking dope. I've even tried smoking more dope than usual and taking imodium but nothing seems to work. I'm still having intense diarrhea and vomiting as well (but I think that's a side effect of the dope).\\n\\nI'm gonna try buying some Peptobismol next to see if that helps. I'm worried I might have some sort of stomach virus but I can risk going to the doctor and mentioning to them that I've been doing dope, so idk what to do.\\n\\nAny advice or insight is appreciated.

I would do them just once or a couple times a week because they were impossible to come by. But one day, I found a solid supply of 10/325 oxys. I experimented with them and at some point, I found my perfect dose. It was 30mg oxy potentiated with 800mg cimetidine (makes it stronger). It was heavenly. It felt like someone had pulled a warm blanket over me and then I'd just nod off and have vivid day dreams. \\n\\nMy tolerance eventually grew extremely quick with the oxy. I could 10 of the 10mg pills at once and that would *just* be enough to give me a warm buzz. After my oxy ran out, I decided to switch over to smoking #3 heroin. \\n\\nI've been doing it for several weeks now, on and off, and no matter how much I smoke, I have not ever gotten that warm blanket feeling I used to get with oxy and other opiates. \\n\\nNowadays when I smoke, all it does it makes me really drowsy, and I nod out. That's still pleasant for me, which is why I keep using, but I really miss the warm blsnket feeling and the euphoria. Those were the best part.\\n\\nI guess it could be a tolerance thing, but my tolerance really isn't *that* high. I've only been smoking ~0.5g a day of mediocre dope. \\n\\nHas this happened to anyone else? Is there anything I can do to fix it?\n",

But where do I get citric acid? Can I just squeeze some lemon juice into there and be set?\\n\\nAlso, I've recently moved to the UK and I have no idea about how the needle exchange programs here work. I've been doing some research but I haven't found anything too useful. Could any UK members please advice me on where to obtain needles suitable for IV'ing dope? Can I just pick them up at a local Boots, or are there actually needle exchanges that will hand them out to me for free? \\n\\nAny input/advice is appreciated. Feel free to PM me.\n",

I've run out of dope and am not ready to through withdrawals. The only thing I can get my hands on right now are 30mg dihydrocodeine tablets. I've read [this bioavailibility chart] and it turns out that the oral bioavailibility of dihydrocodeine is only 20%. Whereas, the intraveneous bioavailibility for it is 100%. \\n\\nI want to get the most that I can out of these, so the only logical solution is to IV them. \\n\\nI've never IV'd before, so I'd like some advice on how I should go about this. I assume the first step is to crush up all 5 tablets, and then dissolve them in some water. My following questions are:\\n\\nWhat kind of needle should I use?\\n\\nHow much water should I use to dilute the 5 pills?\\n\\nIm located in the UK. Is there anywhere where I can legally purchase these needles?\\n\\nAny input/advice is greatly appreciated.\n",

To my understanding, #3 heroin is just diacetylmorphine base, and #4 heroin is the base converted to the HCl salt. So to convert my #3 heroin to #4 heroin, I would just need to add hydrochloric acid to it.\\n\\nWhere do I go about getting some hydrochloric acid? I've heard it can it be found in household cooking supplies? Also, how much acid would I add to how much heroin, and how would I then turn it back into powder so I could snort it? \\n\n",
       "5677      I recently decreased my tolerance because my plug had been dry for about two weeks. Before that, I'd been copping eights weekly, on and off, and smoking through them in usually 5 days. \\n\\nWhile he was dry, I wasn't sure if I'd have to go through withdrawals, so to play it safe I started taking really high doses of codeine daily. I would do a cold water extraction on literally 80 fucking pills (8mg codeine/500mg paracetamol per tablet), and then take about 600mg of codeine. I'd rarely feel high but I guess it helped with not having to experience withdrawal symptoms.\\n\\nHe finally hit me up again last week, and I started off by copping an eighth as usual. I blew through that shit in just one weekend. I'd be high throughout the entire day, nod off for a few hours, and then be unable to sleep at night because of the cozy opiate-induced naps I had taken  earlier. Then throughout the night, I'd think to myself, \"okay, just one more hit before I lie down so I can fall asleep easier\", but it was never enough. I'd end up staying awake until sunrise just taking hit after hit, trying to get high enough to fall asleep. I don't know what it is, but ever since I started doing dope (I switched over from Oxy), I don't get that \"warm blanket\" feeling anymore. Dope just makes me drowsy. I still like it, but it's not the same. \\n\\nAnyway, after blowing through that eighth over the weekend, I re-upped on Tuesday with a quarter ounce. It cost me a ton of money but I figured it should last me a while so it was worth it. But lo and behold, after weighing what I had left last night after using for just two days, I realized that I had gone through over 6 fucking grams. This shit has gotten out of hand.\\n\\nI thought shit was out of hand when I was popping 10 Perc 10/325s every morning, too lazy to even do a CWE. But now I'm smoking through 6g of dope in two days. I can't tell if I'm doing better or worse. \n",

Sure enough, he came back with the dope in less than 1min and then gave me two free Xanax bars just to be nice.\n",

I've just been smoking all day. I've definitely been somewhat high, but I didn't nod at all like I had expected to. \\n\\n\\nIs it possible that this was just some really shitty #3 heroin, [here's a pic for reference](https://i.redd.it/w04y4bd9lmh21.jpg), (it originally came in a big 3.0g rock), or has my tolerance actually just risen *that* fast?\n",

The first two days I had terrible cold sweats and restlessness. The third day, I honestly felt pretty okay. Not many symptoms at all. But when I tried to sleep, after taking 4mg Xanax (I don’t have a tolerance), I only got about 4hrs. Waking up today, it seems the cold sweats are back. I woke up with my bed drenched and my bowels have finally moved. I’d been constipated for the first few days and didn’t understand why, but today I woke up and had diarrhea.  \\n\\nI binged on 60-100mg oxy and then switched to heroin for a period of about 1.5 months. Then I quit cold turkey last Wednesday. \\n\\nI am desperate for a high right now and I want to know, if I took a high dose of codeine right now,  would that just reset my withdrawals? Would I be back at square 1 right after I took it, facing the same symptoms I had the first few days, and then having to endure the full 7-10 day withdrawal all over again? \n",

I was doing 60-100mg Oxy everyday for about three weeks, and once I ran out, I switched over to smoking heroin. I smoked 0.2-0.5g everyday for a few weeks. In total, I went through about 8g. \\n\\nThe only reason I stopped was because my plug was dry. That was 3 days ago. The first night and the second day I had terrible cold sweats and body aches. Today, the third day, I honestly feel okay. The cold sweats have gotten a little better. I've been using Xanax and Lyrica daily and I suppose that's helped.\\n\\nI'm confused though, because I'm still very constipated. I thought I'd be shitting my guts out and needing to take Imodium. Is this normal at all? Is the diarrhea going to come later?\\n\\nAlso, how long will it take for my tolerance to become low enough so that I can get high on codeine? That's all I've got access to right now. \n",

Once I ran out, I switched to smoking heroin. I have now been smoking daily. Initially, I was smoking 0.3g over the course of a day or so. However, one week ago, I bought 3.5g, and today, I am cleaning out the last of that bag. So I've been doing probably 0.5g every day.\\n\\nHow bad is withdrawal gonna be for me? What kind of symptoms can I expect and how long will they last? Also, if I can get my hands on some methadone would that be worth it? (I've heard methadone is ever rougher to withdraw from than heroin).\n",

I've had some success with smoking, but I worry I'm losing some of the product in the process.\\n\\nWould it be possible to instead plug it? Could I just dissolve the #3 heroin into some water, put it into an oral syringe, and boof it? Would that be more effective?\\n\\nAlternatively, would it be possible to turn the #3 heroin into a snortable form? If so, how would I go about doing that?\\n\\nThanks!\n",

For whatever reason, I was really terrible at it and just ended up either burning the dope or letting all the vapor escape before I got to suck it in through my tooter. \\n\\nI remembered reading that it's much easier and more efficient to smoke #3 dope from a meth pipe than it is off foil. So I went out and got a little pipe. Don't know how much I smoked, but it was a great success. \\n\\nAfter a 3 week binge of doing 10/325 oxys every night, I had developed a huge tolerance and taking 10 of them at once (RIP my liver) would only give me a buzz. Eventually, I ran out and decided it was time to try heroin. It was only a matter of time before I did, so I said fuck it.\\n\\nI've never felt euphoria or a \"rush\" from taking pills (orally/intranasally). I've tried codeine, tramadol, vicodin, percocet, morphine, tussionex, and dilaudid, but to no avail. Of course, they made me feel really good, and that's why I kept doing them, but they never gave me the famous rush and euphoria that everyone hear talks about. \\n\\nI thought heroin would, but still, nope. I guess I feel euphoric but I think I'm just happy I finally managed to smoke it properly. Regardless, I feel great. My back and neck pain are gone and my anxiety has melted away. I was so tired of having to crush up 10 fucking pills and then down them all at the same time just for a 30min long buzz.\\n\\nI copped a gram and I'm gonna do my best to ration it and try not to develop a habit. Please spare me the warnings, I'm well aware of how dark this path can be, and I've read all the horror stories about how people have lost everything to this drug. But for now, I'm just enjoying the high and living in the moment. Thanks for reading :)\n",

My skull is thicker than a textbook. I've already started).\\n\\nHowever, my smoking skills really suck. I bought 0.3g and basically wasted all of it trying to smoke it off aluminum-foil. I know it takes practice but I can't afford to keep losing money learning how to chase the dragon properly. \\n\\nSince the dope is actually being vaporized off the foil, does that mean I could put it into a vaporizer and smoke it that way? I've seen posts on here about people using their vapes to smoke heroin, but I believe that was for black tar, which I don't have. I have a tan powder, comes with little rocks. From what I understand it's #3 heroin. \n",

I had to take at least 90mg to actually get high. But now, I'm out. I've never gone through withdrawals before. Is it likely that I'll experience significant symptoms from quitting after 2.5 weeks of use?\\n\\nI can get my hands on codeine but thats about it. Could I use that to taper, or would it just prolong my withdrawals (if I have them)? \n",

Sorry for the long read, writing in detail helps me feel better. \\n\\nSo, a couple weeks back, I binged through\\n- 100 10/650mg Hydrocodone (did CWEs most of the time)\\n\\n*I was doing 60-80mg daily until I ran out*\\n\\n- 37 5/325 Oxycodone (did CWEs most of the time)\\n\\n*I did 30mg, barely felt a buzz. Had to take 75mg the first time to nod. Ran out in less than a week because I was doing 60mg at a time*\\n\\n- 180 50mg Tramadol (was taking like 10 at a time, barely getting a buzz. Took them with a benzo though so I wouldn't have a seizure)\\n\\n*After I ran out of the Hydros and Oxy, the trams where all I had left. I'd just do them because I couldn't resist with the bottle sitting there, and I figured they wouldn't affect my tolerance break that much*\\n\\n— Also, with almost every dose I took, I was potentiating it with 800mg Cimetidine.\\n\\nI finally ran out and thought I was fucked until JJ struck me with a miracle, and I came across a TON of 10/325 oxycodone. I had 200, and within 5 days, I'm down to 149. I've been doing 60-100mg a night to nod (with the cimetidine). I just did 40mg (with cimetidine), and barely have a buzz. \\n\\nI haven't been completely clean for more than a few days for about 1.5 months now. How long is it going to take for my tolerance to reset? At baseline, with zero tolerance, I used to be able to take 30mg Oxycodone (with cimetidine) and nod hard. I want to get back to that so bad, but how long? It's fucking impossible to stay clean, sitting around knowing I have 149 percs just waiting to be swallowed. \\n\\nAny helpful information and advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you for listening to me rant. \n",

Just a few days after that, I took 60m oxy and barely got a buzz. Fuck tolerance man, I can't believe it grew this quickly.\\n\\nI wish I could find 30s on the street. I only found pressed once but they were great; not too powerful. Snorting half a pill would get me feeling good, doing the whole thing would get me nodding heavy.\\n\\nI can't find 30s though. I can't find anything. I'm so desperate that if I was confronted with the opportunity to cop some H, I couldn't refuse it. \\n\\nI used to think \"I'll never let it get to heroin\", but here I am.

I did CWEs to get the tylenol out and I was doing 40-80mg a day. Eventually, I ran out and stopped. After that I scored a few 10/325 oxycodones. I did 50mg of Oxy potentiated with Cimetidine and I barely felt anything. I figured it must be my tolerance, so I took a break for about 5 days. \\n\\nOver the last 5 days, all I've taken was some Tramadol, very low doses, like 200mg over two days. I figured that after 5 days, my tolerance would go down and I could finally get high. Well, a few hours ago I took 40mg Oxy and 25mg Benadryl on an empty stomach and I barely feel a buzz. How?!!! I used to be able to nod hard with 30-40mg, now I can't feel shit. \\n\\nHow long does it take for a tolerance to die down? Is 5 days after such a minor binge really not enough? \n",

Without a tolerance, I used to be able to take 30mg and nod. Now, I guess I developed a tolerance after using vicodin for a while, and not even 50mg of Oxy could get me high.\\n\\nI tried potentiating 50mg Oxy with 800mg Cimetidine yesterday. I felt literally nothing. It's impossible that my tolerance is that high! Is there something weird that could be happening with the cimetidine? Might it actually be preventing me from getting high? \n",

Fent has an oral bioavailability of only 50%, but intranasally its 89%, so that makes sense.\\n\\nIt takes about half a pill, snorted, to get me feeling decent. I’d say it feels like 15-20mg oxy. However, the side effects with this shit have been so much worse than any other opiate I’ve tried. This stuff makes me really, really fucking nauseous. I’ve tried taking it with Zofran (very potent nausea medication) and Benadryl for relief, but neither has really worked. \\n\\nI get nausea with other opiates as well, but the combination of Zofran and Bendadryl usually relive it completely. So I don’t know what to do. Do you guys have any suggestions for how to relieve the nausea? Will it start to go away as I do more fent? \n",

I found out about it a few months ago and I’ve been using it ever since. It worked great with Oxy and Vicodin, but ever since I lost my plug here I haven’t been able to cop either of those. \\n\\nRecently, I managed to get my hands on a few oz of codeine/promethazine. What sucks is that it’s pretty weak for me, even with zero tolerance. Since I knew it was weak, I potentiated it beforehand with Cimetidine. I chugged 3oz on an empty stomach and I didnt feel shit. I googled it and APPARENTLY codeine cannot be potentiated. Instead, the cimetidine actually makes the codeine less effective. So I just wasted the last of my drugs for fucking nothing, I didn’t even get a buzz. \n",

I don't know if I'm snorting wrong or what, but I don't get a rush when I do it. I feel a little buzz a few seconds after snorting, and then I swallow the drip from snorting three 4mg pills, and finally 30min later I'll start to feel actually high. \\n\\nI've been thinking about smoking it, since people smoke oxy.  I've only ever done oxy orally before, but I hear from people that smoking it is the only way to get a rush other than IVing. I know it's a waste in terms of bioavailability, but I'm curious about if its worth a shot. \n",

I'm assuming it wouldn't be anywhere nearly as bad as a gram of dope a day habit, but to my understanding withdrawing from 90mg oxy would still be pretty nasty. \\n\\nNow lets say I have a ton of Xanax and Benadryl at my disposal. Would it be possible to heavily sedate myself for the 7 or 8 days that I'd be facing the withdrawal symptoms and just sleep through them? I know I'd have to get up to use the bathroom and probably take a bunch of anti-diarrhea meds, but aside from that, would it be possible? \n",

There were over 100 pills in the bottle and I went through them all within 12 days. \\n\\nMy opiate of choice is oxycodone and I usually do 30mg to get me feeling right. Since vicodin is weaker, I'd have to take ~45mg to feel the same as I would with oxy. Since the vics were only 5mg each, I had to pop 9 of those suckers. \\n\\nI was too lazy to do a CWE most of the time so I'd just swallow the 9 pills whole. This worked, and it gave me a decent buzz, but it was always accompanied with a nasty headache. I could never understand why that happened until one day I figured out it must be the fucking 3000mg of APAP I took. \\n\\nAfter that I started doing CWE more often, but whenever I did the high felt weaker. It turns out I wasn't leaving the solution in the fridge long enough for the APAP to settle out. After I perfected my method, I started getting waaaaaay better results; a good mellow high with no headache. It's such a damn shame I didn't figure it out earlier. I must have wasted at least 80 of the pills before I got the CWE right. \\n\\nAnyways, I scored some more today after weeks of being dry and I'm feeling content as this sweet Vicodin begins to run through my veins :)\n",

Hmm, this isn't as easy as usual. A few minutes pass as I'm scrolling through Facebook and trying to squeeze it out. Fuck, this is a lot harder than I thought. \\n\\nI put my phone away so I can focus and I try again. Minor success, I feel a small shit nug plop into the water. I give another really hard push, bad idea. I had just abruptly begun giving birth to what was approximately the circumference of a can of fucking beans. \\n\\nMy life begun to flash before my eyes. I could literally feel my asshole being torn apart. I stopped in fear as I remembered the gif of an anal prolapse I once saw on /r/fiftyfifty. Do those happen if you push too fast? Who the fuck knows. I play it safe and push this brown monster out slowly and carefully. \\n\\nBy the time I was finished, I had tears in my eyes and I was too lightheaded to stand up. As I wiped, I noticed my asshole was at least two centimeter wider. My first Opishit. 6/10 would do again. \n",

I like oxy the most from what I've tried (20-40mg is my sweet spot), but I've also enjoyed Tussionex and liquid hydrocodone in similar doses.\\n\\nRecently all I've been able to get is codeine and that sucked, but I came across some 5/325 hydrocodones and I've been trying to have fun with them. I've taken 6 or 7 at a time, so 30-35mg and potentiated them with 800mg cimetidine, but it's sucked every time. I just end up feeling pretty sick and not that high. I take zofran for the nausea but it didn't help that much. I get sick on these whether I have a full or an empty stomach\\n\\nDoes vicodin in pill form just kind of suck compared to oxy? \n",

Just ended up getting sleepy and knocking out. The other time I tried it I had about 2oz (59mL) on an empty stomach and it hit me pretty hard.\\n\\nI'm facing a dilemma because I don't know whether to drink 2oz tonight on an empty stomach and hopefully get a decent high, or if I should wait until next week, when I'll be able to get my hands on some 5/325 hydrocodone and mix the two. \\n\\nI also have some Xanax and Cimetidine lying around, both of which I could use to potentiate the codeine. \\n\\nWhat do you guys think? \n",

Pretty nice in there, lot of hot hispanic girls. \\n\\nAt some point during the party, I sit down on a chair away from the dance floor and before I know it I start nodding out. Classic. \\n\\nWhile I'm nodding out, this dime walks up to me, pokes me and asks me if I'm sleeping. \"My bad I was nodding out\". Told her I'm quad faded and she asks me where I live. Turns out we live in the same residence hall so I finesse and bring her back up to her room. I'm so fucked up I can barely get hard, but she blew me and that fixed it. Man this chick knew how to fuckin please a guy. \\n\\nThis has to be the hottest girl I've ever hooked up and the most amazing sex I've ever had. I could've sworn I was one ugly lookin ass dude but I somehow managed to pull this chick at a party with my mouth gaping wide open and my eyes rolled back in my head. Great confidence boost forsure. She slept over and I have a feeling I'll be seeing more of her. God bless for oxy.\n",

Tastes fucking amazing after a few oxy's.\\n\\nWhy is sour candy such a big thing for people on this sub though? Does it feel like something special when you're high on opiates, or is it just coincidentally everyone's favorite snack?\n",

Last night at 3am (March 13th), I took another 25mg oxy. Before this, I had no tolerance whatsoever. \\n\\nI wanna take another 25mg right now, but I’m worried I’ve already developed a tolerance and it won’t be worth it. Is two days of use enough to make me develop a tolerance and weaken the effects of today’s dose, or am I good? \\n\\nI also have the option of taking some Tussionex instead of the oxy. What do you guys think? \\n\n",

I have a fairly low opiate tolerance right now and so it's able to do the trick pretttty well. \\n\\nLast week I was up at night writing an essay and I decided to chug a quarter pint of lean. Fucking trash man, barely got a nod in. I was lucky enough to get the lean for cheap, so I didn't mind much but the amount of money people pay for this shit blows my mind. \\n\\nOn the other hand, I got this golden nectar; the creme de la creme of cough syrups; *Tussionex*. Took a few tbsp and I was in bliss for about 10 hours. I love this stuff.\n",

How do I go about doing that? I can't snort APAP right? I assume I'm supposed to do a CWE but from what I understand that yields APAP powder and oxy water, and I don't understand how I'm supposed snort the oxy when its dissolved in water. \\n\\nAnd what are the benefits of snorting oxy? I know it hits you faster, but does it hit you harder as well? How does it effect the duration of the high? Is there a nasty drip like with cocaine? \n",

I've experimented with vicodin, liquid Vicodin, Tussionex (one of my favorites so far), lean, and oxy. However, I've never done more than 15mg oxy.\\n\\nI finally managed to come across a decent supply of oxy, and I have enough to take a big dose if I want to. I have three ideas and I'd like some input on which is a better one:\\n\\nOption 1: I take 3 of these 10/325 oxys on an empty stomach for a total of 30mg oxy\\n\\nOption 2: I take 600mg Cimetidine (Tagamet) and then I take 2 of the 10/325 oxys for a total of 20mg oxy\\n\\nOption 3: I take 600mg Cimetidine (Tagamet) and then 2.5 of of the 10/325 oxys for a total of 25mg oxy\\n\\nI want to conserve the oxy, because I don't have a lot and I can't get more. That is why I am considering using the Cimetidine, because it is supposed to help potentiate the oxy and make it stronger.\\n\\nThe problem is, I don't know how much stronger. I feel like I've never *really* nodded out, and I've heard that a 30mg roxi could take me to that next level. So that's what I'm going for here, I just want the full experience. \\n\\n*Also important: I currently have no opiate tolerance* \n",

I've been scammed before, finessed out of my money. I just have really shit luck.\\n\\nI have a friend, who I don't know *tooo* well, that recently tore his ACL and needed surgery. They gave him a ton of 10/325 oxy and he says he's been trying to cut down on it, but that he could easily get more if he wanted to.\\n\\nI don't wanna come across as a dickhead and ask him if I can buy his oxy from him, since he still might need it for his pain. But I was thinking about offering him $100 to get a new bottle for me after he didn't need it anymore. \\n\\nI took 2mg Xanax XR a few hours ago, and then 800mg Tagamet just 45min ago to potentate 15ml of Tussionex (Extended release Hydrocodone, 10mg per 5ml). I really don't feel much now and that was the last of my opiates :(\\n\\nI'm young and I suffer from chronic neck and back pain, and oxy really helps, along with making me feel a nice fuzzy high. I know I can just get some heroin but I don't want to make that jump, ever. I'm in college and I gotta do well here. \\n\\nAny advice would appreciated, thanks lads.\n",

How easy is it to do? And if I wanted to take only 15mg oxy, could I just split the OP60 into 4 equal lines, and do just one to get 15mg, or does it not work that way?\\n\\nThanks guys\\n\n",

About 3 years ago, my doctor prescribed me Xanax and it changed my life. I used to be able to take just 0.5 mg and get serious relief. Another couple years down the road, I started experiencing with opiates. That escalated very quickly. \\n\\nAt one point I needed to chew up 375mg of IR Oxy (at once) just to get high. After that I switched over to dope cause it was cheaper, and I needed at least 5 bags to feel a decent buzz. After a while I stopped being able to feel high completely. I couldn’t get that warm blanket feeling anymore even if I snorted an entire bundle. I can still nod, but that’s all it is. I just nod and fall asleep. I can’t even feel Xanax anymore. It doesn’t give me that feeling of relaxation no matter how much I take. I’ve tried taking major tolerance breaks from it but even after weeks without it, 10mg (of pharmaceutical bars) is the minimum that I need just to fall asleep. \\n\\nI think I’ve just absolutely destroyed my brain. Since I can’t even get high anymore, it’s not even the feeling of being fucked up that I crave. The reason I want to keep using is because my anxiety is unbearable. It keeps from me eating and sleeping and I have hyperhidrosis, so my hands and feet are constantly in a cold sweat because of the anxiety. \\n\\nI’ve been in detox and rehab several times but those were useless. I’ve tried Suboxone and I was on methadone for three months, but neither of them were successful in keeping me sober. Is there any hope for me? I know that I have to want to get sober, but if my anxiety doesn’t get better I don’t think I will ever have the willpower to do it.\n",

I used kratom to get through the WDs and after about two weeks I felt okay. I still had major cravings though and relapsed very recently I with either dope or fentanyl. I tried to stay clean by just getting high on suboxone.\\n\\nThe last time I did that was about two days ago, and it seemed to work. I managed to get a decent buzz from snorting about 4mg. Could I snort some right now and get the same effect, or is it likely the bupe/naloxone will still be blocking my receptors?\\n\\nCould I do it again today?\n",

At first I went up to 100 mg but then I went down to 50 mg. I’ve been on 50 mg now for at least a month and a half. I moved away from the methadone clinic I normally go to and none of the methadone clinics in my new location are willing to except patients that are also on benzo’s (I am prescribed Xanax, so they can’t take me).\\n\\nI am all out of methadone and I can’t find any dope here, so it seems like my only option is to cold turkey. All I have is Xanax, and maybe I could get my hands on some Kratom.\\n\\n\\nHow bad is it going to be?\n",

As of today, I’m up to 90mg. I got dosed at around 1:00PM today, and then around 30min later I puked. So I may have lost some of the methadone that I ingested. \\n\\nLater today, I plan on copping some dope. It might actually be fent a-dope, I’m not sure. I’ve heard that if you’re on a high dose of methadone, then you won’t be able to get high off dope anymore. \\n\\nIs 90mg enough to stop me from getting high today?\n",

I want to go back to Xanax because the Klonopin does nothing for me. I could do that if I went to the pharmacy and just returned the Klonopin. Problem is, I've already downed more than half the bottle because I was trying to get it to work. \\n\\nI only got 14 generic 2mg Clonazepam (manufactured by Actavis), and I consumed 10 of them. They're just small white pills with R35 imprinted on one side, and a break line on the other side. \\n\\nI think I can find a random pill that looks very similar to it, and I am wondering if I could just put those random pills into the bottle along with the actual 4 Clonazepam pills into the bottle and return them to the pharmacy. Is it likely that I would be successful and they'll just take the pills back so I can get prescribed Xanax, or is it more likely that that pharmacist will check each individual pill to ensure that they're all in-fact the generic 2mg Clonazepam with the R35 imprint?\n",

While I was there I was doing a methadone taper. 30mg the first day, and then when I left 5 days later on Sunday, my last dose was 5mg.\\n\\nSo if I were to do some dope today, and I got piss tested within the next few days, would it just show up as just an “opiate” cause I have methadone in my system, or would it specially show that I did dope? \\n\\nAny input is appreciated, thanks!\n",

On June 18th, while in withdrawals from a daily habit of 200-400mg oxy, I checked into a detox clinic. I was there for 5 days and they gave me a rapid methadone detox (started at 30mg and decreased 5mg everyday), so my last dose of methadone was 5mg on Sunday, the 23rd. Yesterday, I tried to get high on two doses of suboxone (it kind of worked). I took 8mg and began to nod a lil and then took another 8mg and passed out. I didn’t really feel high though, just drowsy. \\n\\nI know that there’s a certain amount of time that you can’t get high after using suboxone. I don’t want to waste my oxy/dope so I want to make sure I wait it out. How long until I can get high again?\\n\\nThanks!\n",

I'm not gonna spew all the reasons I'm tryna switch from this doctor, but I literally can't find a single nother doctor that takes insurance (all cash pay), and I live in a super densely populated state. My therapist has been trying to find another one for me, but she can't find any doctors either. Why do they all seem to only accept cash? Like what is their angle?\n",

About half the film is about legislation and the brief kratom ban from 2 years ago, and although it's definitely got a pro-legalization bias, it's a pretty level headed documentary throughout. Plus, anybody who's ever gone to treatment in south Florida might catch some familiar glimpses! Chris Bell if you're reading this, you kept me thoroughly entertained for an hour and a half.\n",

Subs took a few months to really help but I think steady work and a different environment (I'm back home) are really doing a number for my bank account and well being. Missing y'all lots, be well ❤️ 👌💯😬😬\n",

They ask him, \"How u doin? How's it feel?\" He mumbles .. \"Good pussy.\"  I've gotta wait till Friday morning to use cuz of my sub doctor appointment, so I'm hoping this \"fire\" name doesn't indicate that it's actually shit .. Anyway back to the question, how do they come up with stamp names?\n",

They take like an extra second to open, but I definitely prefer knowing that my bags can't get wet. There's only one or two hubs that I know of that bag their dope like this, but I wish I always got my dope bagged out like this. What do y'all prefer?\n",

I'm unfortunately gonna have to start my dose at like 14 hours (most likely) but ive been fine after like 18 hours countless times. I've got enough for a cotton shot, but I doubt thatd last me through the day. If i somehow and up going into precipitated withdrawal, should I be fine if I follow it up with that cotton shot?\n",

What kinds are available? Is there any dope where you live? Watching *Reindeerspotting* again and seeing people pay €100 for an 8mg subutex has got me real thankful for my bupe script, but also real curious how users in these far out environments really do it. This kid I met in rehab was from Kodiak, AK (which is on an island, not even mainland) and paid $100 for a point of tar, $500 for a gram.\n",

While I did feel \"opiated\" all day, there was 0 euphoria. Today I decided to take just 1mg (I remember hearing about it staying a full agonist beneath 2mg, not sure if that's true), but I've been feeling amazing all day. I don't feel that gentle opiate warmth, but I am in a great mood (feels artificial tho) and have all the confidence that only exists when I'm high. Can anyone explain the science behind this?\n",

I'm told by the receptionist I should be slightly withdrawing when I arrive. This would not normally be a problem, but my appointment is at 3PM, immediately after work. My most recent dose was at 6PM tonight. Does anyone know what will happen if I show up and I'm not withdrawing? Could he potentially not give me my script? I have dope left and really don't wanna be sick at work tomorrow. What does /r/opiates suggest? \n",

I have insurance and want to find a doctor that's covered by my plan (at least mostly), but don't know what to look for in a doctor. I have a list of names to choose from, but really don't know how to determine which one I wanna go thru. If y'all could weigh in, please let me know.\\n\\n--\\n\\nAnother thing I wanted to ask is how they come up with a dose for you? I've known people who've been prescribed 2mg per day and some at 24mg. Is it based on the levels of opiate that come up in my urine, is it based on what I tell the doctor, or does it just vary entirely based on which doctor you're seeing? \n",

He asked me if it's possible to forge a prescription that says he was prescribed them. I told him not to get his hopes up, but does anyone have experience with this? I figured they'd prob call the pharmacy or the doctor to make sure.\n",

Came to FL to clean up my life and hopefully look good for court, but had this haunting the back of my mind for like the past 5 months. Well, had court today and walked away with reckless driving, seatbelt ticket, and failure to produce documents. I got $439 in fines, 5 points on my license, and 90 days suspended, but I'm ecstatic. Still gonna go to FL in a few days to try and keep doing this sobriety thing, but now I can finally get my teaching credentials back. Just wanted to check in and share this awesome moment with you guys. Please stay safe and love y'all!!! 👌💯💯😬🙏🙏👍👻😁😁\n",

Plus I get retarded high 10 mins later). I'm gettin some rock today and really wanna shoot a speedball, but:\\n\\n--\\n\\n1. I've heard Coke is NOT cool to IM.\\n\\n--\\n\\n2. I can't imagine lemon juice is gonna be good to IM, either.\\n\\n--\\n\\nBasically what I wanna ask is, am I strongly risking an abscess if I IM one hit of crack (with lemon juice)? Or is it safer to try IV and risk missing the shot (which has like a 75% chance of happening)? As can be expected, it'll be mixed with 2-3 stamps, if that makes any difference.\n",

I'm not sure if this indicates a scam (as I've heard almost recovery clinics have no interest in their patients' well-being).\\n\\n- I'm very concerned about keeping my identity secret, as I'm in education and hoping to teach in this town, as well as run for town council in the near future. Is there any way I can find out the cost of treatment (through insurance) while being sure my identity is protected?\\n\\n- Also, would you guys recommend methadone or suboxone? Do I get a choice? I think I'd be willing to go to the clinic every morning if it meant I was getting a full agonist, but maybe siomeone with 'some experience can tell me otherwise?\\n\\n- Lastly, are there any specific requirements that I need to know? Do I need heroin in my system or can it be any opiate (I alternate between heroin and PST)?\\n\\n--\\n\\nI've been using for about 4 years to varying degrees, so you can probably imagine that it took me a lot of consideration to decide on this. If anyone can give me literally any help answering any of these questions (chiefly, how do I get started), it'd be *greatly* appreciated. Thank you!!\n",

All sloppy and drugged out. Not to mention occasionally passing out for two hours randomly. When I sniff tho, I'm driven and energized. I end up enjoying my high way more, plus it lasts longer. Anybody else feel the same way or am I just crazy lol\n",

In the past, I've overdrafted and when I called threatening to use another bank, they automatically waved it. I'm considering doing this now, but won't have enough money to waive the fee for one or two weeks. If I call and say \"sorry bout that, here's the money. Just waive my fee and I won't go to another bank,\" should I expect them to waive it? Only looking for responses from actual Wells Fargo customers (or people really in the know). Thoughts?:)\n",

Id settle for done, unless y'all think I'd just be getting a cup of backwash at best.\\n\\n- Is it sketchy to walk up to a cab and just ask through the window and ask if they can find some boy?\\n\\n- Last idea I've got is asking someone at the hotel (it's a pretty nice and big one, w/ lots and lots of bars nearby). Best suggestions for what kinda employeees might be most likely to have the hookup?\n",

Does that mean that I partially misssed? In fact, any time I try to hit and notice I missed the vein (but don't pull the plunger down, I just pull out the rig and try elsewhere), I still usually get a histamine reaction, or at least itchiness in the immediate area. DAK what causes this or if histamine reactions can still happen if I've successfully registered?\n",

Does anyone from Louisiana or a nearby state know if a prescription is required? Thank you!\n",

It started as subs, eventually becoming kpins and occasionally gaba. He's been in one program or another of the justice system the entire time I've known him, but he finally just finished parole and has gone back to shooting dope. Since he's local and his prices are about the same as what I've been getting from my main guy (45 mins away), I've started going through him. We bicker on prices just about every time, but he lets me shoot up at my house and all in all, we have a pretty good thing going (he's never ripped me off). I added him, and then his gf (whom I only know because they used to buy bud off me and because she's a true his house half the time I go to pick up) on Facebook, and two hours later I get a message from her asking \"What's up.\" I figured it was my dealer (cuz why the hell else would she hmu), so I figured I'd ignore it unless I was asked a specific question or texted directly. About two hours after that, my dealer texts me \"Wtf is going on with you an my girlfriend?\" Turns out, she told him I messaged her hitting on her, and when she said \"what are you doing,\" I replied with \"trying to make you smile.\" I asked him to send me a screenshot, and he told me his gf is a pathological liar, but I'm just a customer and his gf is his gf.. You can imagine who he'd be more likely to trust. What should I do? I imagine she was trying to hit on me with the \"what's up\" message, now is tryna cover her story (which her mom coroberated). I'm fuckin pissed, because first of all I've been working on establishing a good relationship with my dealer (we used to see each other once a month, now it's like every other day), but I know this is gonna fuck shit up. On top of it all, I'm guessing I prob won't be invited over anymore, which blows cuz I suck at shooting myself up. How do I prove my innocence to my dealer or otherwise calm the situation, cuz this is fucked on so many levels and was totally unprovoked.\n",

Make sure you have enough money set aside to stay well (and put extra aside if you want more than that), but place the rest of your funds on a Visa gift card. You can buy pretty much anything legitimate you need, using this card (with the exception of Bodegas and places with credit minimums), and you'll automatically make sure that you can't buy drugs with it. You might wanna use more than one card, so all your funds aren't lost if the card is lost or stolen, but this should keep you from spending any more than your allotted amount on drugs.\n",

Is this close in effectivess to IV? I know there won't be a rush, but my alternative is sniffing, and im afraid I won't get high from the three bags. Basically what I wanna know: is IM more effective than sniffing, and is there a way I can guarantee no abscess?\n",

Since the BA of IV roughly twice that of IN, what is it that makes shooting more dangerous, even if I'm only shooting half my sniffed dose?\n",

These are a bitch to split into separate doses (as compared to strips), so I crushed up half the pill and split it into 4 lines. If it's already crushed, I'm obviously not gonna take it sublingually, so I sniffed 2 lines (2mg) and am high AF. My tolerance isn't super high, but I still use every day, so I can only imagine that it must have something to do with the lack of naloxone? Anyone care to weigh in, because I've never found suboxone to have any recreational value, unless I don't have much of a tolerance.\n",

As such, I've been stuck cold copping, and have met some pretty wacky individuals. Idk how all the wharf rats end up with their nicknames, but the dude I met today had a moniker that was \"Nah.\" I've met countless D's, Z's, Blacks, and even a \"Yo,\" (btw a nickname that is also a response makes it really confusing when you ask someone their name), so do y'all have any interesting names for D-Boys and middlemen that you've met?\n",

I think it's extremely obnoxious to talk about any kinds of drug transactions (even weed) in any space where people who might be bothered by it might hear you. I'm sure the passengers of my packed yet silent bus *loved* hearing me saying how many bags of heroin I wanted to buy, and naming all kinds of different prices since this guy wanted my business . I mean, obviously your texts are being monitored when you're a homeless panhandler .. in which case talking on the phone is *way* less incriminating . Almost everyone I've met who does this is just a middleman (and those that act like a douche on the phone and try to bully me, acting like they're doing me a favor, I spitefully save as a drug contact .. this guy's name went from \"DJ Bob\" to \"DJ HeroinDealer\").\\n\\n-/-\\n\\nANYWAY, dude on the bus is super chill, and he ends up mentioning \"yeah I'm on my way to score too .. I just can't seem to stay on the subs :( ). I'd been trying to find Subutex forever to detox and we quickly swapped numbers. I met up with him today to pick up two, and gave him 3, 4mg pressed bars. They were outrageously expensive (I only buy pressies when I'm desperate, anyway .. I'd rather buy a football or a kpin from someone I know with a legit script than risk getting a research chemical or simply not knowing how strong the pill will be), so he was supposed to give me 2, 8mg Subutex and $10 for the bars. Idk if he was playing games, but he thought I meant that *I'd* be giving him the $10. To offset the cost, he gave me a dime of crack and a used crack pipe.\\n\\n--\\n\\nAs you can imagine, the crack is long gone lol, but there's plenty of resin. I read that there is a chemical you can use to clean it out and once it evaporates, you can smoke what is left over. Does anyone know what I'm talking about?\n",

I know that there are a hell of a lot of fillers,  but do you think that enough would be removed  to accommodate smoking if I filtered it through a rig first and let the water evaporate? I've never smoked a pill before, so I figured I'd ask you guys first.  Could the same be done with morphine ampoules? And do you guys think that this would in fact work, what method would be the most effective to smoke it through? \\n \n",

Put a phony pizza delivery banner on your roof. My boy delivered pies for 6 months without a license, but this kept cops from pulling him over (and he drove like a total idiot).\\n\\n--\\n\\n2. If you do in fact get pulled over, leave a car seat in the back. Bonus points if you leave some scattered toys, maybe even a bottle, but just make sure you have a backstory. Cops prob won't ask you about it, but it could be the difference between searching your car and not searching it. This is most beneficial when you are a minority.\\n\\n--\\n\\n**Any suggestions from the community?**\n",

I've never taken Tex before, and it'a been a minute since I've tried suboxone, so how should I divide this? I was thinking sniffing .5mg twice a day for 8 days. Do you think this is too much, not enough, or perfect? My habit is about 8oz. of potent seeds per day.\n",

Also, I've read that fake OxyContin will be the same color throughout, while legitimate OxyContin have an outer coating which is a different color than the innards of the pill (never tried Oxy other than Percocet until 2011, so I have never seen an American OC in my life). It's been awhile since I've done a blue or a green, so do legitimate ones have a specific color or consistency that can't easily be faked? Or can you tell if a pill is fake usually by just weighing it? It seems to be a moot point, since most pills on the street seem to be pressed anyway, but what indicators can you use to better predict if a pill is the real deal?\n",

Like drug users, there are many people who act on, are incarcerated for, are seeking therapy to prevent acting on, and are in \"recovery\" for their pedophilia. I've had this discussion with many friends and family members (who I'd say agree/disagree 40%/60%), so I wanna ask you guys: Do you think drug users would be as criminalizes as pedophiles (and pedophilia more commonly accepted as an ailment instead of a criminal matter) if the number of addicts va. pedophiles were reversed? I don't mean child molesters or pedophiles that physically abuse victims, I mean viewers of child pornography and people who are sexually attracted to children. In either case, addicts and pedophiles are likely ashamed of their actions, but continue to do so because they can't help themselves (or choose not to). It is something you are born with, and they are not victimless habits (a child was abused for you to receive child pornography, and people were likely killed at some point by the originating source of your drugs). I think many people view addiction as a public health issue instead of a criminal issue simply because most Americans have been affected by addiction, either personally or through a loved one. If everyone had a recovering or active pedophile in their life (although that seems easier to conceal from everyone you know than drug abuse, provided you don't get arrested), do you think people would view them with the same sympathy that is often shared for addicts?\n",

I was watching *Reindeerspotting* and was amazed at how much addicts would pay for a ingle dose of subutex (€50 in an isolated Finnish town), kinda proving that people will pay virtually whatever price for whatever opiate. What I don't get, is why bupe isn't bigger in AK and HI, where opiates aren't very prevalent and are very expensive. America has a huge culture surrounding opioids, and since getting suboxone script seems to be much easier than gettin a PM script (or smuggling dope across an ocean / two national borders). Can y'all think of a reason that recreational use of bupe isn't bigger in these areas, or do you think Alaskans and Hawaiians are simply that happy with meth that they don't need anything else?\n",

I'm producing some concentrated flake opium at the moment and wanted to consult /r/opiates before attempting to make monkey water with it.\n",

I can't afford enough dope to last me four days, but I *know* I can afford 5 pounds of seed. If I can't find suboxone, I'll prob bring CFO AKA 'concentrated flake opium' (and while I vaguely know how to make it, any advice would be helpful .. PM's are welcome, so we don't blow up the spot of our last semi-legal alternative). My only concern is the shelf-life .. Seed tea won't survive storage longer than 24-30 hours before it starts to go bad, so how can I keep my CFO from turning? There's little worse I can imagine than going through withdrawal with food poisoning on a family vacation in a southern state (all while missing Stevie Wonder and Snoop Dogg). I won't be able to refrigerate them, so would an ice pack (that I leave in the freezer overnight, each night, then left with my CFO during the daytime) be enough to make them last for days? Or of course, do I have nothing to worry about, as far as it going bad in such a short period of time? I intend on removing as much liquid as possible (hopefully turning it into a powder), but I'm nervous to overcook it or get it stuck to the dish. I've made CFO into a powder/goop that i instantly consumed once, but never put it in a gelcap and thus don't know how that differs from poppy extract consumed as a tea.\\n\\n--\\n\\n**Bonus Question:** For anyone who *has* produced CFO gel caps, is it worth plugging (or even snorting as monkey water)? If so, what's the best way of utilizing either ROA?\n",

Since I couldn't log into my computer to check the assignment and if it can be turned in late, I'm stuck going over numbers in my head on how I'll pass the class. After the discussion, she went around and handed out the graded rubrics for each assignment. B on one and A on the other. I'd completed the assignment with absolutely no memory of it. Reviewing my assignments, I saw that at least my work was entirely legible and relevant to the topic at hand (and didn't look just copied and pasted .. not like I'd know if I did that or not lol). For each scare I get that I haven't completed something in time, it's nice to see a total (and positive) surprise come outta the blue like this. Happy nods fam and stay safe tn! Get a friend or taxi if you're nodding out (especially if benzos are in the mix). As always, use with a buddy if you can, plus always plunge only half your shot (and wait 5-10 seconds) before you push the plunger down all the way. Jah bless! 🇯🇲 🇯🇲 🇯🇲 \n",

If I schedule an appointment today, when should I expect to begin treatment? Also, it's really important that I'm still allowed to smoke weed. I know finding a doctor that allows this will be luck of the draw, but do you guys think most doctors will have a problem with it or most won't?\n",

I'm a seasoned opiate user, but have *no* idea where to find pills that aren't counterfeit. I'm not looking for pills, as I'm a heroin user, but I think about *all* the heroin addicts there are in America and find it hard to believe that there are enough scripts that could possibly keep an equal amount of addicts high. I was under the impression that scripts for 30's, Opanas, and all the other widely abused narcotics are dwindling, but perhaps I'm wrong?\n",

From my understanding, all kinds of letters that are sent to prisoners are thoroughly inspected so that drugs cannot be imported, and to foil any conspiracies to commit crime. However, I feel that a large dose of fentanyl, soaked in blotter paper (perhaps disguised as an image of a loved one) could easily be cut up and distributed. Fentanyl lollipops are absorbed sublingually, and I feel that the same can be done with blotter paper (or left in a bottle cap with some water for a few minutes and snorted, like monkey water). With street fent's low cost and all the doses that could be smuggled in just one correspondence, I imagine there would be a huge profit potential, and they have a better chance of being hidden in a cell than other drugs (not to mention the short duration that the drug would be in a prisoner's system, in case a customer were drug tested). Have fentanyl blotters made their way into prison yet? Or does anyone have a similar story that they could elaborate on (acid blotter smuggled into prison, etc.)?\n",

I'm not well versed in the female anatomy, and don't know anything about menstrul stuff, so I'm not sure if that'd cause an infection.\n",

Idk how nodhackers make these suitable for sniffing/shooting (by microwaving or something .. I've heard it can be done more than once), but I feel like this would be the fastest ROA (besides maybe plugging? Idk if rectal administration increases onset). If sublingual works, I also feel like this would be the smartest ROA when you're in withdrawal, since you won't have to struggle holding them down in your stomach for 30 mins while the oxy kicks in .. When I'm in full blown W/D and finally access oral opiate, I'm always terrified that I'll vomit my dose before it gets absorbed .. So bottom line, do y'all think OP's would absorb faster if I stuck them under my tongue and/or if I broke them down in something acidic first? Or are oral and plugging the only ROA's for these guys that doesn't require a doctorate in Junkology?\n",

I saw him moving change in my ashtray to put the drink down. Normally I'd be paranoid and watch him, but I figure why would he take my change because he's a drug dealer and it would be obvious that I'm missing all my change. Well, I'm missing all of my change. It was prob a dollar and a half, all in tiny coins. His bags aren't bad and his prices are decent for the area (it's in a city but not really \"the hood,\" so it's very slightly more expensive than if I went to a city known for drugs). He's never ripped me off (and had plenty of opportunities to), so I'm very curious how I should approach this. On one hand, I wanna maintain positive relations with the plug. On the other hand,I'm fuckin pissed that he'd just take something of mine without asking, esp. after I spent 10-15 mins picking him up from the bus station and driving him home. It's shitty regardless, and I've officially decided to look for another plug, but is it worth texting him about? Im 100% sure he either did this or moved the change, but I think he moved it to his pocket.\n",

This has happened to me during every other snow storm, and I usually forget and end up sick for at least a few hours. It may be tough, but I'd either grab something off the street or appropriately ration what you have, because the odds of a delay are very high, even if your delivery date is *guaranteed.*\n",

However, I don't think I could wish this experience on my worst enemy. FYI, don't forget water proof clothes if you end up in a similar situation :P\n",

If we got pulled over and her warrant came up, is that automatic probable cause to search the vehicle? I keep telling her to take care of this, but I wanna know if this is her issue specifically, or if it could affect me, too.\n",

If you're ever sick, you'll vomit it up and presto. If not, you'll poop it out and can just put the dope in a new condom for the next day. The best part is: you can't get greedy and do your dose early. Are there any holes to this plan and why not?\n",

This hardly counts, but I try to dress gangsta with a beanie/flatbrim sometimes as to hide my race. In blackface tho, yu're *way* less likely to get pulled over, and if you do, it's way easier to lose the cops if you ran (white boys are easier to spot). JS, self-respect and $35 worth of costume and makeup is a hell of a lot cheaper than fines and lawyer'/\"s fees.\n",

We've talked about how destructive us being bf/gf would be, but I asked her out on like a one-time-dearie and she said, \"I'd love to, [Dopana] :)\" , Ugh, I crush on this girl HARD (her personality def makes her look better than she already does), I just really like her and she makes me feel special, esp. when she helped me thru a bad breakup 1.5 years ago, and just being an all around awesome person .. Tbh, tomorrow will be my first date nb6 months. Sorry for the shitpost, guys, I'm just super excited for this date tomorrow, and the best part is SO IS SO IS SHE!!! I wish there was a scenario where this could progress without us ending up dead, but c'est, la view. At least we have different D.O.C.'s (mine being dope and hers being alcohol w/ sometimes coke), so perhaps there's a silver lining. Please pray for me that she'll let me do lines of blow off her buttcheekss again🙏\n",

I'm starting to get paranoid that my neighbors hear and are gonna eventually say something, but there's not a whole lot else I can do. Can this shit just not be noisy, for once? K, thx?😳\n",

When I cop dope, I expect it to be fent, and am very pleasantly surprised when it actually is heroin. When the hell did this happen? When did you guys stop expecting to get actual dope when you copped, or at least stopped being surprised if your shit had 0 legs?\n",

I don't live in a city anymore, so encountering a lot of white people is inevitable, but I'm just curious what the racial/ethnic background of our subreddit community is? 👍🏻👍🏼👍🏽👍🏾👍🏿\n",

The bags we're going pod but turned out to be fent, so 6 hours after my 3AM dose, I'm out the house.\\n\\nThe guy I met yesterday didn't have a phone and the deal was too complicated for me to get his plug's number, so I took a bus to town and walked to the corner just praying they'd be outside.\\n\\nNo luck.\\n\\nI get about 4 blocks away by the time another homeless white dude asked me for money. This guy was clearly sick, so I gave him a dollar and asked,\\n\\n\"Do you know where I can get some dope?\"\\n\\n\"*What?*\"\\n\\n\"Dope.\"\\n\\n\"*Let's go.*\"\\n\\nThis guy was *not* as cool as the guy from yesterday. He was about ten years older, spewing bullshit stories Every five minutes, and asked for $20 as compared to $10 from the other guy yesterday. On top of this, he charged me $80 for a bundle, and I *know* it was cheaper.\\n\\nBy my estimate, 33% of my $120 investment is his come-up ($80 bun, $20 of hard, and $20 tip). On top of this, he has the audacity to ask for an additional $20!\\n\\nFuck no.\\n\\nAfter about 45 minutes of walking, and letting $120 walk, everything seemed to come together. \\n\\nSurprise, my bundle was short a bag.\\n\\nThis dude kept telling me to hit him up when I'm in town and that he'd take care of me. Yeah right.\\n\\nAt least he used my phone to call the plug, and the plug said it was cool to call him directly next time.\\n\\nI'm lucky he didn't just walk off with my cash, but fuck man .. Why be so greedy? Whatever, no more old copping for awhile.\n",

Today before class was the first and only opportunity I had to cop, since I don't currently own a car and an stuck at my mom's condo till Thursday night. I recently tried kicking PST about a week ago, and while the majority of the symptoms are gone, I still have gastrointestinal issues (easily my worst symptoms when I withdraw, and they last around 10 days for me). My dboy has been very reliable, but took about two hours to respond to each text today ... I left my house at 10:30, about two or three hours before I normally leave, and got a text about 45mins prior to meeting, informing me that he'd be very late. Since this would mean I'd miss the bus to my class (and I can't skip), I got to look forward to writing my entire share of a group presentation in 25 minutes, then presenting it in withdrawal. Since I had a good 20 minutes before class, I decided to ask a panhandler if he could get me dope. He asked for a dollar, I gave him one and asked if he knew where to cop. He said \"I'm sorry Mr. Officer, I can't help you,\" but I bullshitted with him a lil, and he told me he doesn't do it but knows where to get it. Of course he has the phone numbers memorized lol and we head off .. \"Surprisingly,\" he told me he has a bundle-a-day habit haha. He was really friendly, only two years older, not homeless, and we copped off a corner (keep in mind I lived in this city for four years, and have never seen a hand-to-hand). The deal was super sketchy, but the dope was **🔥 fuckin fire 🔥**. I had to pay $50 for 5 stamps (including the tip I threw), but I'm officially not sick, working on my presentation, and CAN FUCKING EAT FOR ONCE. Thanks for sitting in on my this shitpost with me, and I hope everyone has a marvelously day.\\n\\n**TL;DR: My d-boy bailed at the last minute while I was sick and about to do a group presentation for grad school. A panhandler helped me cop (first time ever cold copping), and now Tuesday and Wednesday are no longer ruined.**\n",

I did, but my first thought was, \"damn, I guess there was enough opiates in that powder for liftoff.\" I used to always wonder if I was getting heroin or fent, but now with all the RC's going around, it's just good or not good. I've kinda accepted that there's no source I can guarantee getting actual heroin from, and it's just something I need to live with.\n",

Like I'm scared to use my left nostril cuz I cough like every time and don't wanna make my dope blow away. I considered asking my dboy to switch the cut, but realized he probably has no idea who chops it up. It sucks because like I actually need to experience pain before pleasure, and might even prefer weaker dope if it didn't burn so badly. This was a different batch from last time (whole different color, and much stronger than last), but they both burned badly and it makes me not excited to cop dope off him in the future.. Which is a real shame cuz he's been treating me real well. Do my fellow sniffers have any advice on how to curb this problem?\\n\\n--\\n\\nAlso, do you guys feel like you can tell if you have dope or fent, based on the taste? I've experienced many different cuts, but almost every bag of dope I've gotten (certainly every bag that's been able to keep me well for 24 hours, thereby proving it isn't fent) has had the same familiar and almost sweet taste,  faintly resembling the taste of poppy. Is using taste a realistic indicator of what specific opiate is in my purchase?\n",

While this is *great* for addicts, many politicians are arguing that it will cost taxpayers greatly. Christie's response was \"Whatever the cost, it'll be cheaper than losing 1,600 lives per year.\" Additionally, patients who are visiting a doctor for the first time are allowed to be prescribed no more than 5 days worth of opiate medication (unless you have cancer or something else extremely serious). Patients who need more have to come in for a second consultation. This is an insanely progressive attitude for such a monster of a person, and actually seems like something that would help curb addiction in the state. What are your thoughts? Should taxpayers be forced to pay for this additional coverage? Is it right to limit the amount of drugs prescribed?\n",

Either way, it'll be something fatty. Does it matter when I eat or does one of these options sound better than the other?\n",

When I called him to set the time, he told me \"ima get off work early to meet u.\" \"Ok,\" I think. \"Maybe it's for court,\" cuz why would a successful (street level) dboy need a legit hustle? I'm about to reach the train station when he says \"my ride bullshittin me,\" and I'm thinking \"Damn, no car either?\" But fuck it, this guy hiked literally 45 mins to meet me and serve a bundle, giving me like 30seconds to dip into the bathroom for my fix and sprint to my bus stop. Haven't used all week (except subs), so I'm sitting on the bus feeling righteous. IME, most non-successful dealers are in their predicament cuz they rip off their clients. Not this time. Shout out to all the working D-Boys, still chasing the American Dream👍\n",

For some reason, I just get extremely excited and happy whenever I see big exchanges of trust or honor in this game .. Even when I fronted people back in the day and knew they like *actually* owed me money, I'd feel pretty grateful that they actually had the decency (incentive too, of course) to come back and pay their debts.\n",

It's really interesting to see their lives, plus all the dumb shit like flashing guns and drugs. It's like I'm watching half-documentary / half-rap video. Anyone have any good SC tags for me?😬\n",

Tired of putting my family through living hell. Tired of missing work at my easy-ass job because I can't get out of the bathroom. Even w/ subs, yesterday was on end of the worst withdrawals i'd ever been thru. I even exhausted all 8mg of my Xanax supply. Vomiting, diahrea, having to confess to my dad that I'm detoxing .. But I made it. Idk how, but he can tell that I'm really serious this time. I'm gonna be realistic by saying I know this probably won't be the end forever, but at least it's the end for now. The cycle has finally caught up to me, and I'm proud to know I can actually say \"no fuckin more\" .. it's almost like I'm in disbelief. I know it's only day 2, but I'm not ill anymore. I cant reach any connects or get any packages here for a few days, so I know I'm actually gonna be able to do this. You guys are my fam so don't worry, I'll still be dropping by to say \"hi,\" but hopefully I'll be able to finally earn the title of \"veteran,\" instead of \"K.I.A.\" in this battle against opiates. Cheers, mates!👍\n",

Many characters on that show (mostly dealers) got addicted at various points of the series, and it made me wonder how hard it would be to get away with maintaining a steady dope habit. Anyone here ever spend a long period in jail or prison and still got high every day?\n",

I hate this lifestyle, but can't think of any more orgasmic feeling than the transition from w/d to highness after dosing orally. YESSS!!!\n",

I understand that poppies are needed to produce thebaine (for oxy synthesis), but then how is fentanyl produced in such huge quantities? Does fent not require any poppy derivatives for synthesis? Counterfeit bars can go for $2 online, so how come there's no counterfeit oxy (that isn't fent)?\n",

I woke up this morning (you guessed it) sick and this time, with a hangover. Don't worry, all is Better now, but it got me to wondering how to make being sick any *worse*. In addition to a hangover, help me design the worst withdrawals possible!\n",

Next time I pick up a gram of Coke, how hard would it be for me to throw .1-.2 in a spoon and cook up a crack rock to begin my evening with. Is this particularly tricky or easy to mess up?\n",

That, or an accident from being an overall bad driver. It kind of bothers me, but I also try not to think about it. Even if I get clean, I'll be surprised if I survive to be 60 and don't die as the result of a relapse or something. I don't think I have depression issues (not any diagnosed or major ones anyway), but I can't be alone in thinking this.\n",

I used to poop about twice a day, so do you guys still think that my bowel schedule is healthy? I'm just nervous because my grandfather died of colon cancer.\n",

At least the customers will get the same drug they asked for, and can more properly prepare so they don't kill themselves .. Nobody wants their customers to die, since they can't buy anymore and it brings heat, plus I think fent patches are more valuable than oxy (at least in certain areas).\n",

I do coke maybe 5-10 times per year, and while it wouldn't be a big deal being open about it, it's not something's I want tied to my image. To save time, I put my coke in empty stamp bags (about .15 each .. out of the teenth that I copped, about 10 Coke stamps made it to the party). If I wanted to dose, I'd just go to the bathroom, dump a stamp on my phone, and it'd be lined up and snorted within about a minute in a half.\\n\\n--\\n\\nI'm prob stating the obvious, but be aware that you need to weigh each empty stamp bag seperately, as they all have different weights. Any clean spoon (the smaller, the better) should be ideal for sifting your yayo into the bags.\n",

You know, like maybe cool designs (or blank for inconspicuousness), except the decals would probably gangsta shit like guns and money to emulate consistent design themes featured on wax stamp bags. I mean everybody knows fent fucks you up (it's got no legs, but people smoke crack and shoot dillies, right?), so I think a lot of users would *def* be willing to buy em. WYA's and street addicts short on cash or trying not to be high for too long (maybe they've got a big work meeting, seeing family, or have an important court date and need to get high/well, but must also be able to sober up quickly .. who knows) would buy these *all day,* and you might even hook a few Pill Loyalists who trust that it's in pill form and not a powder. Considering how cheap fent is, any entrepreneur (of any race) who knows they won't get in trouble for stepping on someone'a toes / territory could start making fent presses, resulting in a revolution amongst street opiate scenes across America. Junkies getting well off pills that cost $3, then having to hustle up some more money to cop again in two hours? Theoretically that's like $24 a day per customer (give or take, of course, and has 8 hours allotted for sleep and hustle-detours), and this is if they buy one at a time! Tbh, I think a lot of dope users who are sick of risking their lives and being charged heroin prices for fent bags would make the switch too, just so they can at least tell what it is they're using and take precautions accordingly. This product would especially help dealers who don't have a connect (or funds) for serious weight of dope. I mean with how cheap fent is, literally anyone can order a couple grams of fent online and just press their own pills .. if they don't sell 'em on the dark web (which would be super easy, since the vendor could just use a generic pill press and ship them in an OTC medication bottle), I think that all they'd need is a chain of distribution and they'd start making serious coin. Within a few months' time, I'm sure users and dealers would be shipping this product all over the country. Just daydreaming of course, but do you think this sounds like a profitable idea? Do you think advertising the product as fentanyl would save lives, or would the resulting higher availability simply lead to more overdoses? \\n\\n--\\n\\n**TL;DR: Could you see selling fentanyl in the form of pressed pills (like ecstasy) to be a profitable venture? Also, by letting users know that the pills are fentanyl and contain no heroin, do you think that this would result in less overdoses?**\n",

Would it Ben a good idea to press these drugs into the imprints of Tylenol and other OTC drugs? If an order was shipped in a well re-sealed authentic container of the pill, i imagine flagging it as a controlled substance in the mail (or on planes) would be much harder. If dealers intent to ship narcotics internationally on international flights, I imagine that Thisbe method would prove extremely beneficial as well. Thoughts?\n",

It's not like I even live in a remote area, so I keep looking at Google maps just wondering where dope or pills could possibly be. Sorry for the shitpost, wish me luck homies.\n",

I've been taking roughly 1 bar a day for 5 days hhhj then took .5mg this morning to taper off. Did I not taper gradually enough? I don't feel any symptoms, I'm just curious if you thunk that this rate of use (I weigh 160lbs) could cause seizures if I stop the way I'm describing?\n",

I could see powder coming into the Port of New Orleans, or being driven from FL / anywhere on the East Coast. I can also just as likely imagine that New Orleans would be considered cartel territory, and thus be saturated with tar (even if it's not cartel linked, it's hella close to Texas). Anyone with experience doping in NOLA wanna weigh in?\n",

If you get a pill that you *know* is legit (try getting one of each traditional Oxy 30mg and 15mg manufacturer), weigh it on a scale or perhaps look up the weight online. Even if they're the same size,  counterfeits won't weigh *exactly* as much as a real Oxy, since there'S different active and inactive ingredients.\\n\\n--\\n\\nIf the pill checks out in the weight test, you can *maybe* take it a step further. This may take some will power (although a lot of people cop before they run out, so maybe not), but if you keep an authentic oxy or 2 always on hand, you can compare bumps of legit vs. bumps of whatever pills are in your new pick up. They should both taste the same, because they should both have the same fillers.\\n\\n--\\n\\nThe second method seems a little excessive and unnecessary, but I figured weighing pills out might do some users some good.

       "54534    Am I the only one who fantasizes about the best possible ways to sell drugs without getting caught? Alright so I *know* that this would involve a good 5 minute rundown between d-boy and new customer to explain all the kinks to this plan, but I really think I've found a way for d-boys to avoid getting popped or robbed 90% of the time. Please feel free to point out any flaws!\\n\\n--\\n\\n--\\n\\nThis involves customers providing money to one individual, while the other individual serves product out of a charity lemonade stand. BUYERS will meet the MONEY MAN and provide money (-$1) in an envelope under the guise of providing donations for Limbs for Life, a real non-profit for prosthetics (in case 5-0 Google it). MONEY MAN will provide directions to the day's lemonade stand spot. Buyer will provide remaining $1 to PRODUCT MAN and receive product in an opaque cup, the same that lemonade is being sold in. For those planning on pocketing their drugs as soon as possible, there will be a trash can situated nearby for the cups (which would be emptied once a day).\\n\\n--\\n\\nBUYER:\\n\\n- Alibi is that they joined Limbs for Life at a booth they saw at the mall (in the middle of a huge awareness campaign, explaining the surge in donations).\\n\\n- The point of the job is to go to peoples' houses and make sure they actually donate (just like political campaigns do for contributions) .. It is scheduled beforehand on the phone, often view cold call.\\n\\n- Buyer will carry map of (fake) contributors' addresses in car as to have evidence of legitimate reason to be in neighborhood.\\n\\n- \"Reasoning\" for volunteering is that it Looks good on a resume AND you get paid .60¢ a mile. *If you drive 30 miles in an hour, spending $3 on gas, you're looking at $15 an hour.*\\n\\n- If dropping off less than $150, explain to cops that it was not a productive day, or people weren't home\\n\\n- Will pay Money Man via envelope\\n\\n- Buyers will exclude $1 from the purchase envelope\\n\\n- Buyer will be given a map of locations to stop at for \"tomorrow.\"\\n\\n--\\n\\nMONEY MAN:\\n\\n- Will receive envelope and provide new map to customer, as well as today's lemonade stand location\\n\\n- Money man will Will receive money ONLY in safe places\\n\\n- Money man will change map of contributors' addresses daily\\n\\n- Money man will page Product Man money amount.\\n\\n- Burners may be used but must be tossed every day.\\n\\n- Trusted associate may be required for muscle to take money away.\\n\\n--\\n\\nPRODUCT MAN:\\n\\n- Product man receive $1 from buyer, go under desk to deposit money and receive product. Will put product in cup and give to buyer.\\n\\n- Cups will be as generic as possible.\\n\\n- Actual lemonade will be present and sold, as well as snacks.\\n\\n- There will be a functioning register or money box,\\n\\n- Lemonade stand will change locations to avoid traffic, suspicion, and potential robbery. Lemonade stand may likely travel far distances within the city or neighborhood, as customers are expected to have cars.\\n\\n- Lemonade stand may explain pager or cell phone as being associated with Limbs for Life.\\n\\n- Moving to experiment with different areas for donations.\\n\\n- Lemonade stand may explain changed locations as testing different markets.\\n\\n- Stand will never carry too much product, and fake lemons in bags of real lemons, sugar boxes, etc. will contain pre-packaged product.\\n\\n- Trusted associated will be occasionally required for re-stock.\\n\\n- Product is kept in hidden, chained safe. If cops bust stand, Product Man can explain that only the stand owner knows the combo.\\n\\n--\\n\\nEDIT: 7:51PM E.S.T.\\n\n",

With all the suboxone being sold on the street illegally, I feel like a bupe analog would help a TON of users out dramatically. No RC should be used for an extended period of time, but I'm sure a week's worth of doses would spare a FUCK ton of people from horrible withdrawal whenever they're unable to cop. Does anyone know if such a chemical exists, or if I'm correct in that it wouldn't be illegal?\n",

Additionally, I always seem to find individual honey buns for sale at the cash register of convenience stores in not-so-nice areas. I did some research and actually ended up getting the answer from someone who'd bee locked up. Apparently, most prisoners can't get food delivered from the outside (i imagine so it can't be used to smuggle drugs or weapons), but honey buns are often avaialable in prison, and are one of the tastiest obtainable treats. So if your \\n\\nd-boy goes hard in the bun, odds are he did some time or hung out with some people who did time (although that goes without saying). I hope at least one other person is as interested by this revelation as I am! 😬\n",

Medicaid covered the costs of *alot* of these prescriptions, so Purdue was still making that $10 a pill (or however much they cost legally before 2010), one way or another. Regardless of their intended or unintended use, Purdue got to cash in on every pill sold, so does anyone have any idea how much money they raked in? If you could find a source that directly calculates how many sales were from (suspected) dirty doctors, that would be insanely helpful. Shit, Actavis, KVK, and every other company that manufactures oxy 30's must *still* be making loads of money, knowing full well that their success as a pill is highly supplemented by black market appeal.\n",

Recently, I've been tapering my habit from 16oz. to 12oz. to 8oz. to 6 oz., to 4.5oz., which is where I'm currently at. I figure I'll continue w/ 3 oz., then 2oz., then ending with 1oz. (unless the following day is too much to handle, in which case I'll prob take 14 grams). When all is said and done, should I still expect mild w/d's? I've had trouble finding subs, but weed, gabapentin, and klonopin are at my disposal. Can anyone give me some suggestions on how to most comfortably detox, once I've successfully tapered my PST habit?\n",

Ended up barely feeling either and staying conscious through the whole procedure. It was only give minutes long, so the doctor didn't bother increasing the dose, but it was still pretty nerve racking to discover that I'd be awake the entire time they insert this device in my body. Anyway, if you know you've got a surgery coming up, do yourself a favor and take a break for a few days prior. Cheers! 👍\n",

This got me wondering, if you traveled with a three year old and put the shipment into their bags instead of your own, could you argue that it's the toddler's heroin? I imagine you could easily argue that someone must have planted it in hopes that you (and obviously the toddler) would unknowingly be smuggling drugs for them. Plus, the drugs are *not* yours, since they were found on another person. I'm not sure if /u/oh_no_five_oh is still active, but could anybody weigh in on this?\\n\\n--\\n\\n**I'm not sure if this would be considered planning illegal activity, so I'd like to disclaim that I do not have any intentions of doing this, and have no young children at my disposal.**\n",

All of a sudden a monster grabbed me and started pushing me up the stairs. I could hear it growling, ready to do something nasty, but could not see the beast behind me. As I could tell this creature was ready to make it's final move and end my life, my father comes to the rescue with a revolver and shoots it in the head.. I thought I was safe, but this did nothing to quell the beast, which proceeded to bash my head into the bathroom tile until I woke up. All day I've been pondering what this could mean, although I could just tell that it had to do with drug use. Something I kept wondering was \"why didn't I turn around to fight the monster myself?\" Then it hit me. My family will do anything to protect me, but they are not the ones who can stop my demons. They are powerless to stop them, unless I fight back as well. Next time this monster shows its face, I'll make sure it sees mine, as well.\n",

Worst comes to worst, they just say \"no\" .\n",

Is it because of the popularity of painkillers, which still seem to be pretty widely available, despite the crackdown on pill mills? I understand that the Port of Miami inspects more cans in anticipation of drug trafficking, but then why is coke so popular/inexpensive? East coast coke *and* dope both move mostly through DR (and to an extent, Puerto Rico), and Florida certainly has a healthy opiate scene that's saturated with addicts .. Why doesn't the dope follow the coke? More than once, I've heard of dealers (or their mules) driving down from *Philly* for their dope, and I can't think of any reason why .. Does cocaine just have such a monstrously bigger scene there that dealers simply write off the loads that are seized (but then why not also traffic heroin) ? Somebody please help me.

Being \"aware\" doesn't just mean remembering those who we've lost, it means remembering that *we* are still alive. Everybody in this world (at least everyone on this sub, I'm sure) has someone that cares about them. Whose world would be shattered if you suddenly weren't in it. That doesn't mean you \"owe\" them a miserable, clean existence on this earth, it just means that you make their life better. Much love to everyone struggling to get clean, everyone who's temporarily given up recovery, everyone who's made it to the top (you're an inspiration to countless others), and of course, everyone who's lost the battle but are still here with us in our memories.

I used to be very religious about taking fiber supplements every day, but stopped taking them when I went on like a two-month bender (stopped my vitamins too, and started eating mcdonalds for virtually evey meal). After about a week of clean time (from everything), I started making my own meals again and got back on my vitamin/fiber regiment. DAE take fiber or laxatives regularly to ensure they maintain a healthy \"schedule\" ?\n",

She starts screaming about how she knows I'm using (even tho this is the first time I've seen her in like 3 months, and had a lot of clean time the past two weeks). My friends downstairs (who I know are aware of my addiction issues, but they just think that it's pills and xanax, and don't really say anything about it) hear Ashley screaming \"everybody knows you shouldn't do FUCKING HEROIN. How many people have you seen ruin their lives over this and you STILL chose to do it.\" I look around and see just about all of my friends have walked up to hear the commotion. Cats out of the bag, I'm a dope fiend. They all say the same things: \"I didn't know how to really approach you about it\" and \"you can always talk to me if you need to\" . This is the most serious I've been about recovery yet, but I wanna be realistic and acknowledge that relapse is gonna happen at some point. I didn't wanna open up to my friends about this because none of them are hard drug users, none of them believed when I told them that addiction is a disease, and now I have to decide between being dishonest about clean time (and losing my friends), being honest about if I relapse (and losing my friends), or just distancing myself altogether so I don't end up being asked any more questions like this, and inevitably getting high again on the regular (due to my absence of support). I mean I appreciate what they did, but it's frustrating when people are barking shit at you that don't know what they're talking about. In utter frustration, I explained that I've been doing opiates every day for two years .. Anything I say would sound like I'm rationalizing, so I just wish one other addict or recovering addict was there to re-affirm how hard it is to go through this . I'm just worried about those three possible outcomes and don't know what I should do .. Should I be honest if I relapse?\n",

Welp, I ended up drinking PST two days in a row, taking a day off, then drinking PST another two days in a row. It was a fun relapse but I'm leaving town again tomorrow and plan on stopping. Should I bring benzos (I'd only use them if I expected opiate w/d) or do you think I shouldn't experience any withdrawals? It's been so long since I haven't been opiate dependent, so I can't remember how much use I can get away with w/o physical dependence. My concerns aside, how do all you choppers manage your habit (or those of you who can remember the \"system\" you tried to follow when chipping) ?\n",

Juneau, the state Capitol, was shocking in that it is so damn small and remote. However, it is a city.. A city with a huge homeless problem and in a state where the average annual income is $75K a year. Not only that, but the population drops like in half when the summer ends. The money is there, the boredom and drive to use is there, and the market seems untouched. While I'm sure that bud and cocaine would be popular with tourists from the cruise liners and the workers on the ship (roughly 6K visit each day and never come back again), I imagine that those markets have likely been touched.. Although crime is extremely low, leading to a huge police presence that would likely be on your ass, any kid who could smuggle a package or two into town would be able to make a killing. Cruise ships have security but no dogs that I know of, so that or taking boats into town would make it relatively easy to get drugs in. The best part is, there are so many remote towns that are *full* of people, just without easy access to other towns. Anyone with a little capital, willing to take some risk, and with a handful of connections (although those could easily be made in bars / places of ill-repute), could make a *killing* in southeast AK... Thoughts of an east-coaster, visiting the last frontier for the first time.\n",

These drugs are keeping 95% of my physical symptoms at bay, but I totally forgot the extreme return of emotion that comes with getting clean. Ive been crying about the dumbest shit, even if it's not sad (obviously not in front of other people). Life just seems more important now that I don't have as dope numbing my thoughts, and I can't tell if it's more scary or more exciting. I'm leaving for AK for a week in 4 days, so I expect some *real* introspective shit to be goin' on when I'm looking at these glaciers ... In short, it's weird feeling alive again, but I guess this is growing up.\n",

Coke isn't really my thing, but she was a huge addict, so we did a lot and had a lot of fun (plus I got to do booty bumps!). I'd bring bud and some booze (she was a couple months shy of 21), just to avoid looking like a mooch. Still, she offered smokes all night, coke all night, benzos (which made me wait till the next morning to be able to fuck .. I now avoid benzos *and* coke I'd I have any hopes of banging that night) whatever alcohol I wanted, and bud all night. We banged and watched a movie, but talked non-stop for about 8 hours. I'd never met a girl like this and although she was gonna bang me before she even met me, I knew she had to be mine\\n\\nOver the next few weeks, we'd do this same thing once a week until she stopped texting back (I figured she was back with her boyfriend).\\n\\nBetween then and now, we hung a negligible more times, just havin drinks and smokin. From this point, however, she stopped letting me hook up with her for the most part (sex maybe once or twice, and usually some kisses and some cuddles).\\n\\nJust recently, I hit her up asking for coke (I didn't even want any, I just wanted to hang out) and she ended up staying over last night. We'd talked about dating before, but this was the first time we seriously considered it, and I'm taking her out dancing.\\n\\nMy question for **/r/opiates** is whether an opiate addict could safely date a coke head? She's tried dope a few times, but it's not her thing. I swear, I think about this girl night and day. While I used to think it was prob just the drugs that made us get along, last night's relative sobriety proved that I could have just as much fun with this girl without drugs as with them. She's the only person I've ever been 100% honest with and tbh could be the girl of my dreams, if only I wasn't scared that her coke use may somehow drag me down (I want to recover right away .. Maybe outpatient, since I'm hopefully going back to school in a month).\\n\\nHas anyone ever had a similar situation? I can't stop thinking about this girl and tbh, would consider rocking up that finger (so to speak) if I wasn't so nervous that it could end my life.\\n\\n**TL;DR:** I'm trying to recover, but one of my best friends (hopefully girlfriend) is a total coke head. Until she recently lost her job for political reasons, she was making like $50K a year at only 20 years old. Does anyone have experience with a similar situation or think that a relationship could flourish between two addicts who each have a different D.O.C.?\n",

I really wanna smoke a Wu-banger (coke-laced blunt) when I go to the beach this weekend, but have no source for soft. Should I crush up the rocks before lacing the blunt, or just sprinkle the rocks in there?\\n\\n**Btw to make this opi-related,** does anyone else ever avoid buying crack simply because it eats through their dope? Even if I'm not coming down, I just can't help myself from ripping through my dope before/after I smoke rock.\n",

Before that, I had been consuming half a pound a day for a considerable amount of time. I've been taking dope the past few days so that I can stay off a long-acting opiate like PST, yet still stay well. Tomorrow at 8:00AM, I plan on sniffing 8 bags of fire diesel, then taking 1mg of suboxone (sublingually) around 9:00-10:00AM the following day. Since this will be about 98 hours since the last time I'd taken PST, do you think that it would be safe for me to induce sub (and avoid PWD) ?\n",

I'm a daily PST drinker and (since it would look really suspicious bringing two bottles of sludgy liquid) would like to find a way to evaporate the water and fill gel caps with a solid or semi-solid extract. Has anyone here successfully done this and if so, what is your recipe?\n",

I unfortunately forgot to order my seeds one day, and ended up having to use a garbage, chain grocery store bag of seeds this morning while waiting for the good ones to arrive .. To top it off, I forgot to eat dinner last night and ended up puking all the PST I had. My only chance at copping was at least a 5 hour ordeal away, so I frantically searched through all my empties in some jokingly pathetic hope that I'd find a bag with maybe 10% of the contents still in it .. I fucking found a full bag of fire dope I forgot about and managed to scrape two bags worth of dope out of the rest of the empties. My poppy seeds arrive in a few hours, and now my stomach is settled enough to not just puke up whatever PST I consume.. Kind of a shitty post, but this was truly a miracle, saved me hours of misery and $200 (cuz I'd have to cop dope) so now I can actually take out the girl I'm supposed to go out with tonight. Hope everyone else is doing well, that you'll get clean or well soon if ur sick, and that everyone in general has a beautiful day:)\n",

Just curious how immediate families with active addiction go about living together, lending each other money, trusting each other, doing favors cuz ur family and not just for money/drugs. If dope does keep getting more popular, I imagine this'll happen a lot more, starting in as early as 5 years. I'd say when Purdue changed their OC formula in '06 is a reasonable event to mark the beginning of this country's official \"dope/pill epidemic,\" and if kids of junkies (who will never fully quit) were born at this time, they'd be of average age to start experimenting with drugs in just six years. However, people have been fuckin' around with opiates for 8,000 years, so could any paisan*opes* with fellow users in their immediate family please share on your experiences?\n",

I drink a pound of poppy seed tea a day (usually all at once in the morning) but due to the taste / oils, it takes me about 20 minutes to drink a 16oz. of poppy seed tea. Since this takes up quite a bit of time where I'd much rather be sleeping, I want to begin making my tea with  \\nblack coffee (I've read that it's highly acidic) rather than lemonade, and then add cream and sugar. Also I can drink it at work and not have to slug it on the way there. My questions are this:\\n\\n1. Coffee has a ph level that is three levels less acidic than lemon juice (out of 7). Do you think that this will highly affect the tea's lev of potency?\\n\\n2. Are there any OTC tablets I can mix into the wash that will be acidic and not (greatly) affect the taste of the PSC?\\n\\n3. This may sound silly, but could the cream have a negative affect on the PSC, as I'd be adding a basic liquid to a substance extracted by acids? Should I buy non-dairy creamer to be safe?\n",

It's 70 degrees Fahrenheit in my town but my car was obv warmer. Could it have degraded at all? It caught some shade chillin in the center console\n",

I'm not sure if this is accurate (although I've heard it more than once), but would the same be true if you smoked BTH out of a dab rig / if you stuck a crack pipe in a bong's slider?

Now, I don't believe in \"good people\" or \"bad people,\" and I'm sure there are dope dealers who are good people overall. However, does /r/opiates think that selling dope is providing a life-crippling, potentially lethal (spiritual) poison in exchange for money or supporting a habit .. Or is it just an exchange of goods that happens to be illegal? I'm on the fence .\n",

My question is if I take benzos (roughly 2mg of etizolam daily, which I know is technically not a benzo) for about 30 days, do you think I'd run the risk of going into withdrawal? The w/d itself is not as much of a concern as the fear I have of having a seizure. In essence, do you think I would get a seizure (or go into w/d) if I take 2mg of etizolam a day for 30 days and then stop? Sorry, this is just the only place I figured would respond promptly, and they're the only things that make it possible for me to study for these two entrance exams I'm taking.\n",

That being said, would it be recommended to take DXM 30 mins before I dose PST or should I just forget the DXM?\n",

Well, I still am, but still feel like life has become much less exciting, even when high, over this past year and a half of active opiate addiction (drug abuse beginning 7 years ago, frequent pill use 4 years ago, frequent opiate use 2 1/2 years ago). I've certainly struggled with anxiety (and perhaps very mild depression) issues for the majority of my life, but the promise of the future always seemed to keep me motivated. Everything in life is going as planned: I have a girlfriend, a source of income, and now plans for grad school and a career. Now coming up on two years out of college, it's hard to tell if age (and no longer being guided by an institution like school) has dulled this shine or if it's the drugs. Sorry for the shitpost, just thinking out loud and checking if anyone else feels like they are in a similar situation.\n",

If you're strung by a bee, don't you check to see what it looks like?\\n\\nHere it was, a portal to heaven and hell, all in one. In my 20 years of life before this point, I'd experienced a lot. Should I listen to the serpent, tasting the forbidden fruit I'd been so warned about?\\n\\nUnder a haze of weed, adderall, alcohol, klonopin, and xanax, it was safe to argue that my judgement was clouded, though I knew I'd be trying it that night even if I was stone sober.\\n\\n\"Why don't you split a bag with me?\" J repeated.\\n\\nJ was the most despicable person I knew. His lies, melodrama, and overwhelming sense of self-entitlement made his presence near unbearable, but the excessive amount of pills he was willing to dispense to anyone willing to listen to his woes made me bite the bullet time and time again. J teetered on the brink of total insanity since I'd met him, but what poly substance addict would turn down free pills and now this time, free dope.\\n\\n\"Do people use dope occasionally? Without becoming addicted?\" I replied. \\n\\n\"Of course dude,\" he retorted, as I chose to believe this inaccurate response to an answer I already knew.\\n\\nI sniffed the bag. I opened Pandora's Box or more realistically, the Lament Configuration.\\n\\nDope seemed so innocent back then, giving me the super-powers to quell my social anxiety, all at a fraction of the price of percocet\\n\\nGod .. I miss those days. I miss still having a soul.\n",

After a few days of suboxone, a heroin user will have passed through acute withdrawal with minimal discomfort. What I don't understand is that since oxycodone fills the same receptors but doesn't metabolize into morphine like heroin does, why wouldn't oxycodone work during a detox like suboxone does?\n",

For 4-5 years we dated on and off. She left when she turned 25 as part of some mid-life crisis, and heroin was there to catch me when I fell. Today, I'm talking to someone else but have come back into contact with A****. She says she doesn't wanna date again, but I've heard that before and can't tell if there's a future with us or not.\\n\\nIt's so interesting to see the parallels between my two true loves: A**** and heroin.\\n\\nHeroin and I have been seeing each other on and off for about 3 years. I'm so excited to see her and while she may not be the best influence, my day feels empty without her.\\n\\nTexting A**** gives me this sense of satisfaction and emptiness at the same time. Talking to her in itself brings me great pain and sorrow, but at the time it feels worth it just to have that fleeting sensation of hope fill my body .. Hope that we'll get back together, and that life isn't all about suffering.\\n\\nIt pains me like nothing else to see pictures of A**** and I, especially ones of us together, but they're still here in my phone (just like my plugs' phone numbers) because I can't bear to imagine the thought of never seeing those pictures again.\\n\\nA**** texted me today. She told me how badly she missed how I used to play around with her and the good times we used to have. I texted her back earlier and received no response, but it's okay because heroin is here to make it all better, even if just for a few moments.\\n\\nEvery bag I pour out carries with it shame and pride, intertwined like a vanilla swirl. I feel great just a few moments after it draws up my nose, but imagine the cost that comes with it: lies, broken relationships, money.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, I always find the need to feel the warm embrace of A**** or heroin, although heroin has been much more consistent. It was getting back with A**** that saved me from heroin, and losing A**** that brought me back into her arms .. Through it all, heroin has always been able to dry my tears, as long as I have time and money for our dates.\\n\\nTonight, I contemplate texting A**** again, or perhaps seeing the girl I'm talking to. However, no matter how many times I try to grow the same feelings for this new girl as I've had for A****, it just never comes out the same. I've even told her \"I love you\" in a woeful attempt to switch my dependence, but in the end it's a lie to her and a lie to myself.\\n\\nI know what true love is. My heart has A**** , while my veins have heroin. There's times I wish I never met either, but times I reflect on how I wouldn't trade the euphoria I experienced from either for anything in the world. I hope A**** texts me back, and maybe I can leave heroin again, but heroin and I are hanging out tonight and either way, everything will be alright.\n",

I mean detox and end physical dependency, not just combat w/d symptoms .. Suboxone doesn't seen to help (no idea why), benzos just aren't enough, and neither is kratom (although lope has been a godsend.

Well, I'm pleased to say that I took about 8-9 grams of kratom 2 hours ago and and still feelin pretty nice (with my tolerance being a bungle sniffed a day, too!) . I'm very interested in trying kratom, lope, and subs (if necessary) together. I know kratom and lope both affect opiate receptors, but please don't tell me \"you'll be fine\" or \"you'll go into PWD\" unless you've *actually* done this (didn't mean to sound dicky).\\n\\n**Side note:** I don't care about the subs making me lose my kratom buzz, I just want to detox with as few detox symptoms as possible.\\n\\n**Side Note:** If you've taken subs, followed by lope (regardless if you ended up in PWD or not), could you please let me know roughly the dose you took, if you can remember? From my understanding, low doses will not cause PWD, but mixing sub with heroic lope doses has an effect unknown to me.\\n\\n*Happy nods, y'all. Love this community and everyone, please stay safe this holiday weekend!*\n",

I often end up reading the name tag of whoever is helping me at a store or restaurant and then refer to them by their first name. I try and remember to do this as often as I can, but 90% of these times are when I'm high or buzzed. Anyone else do this?\n",

What I've added to the mix is Pepto-Bismall, as the constant shits are the single biggest factor behind me ending detox early. Does anyone have a dosage suggestion (they're 262mg bismuth salicylate, just like you'd find in kaeopectate). The reason I'm choosing Pepto is cuz I'm worried to take lope, as mentally I could even see myself inducing PWD. I'm just looking for suggestions on if I should take some / how many tonight and how many I should take tomorrow (I induce sub at 9AM tomorrow). Info from those with experience would be greatly appreciated, although i'd still love any advice from people who think they know what they're talking about. All I ask is no responses from people who have no kind of educated guess, as I don't want to be encouraged/discouraged to/from doing something potentially detrimental/helpful. Love you guys. Happy nods and enjoy your weekend, everyone:)\n",

If I took lope, benzos, and weed, do you think I'd feel virtually 0 withdrawal symptoms? Also, what lope dosage / frequency would you recommend if I'm coming off a bundle a day habit sniffed?\n",

It's another thing to be a total douche about it. One of my best friends just got one month sober from alcohol and while I'm immensely proud of him, the past few times we've hung out he's just been a total dick and basically acted happy any time something negative happened to me as a result of my use. I get it he's looking out for me but like dude, you were the one that got wasted at the surprise birthday party I threw for you to cheer you up (he was going through some serious depression at the time). Idk what it is about sobriety and forgetting where you came from, five seconds after quit using. Just like rock stars forgetting they used to be Joe Schmoes, I suppose.\n",

I'm staying over my girl's house and while she's aware of my use, I don't throw it in her face (and don't want to tempt her), so I plan on doing 14 bags (about .4 grams) at 8 o'clock in the morning. I kinda wanna do two tonight, but only if /r/opiates thinks that anything above 12 bags is a waste (I'll only have about 10 minutes to sniff my shit). Do you think 14 bags would get me higher than 12, or would I just be wasting the extra two bags?\n",

Heroin makes me a little too energetic but can get me in the zone if I'm in the right frame of mind. PST however, while not as potent as heroin, just mellows me out and makes me feel content enough to get the chores done that I know need to be completed. Regardless, opiates (or even light doses of benzos) in general seem to always make it easier for me to study than any kind of amphetamines. Anybody else feel this way about opiates and studying / doing anything that requires concentration?\n",

The first time we hung out, I couldn't even get hard (a and this girl is *way* out of me league, but was very understanding of the coke dick). The next morning when I'd sobered up and only did my normal three-bag dose, I achieved full erection and even almost busted a nut (Egad!) ! Does anyone have any suggestions on how to prevent flaccidity caused by drugs, other than \"don't do the drugs that make you flaccid\" ?\n",

He told me to **breathe through your mouth until it fully absorbs** and by god, it works. Seeing as how I barely get high anymore, I sniffed four bags after we cop and barely made it home (later on discovering I head a burnt out headlight, to boot). Be safe out there everyone but please follow this advice.. It will save *at least* half your dope.\n",

The morning before detox, I want to sniff 10 bags so that I don't start going into w/d before bed (also so I don't feel like total shit and relapse if I wake up at 5AM before I'm able to dose my sub). A few questions:\\n\\n1. How long should it take the average person to sniff 10 bags and not waste any via post-nasal drip?\\n\\n2. For a habit that's on average about 12 bags a day (insufflated), does 2mg sound like a good dose to induce (I have a whole bottle of benzos) ?\\n\\n3. I understand that most individuals have different opinions on this, but has lope ever caused you PWD (please only answer this question if you've mixed the two before)?\\n\\n4. If I somehow end up in PWD (or am in w/d from not taking sub at a high enough dose) would an immediate re-dosing of more sub cure my ailment or cause PWD in itself?\\n\\n5. If anyone has any tips for easing into w/d or keeping level-headed to prevent relapse (not forever, just for a few days so I'm not physically dependent on opiates), please feel free to share. The best one I've read is **\"If you try to quit quitting, you'll be right where you started. When you were right where you started, you'd have given anything to be right where you are now.\"**\n",

Woke up at 7:30, feeling w/d kickin in, so I decide to take 9grams of kratom to ease into the sub. Take 3mg of sub and feel ok, couples with like 4mg of etizolam (for those unfamiliar, that'd be like one and a half xanax bars). Since I still feel kinda weird, I take 2mg of sub about two hours after the first dose and 30 minutes later, end up in PWD.. Can anyone explain what might've happened? I'm like scared to detox now\n",

Hit up my middle man that I've been seeing about twice a week for the past four months. I pay $250 for a brick of okay shit, and he asks for $35 as a normal fee. Today, after seeing me in like the most pitiful state any human has ever seen me, he charges me $10 to drive MY car ONE way to the dope spot so I don't get into an accident throwing up into a shop-rite bag. I finally get home and what a surprise, an entire bundle is missing (oh yeah, this was supposed to be his *last* time.. AKA he'll start again in two weeks). This guy was like a professional tho. I'm on unemployment and he makes 80K a year.. I'm just so fuckin livid cuz I'm prob gonna be sick before my poppy seeds come in, solely as a result of this stolen bundle. I thought we were friends, man. In all my years of using, and I know my habit is worse than his, I've never even considered stealing once to support my habit. I'm sure it's karma for something I did but who the fuck knows. Fuck junkies. Actually, fuck scumbags.\n",

This seems like a silly question but if nobody is willing to post your bail, do you have to wait there until your court date?\\n\\nAlso, if I use dope and then use the same amount 2 hours later, I know I won't feel a rush but am I wasting my dope or am I still increasing/extending my high?\n",

I've concentrated PST (no lemon juice) from about 250ml to 50 ml over the course of 3 hours (at 170 degrees F so I don't fuck with the codeine or morphine). I'm nervous that I won't have another opportunity to get three more hours to concentrate this dose further before it spoils (I can't refrigerate it without raising suspicion), so do you think that I'd be able to successfully plug this much fluid? If I did, do you think id have to lay on my side for like a long as time or should ten minutes do the trick?\n",

In an effort to blend in with the local environment, I keep a magnet on my car of that university, as to make it seem as though I am a student of the college. Today, I found a \"We support [state I live in] State Police\" magnet in my house. If I were to put this on my car under the university magnet, do you think that I would be less likely to be pulled over, or would it seem that I am \"trying too hard\" to show my appreciation for police (plus the university magnet makes it apparent that I am a college student and likely a young adult)?\n",

As a sniffer, would I be able to mix etizolam with PG and snort it like monkey water?\n",

I plan to use at about 3 or 4 and end up having like 16 hours between dosing and using\\n\\nJust to clarify: I'm more worried about PWD than wasting my shit\n",

I'd like to extend this warning to people who cop in Newark, NJ (I already commented on the fent thread) because much of the dope that has infected the Lehigh Valley is specifically from Easton, PA. Easton's gang activity is most strongly associated with Newark, NJ (and to a smaller extent, NYC), so please be careful if you live around or cop near either areas. Even if you don't normally, do please test shots until this dies down, especially if you're considering relapse or haven't used in like two or more days. Thanks for reading and Jah bless.\n",

And if I take dxm to potentiate, what dose should I take and should I take dxm ir or xr?\\n\\nThe weird question is this .. Since H had like a 10% oral bioavailability and intranasal is about 40%, would four bags eaten be equivalent to 1 bag sniffed?\n",

Pickadilly circus is now my background on my phone to encourage me to stay clean and save my money .. Christ if I could stay clean for literally one month, I'd be able to afford the trip .. Can anyone, preferably someone with clean time, give me some tips on how I could stay clean for just one month? It's all I need to save up enough money.. I know this is a bit off topic, I just don't know who else to come to regarding this topic. I don't wana look back on my time receiving unemployment benefits and all the time in the world and be like \"well I didn't do much but I sure got hella high.\"\n",

All my friends walked through fine w/ no pat downs, but bags were extremely thoroughly searched. I was shitting bricks w/ 3 felonies and a misdemeanor crammed in my shoes, getting all kinds of laughed at by my friend who only drinks .. Happy new year🎉🎊🎈\n",

If anyone has tried and failed,  or simply has an idea for a hiding spot that doesn't involve extreme discomfort, please share !\n",

I tripped on my feet and hit my head, was out cold for like 3 mins and splitting up blood. I was about to lock up my dope but this happened before I did and the cops were the first to arrive .. I don't recall any of this but my dad says they thought I was on drugs (cuz they saw my vape lol but I had a seizure so they thought it mighta been k2) and that I kept panicking that they'd go into room (cuz that's not suspicious right).. Still a lil delirious but I'm otherwise ok. You know how they say, \"always wear clean underwear unless u end up in the hospital\" ? Same goes for drugs. Be careful, lock your shit up at all times, and merry Xmas.\n",

When I know I'm gonna cop dope tho, I need to make sure I have some smokes. The same goes for stims, although it is very rare that I use them. On a scale of 1 - 10, this is how much I enjoy cigarettes on other substances:\\n\\nOpiates - 10/10\\n\\nStimulants (adderall, coke, Molly on rare occasion) - 8/10\\n\\nAlcohol - 7/10\\n\\nBenzos - 4/10\\n\\nCoffee - 3/10\\n\\nWeed - 2/10\\n\\nSober - 1/10\\n\\nBasically what I'm wondering is why they seem almost necessary whenever I use opiates? Like I love my vape and for the most part, dislike cigarettes when I'm sober but I enjoy cigs like twice as much as my vape on opiates. I know a lot of it has to do with personal preference, but there has to be some kind of science behind this.\n",

Just curious if anyone knows of any means of finding freelance work (I'm not particularly strong but I can write/proofread very well).. Not even necessarily drug related, just looking to supplement my income and figured some of you guys must use some of these means lol.\n",

The holidays have been hard being alone but at the same time, it's true \"what doesn't kill you makes you stronger\" (Kelly K. R.I.P.). If anyone has tips on how to taper or how to ease into suboxone (I can't handle the w/d, dose too early, go into PWD), please send me a PM. I'm thinking a heroin taper followed by lope? Idk, just needed to vent.. Wish me luck and Jah bless.*\n",

It's about African child soldiers and my pillow is prob going into the dryer soon as a result. It sucks that we are junkies, but seriously praise God (Allah, Yahweh, or the universe) that we live in the western world. The bottom line is, I'm glad that I'll likely never have to know.. For real, I thought it was slow at first but check this out dawg, this film is fuckin amazing.. Plus they sniff this shit called brown-brown the entire movie (dope or coke mixed with gunpowder to hit your system quicker).\n",

The link below is like $60 so does anyone know of anything cheaper? After much research, I couldn't find anything similar (for those not opening the link, t's designed for people with poor will power to put sweets in there and time-lock it so that it will only open after the timer runs out... This can be set from 1 minute to 10 days .. It also runs on batteries so you can stash it somewhere and not leave it plugged in).\\n\\n—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—\\n\\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Kitchen-Safe-Locking-Container-Height/dp/B00JGFQTD2\\n\\n—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—\\n\\n**UPDATE: Expected delivery, Dec. 15.

I took /r/bigdaddy723's advice and sniffed all 7 at 10 am. I'll be taking 9 grams of kratom extract (plus some etizolam, weed, and maybe a concerta) at 9 am tomorrow morning and 3mg of sub around 1. It'll have been 27 hours since I sniffed my bags, but I'll have sniffed 7 that were fully absorbed (no nasal drip) :/ . Do you think I'll end up in PWD? **BTW: From 95% of my research, kratom does *not* cause PWD when mixed with suboxone.**\n",

My sinus infection has returned, and I've been wasting like all of my shit (so to speak). I've IV'd once, don't wana try it again, but still have the rig with the needle ripped out with pliers. I have these 7 questions:\\n\\n—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—\\n\\n**1.** *Should I take a bunch of lope before bed (to clog my intestines) or a bunch of laxatives before bed (to shit everything out)?*\\n\\n**2.** *I use lotion on my toilet paper for a cleaner, more thorough wipe .. Could that effect absorption?* \\n\\n**3.** *What position should I be in when inserting?*\\n\\n**4.** *How far should I shove the needle (it's regular 30 gague 1cc insulin needle with the needle pulled out) up my bum?*\\n\\n**5.** *After insertion, how should I angle my body to ensure that I receive full absorption?*\\n\\n**6.** *Is there any trick to pulling out the needle so no dope-water comes out?*\\n\\n**7.** *Roughly how much water should I put in the syringe?*\\n\\n—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—•—\\n\\n**Guys, I am very sorry to bug you with all this but I have no means to cop tomorrow so if I fuck this up, I will be sick all day and have family to see. Please don't give me any troll posts or tell me to try IV'ing again, it's not a road I want to walk down. I'm gonna waste any dope going up my nose so *please, please* will one kind, experienced soul inform me of what to do? I need your help, for the love of god, please help.**\n",

I always end up w/ PWD and have to call my dealer. Kratom doesn't get me high (unless in wicked high doses). I was gonna ask /r/kratomkorner but figured you guys would know better. **If I take kratom like 18 hours after dope, then take a sub about 6 hours later (24 hours after sniffing 5 bags of dope), will I go into PWD? Can kratom before suboxone cause PWD in any instance?**\n",

In college, I used to buy tubes to roll stoges (with one of those rolling machines) and have like 59 left. My method is to rip out a filter, tear it in half, and place each half in my nostrils (just before the opening of the nasal cavity). The excess-heroin-musous soaks into the filters, which I then toss into a bottle cap. I add a little bit of water from a rig who's needle's been pulled out (after tearing the two boogery-filter-pieces to bits), then draw the fluid back up with a syringe.\\n\\n**YES,** I'm aware that this is disgusting, but it also carries quite a decent amount of heroin. This can be plugged (if that's your thing), or shot back into your nostrils right before you sniff any more dope, the next time you use (some people sniff a drop or two of water before sniffing their dope). If following the latter (second) method, just make sure to close one nostril while injectingf then close the other nostril when finished (until you're sure that almost all of the liquid has been absorbed).\\n\\n**1st TRIAL WAS A SUCcESS,** but can anyone think of a better way to improve the method? Understood, it's not particularly glamorous, but you will be saving quite a bit of dope, and the filters aren't even noticeable if you angle them correctly.\\n\\n**The floor will now be taking questions, as well as comments.**\n",

Put about a bag and a half dope in the cab, put a my rig in the bottle of water and pulled out just enough water to add to the cap. Put a piece cotton in, drew the liquid out, and shot it in the crook of my arm (with maybe a centimeter of needle still sticking out (I used a suit tie as a tourny). I had sniffed 5 bags and taken .6 of etizolam to muster up the courage to buy these rigs and I'll tell you, idk how you guys do it.\\n\\nI felt nice and high before the shot but afterword, could barely fuckin function (it took me an hour to trype this text). Worst part is, 30 minutes into my zombie-esque state, I wanted another shot!\\n\\nI just sniffed my scrapes and saved a bad for tomorrow morning, but these rigs are going straight to homeless people (hopefully they may hook me with a connect if I give all 9 to one dude). I like my dope giving me energy (maybe a nod or two if I add some etiz), but fuck this zombie-state tang names me look totally fucked up. I live with my dad and will certainly be kicked out if he finds out I'm shooting up.\\n\\n**I MUST ASK THO,** I've had alot of trouble sniffing sub strips. My current method is putting 1-2mg in a bottle cap with two parts baking powder to one part shbkxone. I pour out the mixture onto a used gift card, let it dry, scrape it off, chop it up, and sniff it.\\n\\n**HERE'S THE QUESTION:** If I pull the needle out of the rig, mix some sub and water in the barrel of a (fresh) rig, is there anything I can replace the pointy needle with so that a spray comes our of the rig, coating mg nostrils with sub (so it doesn't all float down my throat) ?\\n\\n***Thank you for the patience to read my long-ass post, btw.***\n",

The prime hours for teachers to call out, unfortunately, are 10pm to 5:30AM. I got up at 5:30 and found no work, so took 1.2mg etizolam, sniffed three bags of halfway decent dope, and a .2 of pretty lousy coke .. I felt on fleek for about 15 minutes until I passed out mid-snapchat-selfie and arguing with my ex over text.\\n\\nAnyway, I woke up about 45 mins later, popped another .5 of etiz. 3 more stamps, and another .2. I've been telling myself to go to the gym forever and needless to say, I'm not likely to be much more in the mood to go any time soon.\\n\\nAnyone have experience with a similar combo and think it's dangerous / titty-bang awesome / will lengthen of shorten my high,\\n\\nI'm about to take a shower and mix some sub strip with baking powder and water so it's dry (to sniff) by morning, so if anyone could respond in 20 mins that'd be extra extra cool. Otherwise I'll utilize this info for future knowledge .. Thanks!\n",

Some people (newbies) may think you're serious so just plz plz make sure it's obviously a joke when it's said. I don't see this often but some users encourage Redditors who snort to make the switch to the needle and it appalls me. Yes, It'll save you money for like a month before it starts taking over but in the grand scheme of things, I'm sure 95% of booters on this site wish they never made the switch. Idk, I'm never one to preach \"harm reduction or gtfo\" but please don't do anything to encourage the progression of an addiction as many visitors to our sub are more impressionable than you think.. Just my two cents.\n",

Not sure how I feel about the show, but it's mostly positive. Plus Anna Farris is hot. Anyone else ever get a chance to catch this?\n",

I'm a suburbanite, recent college graduate, and far from economic respite .. I wear a tie to work everyday, often giving me this false sense of superiority over other junkies. Since I live with my folks (who are semi-aware, but don't hate me) and generally make a decent wage, I feel like it's gonna be even harder for me to determine what my rock bottom is to quit .. I'm rambling (and wish I could set this up like one of those Facebook \"what Decter character are you?\" posts), but do you generally feel like you fall under a certain opiate-user stereotype? Professional junkie? Chronic pain housewife? Frat boy pillhead? Vagrant dopefiend? Everyone's situation is unique, but I feel like most fellow opiate users I've met often share similar characteristics, falling into one group or another.\n",

Add one drop of water per mg of of sub strip into a soda cap. Add one part baking soda for every part sub. Stir and dump onto a flat surface. Wait about 12 hours to dry (maybe less), scrape off, chop up, sniff powder instead of sub strip juice. You're welcome.\n",

However, the drip kills me every time. Is there any way I could mix part of a sub strip with a drop of water and some baking powder / baking soda? Does anyone have any experience with this?\n",

I explained to my boss (who was surprisingly understanding) that I've been having issues for like ten years as far as randomly falling asleep. It hasn't really reached it's zenith, however, since I started my regular use of opiates. Leaving out the drug parts obviously, I explained how I frequently dose off at the wheel (even once on route 287, if anyone's familiar with how dangerous that highway can be, esp. around exit 14 at rush hour **&lt;-** ***not near where I live btw so not sourcing here***), l almost got fired the first day of my last job by falling asleep during training (it was a tech-support job, and \"training\" consisted of watching a co-worker answer calls for 9 hours), and used to do push-ups in the bathroom to stay awake at the job I had before *that* one, which involved customer service. Essentially, I randomly fall asleep anywhere that I'm forced to sit down for awhile, but am never tired if I'm moving around (like when I was a substitute teacher). My folks now want to have me see a doctor to see if I should be prescribed adderall, but this will of course require blood work. I need to make sure that my system is free of opiates because I'm not tryna lose whatever jobs I have in the future, and more importantly I need to make sure I don't crash my car and die one day. This has become the first time in my life where I've determined that if I don't stop my opiate use, it may easily lead to my early demise. I really want to live, even if it's not as fun. Who knows, maybe it's not opiate related after all and I'll end up with an adderall script! Detox begins Monday morning (I've got subs and etiz so I should be good), so wish me luck people. I feel like I've got a lot to offer this world (currently in school to hopefully teach high school in two-three years), so here's to hoping I can live long enough to change some lives. Don't worry guys, I'm not going anywhere (at least while I'm taking subs), but let's hope that I get this taken care of. This is /u/Dopana reaching out for some love .. Over and out, party people. \n",

Needless to say, it's a beautiful day so send me a message or comment if you wana talk ! As always, happy nods:)\n",

Finally, day 8, I open my mailbox to find my package from Sweden .. Surprised how flat it is. Turns out, my envelope was delivered open and I had to go explain to the post office how my \"nasal decongestant\" was missing. Have not been this pissed in some time. It's the most reputable vendor I've heard of, so I don't think I've been scammed but my whole day is easily ruined (unless I get a phone call from the post office in the next 45 minutes that they'd found it).\n",

How has your condition effected your use? Are you honest with your friends (and drug friends) about it? If you're not sharing needles, I don't see how this could bother others, aside from their concern for you. Any comments or thoughts you'd be willing to share?\n",

I've tried to make CFO in the past, but have a huge issue with the poppy seed extract caking to the dish. It is very hard to scrape off, and I'm nervous that glass is being scraped off with it. Does anyone with CFO experience spray with pam, use/don't use lemon juice when making the tea, or have any other suggestions?\n",

I wana go cop but I'm scared that there might be an investigation underway.. Has anyone ever heard of police tracking down the dealer, watching them, and popping any customers that buy from them so that they have more fodder in court?\n",

The Analog Act only applies to schedule I and II substances. Etiozolam is legal in all but three states because it is an analog of a schedule IV drug (alprazolam). Theoretically, I don't see why a buprenephorine analog couldn't be synthesized. Obviously this wouldn't be approved by the FDA, but it could certainly be sold as an RC by clear net vendors. This would be *extremely* useful for users trying to quit and even that small fraction of the pie chart that uses subs recreationally. Low prices, no medical insurance necessary, completely legal, and no evidence on your medical record that you were addicted to opiates. Can anyone find any holes in my plans or think it would work?

You add filler and press them into the shape of generic OTC meds or a pill u already have a script for. This would also be great for dealers and customers because as long as the customers knew what was going on, cops would not second guess any of the pills they came across. The reason I say to press crushed up pills and not dope/coke is because drug dogs would have nothing to sniff out and indicate they are pressies. Can anyone find any holes in my plan or did I just come up with a way to safely travel with (and even distribute) pharmaceutical narcotics? Btw it's my 23rd bday so happy nods errybody!\n",

Would she volunteer there if she had not been taught the importance of (and more importantly encouragement to) helping your brother man?\\n\\nPerhaps a man acts selfishly for reasons he does not understand, but it is his past (if not a mental disorder) that has caused his actions.\\n\\nPeople do good things as a result of good intentions, taught to them by their environment.\\n\\nPeople do bad things because they believe their intentions are good, or feel like they’ve been taught not to care whether they do good or bad.\\n\\nGood people and bad people are the same. They are each a victim of circumstance.\\n\\nWe will never fully understand why we do the things we do, but look at mass murderers on T.V. Even Osama bin Laden’s actions were an attempt to create what he thought would be a better world for his family and his people (and likely to seem more powerful, but he would not carry these intentions if he was not taught the value of true power).\\n\\nThis is not an invitation to avoid guilt, but instead encouragement to evaluate what is important to you … and why. Your actions depend on what life goals you find to be most important.\\nI pray that after we pass on, we’ll have this explained to us. In the meantime, forgive your brother. Your “best friend” who ripped you off, that crackhead always asking for change for “the train” or a “phone call,” even though he’s spending that money directly on drugs.\\n\\nMy main message here is that for those of you who feel guilty for your use, don’t feel guilty but hopefully do something about it. Something drove you to use (as I’m sure you all know, even if you’re not exactly sure what it was), but you’ll never find peace with it unless you approach it with a clean mind.\\n\\nIf you’re still planning on using then go right ahead, but please realize that for every hurtful thing you do (hurt family members, stealing), there’s a reason behind it.\\n\\nTo my brothers in recovery, don’t feel guilty. You are responsible for maybe 1% of the things that shaped (and continue to shape) your life. Keep fighting the good fight.\\n\\nTo my brothers still using, nod on. Staying high for the rest of your life to escape your problems can be a decision of yours, but please consider a break at some point that’s long enough to start to reach and deal with your inner issues.. I may have an excuse to continue using (which I do), but I think it's starting to become time to evaluate what is most important in life (a good job, staying musically active, and *most* importantly, **family.**\\n\\nY’all have helped me through so much, and I love you all. Good luck to everyone in their decisions, just don't let guilt bring you down. &lt;3\\n\\n**DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT SUPPORT MASS MURDERERS, SCAMMERS, OR OSAMA BIN LADEN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.**\n",

My habit isn't insane but I would definitely have horrible w/d if I stopped using cold turkey. I was thinking about bringing poppy seeds but I feel like a pound of poppy seeds in my carry on (although legal) would look sketchy as fuck. If I it questioned by TSA even for like a second and my dad realized I had brought them, it would ruin the entire trip. Seeing as how etizolam is unscheduled in the state that I am leaving from and heading toward, I will be bringing that along with. If I just consumed a fuck-ton of immodium, some etizolam, and maybe a low dose of DXM (if I can't cold cop some weed), do you think id be able to avoid withdrawal altogether? I've read something somewhere that immodium can take care of like 90% of w/d symptoms, but not 2 days in a row. I'm gonna consume poppy seed tea Friday morning so I'll def be good for that whole day, I just need to make sure I can avoid withdrawal Saturday and Sunday. What do y'all think I should do\n",

No judgement from me of course, just curious.\n",

Makes u feel great without knocking you the fuck out like xanax. Please don't kill me but I even tried snorting half of one, as I've read that some people find it effective. It definitely comes on faster, stronger, and for shorter duration, so there must be *some* truth to it.. I've tried sniffing sub strips in the past by adding a drop of water, but sniffing liquid is not very fun or easy. I'm considering putting 1mg of sub into a bottle cap, adding two drops of water, adding .6mg of etizolam powder, and waiting for them to dry together. I imagine that I'd end up with a cocktail that results in a suboxone-spiked etizolam powder, easier to snort then simply snorting suboxone strips. I'll report back with my results but does anyone suppose this would work / has done something similar?\n",

I am starting opiaye withdrawal on Wednesday and will be using subs for about 3 days. I'm prob gonna be using .6-1.2mg of etizolam daily to supplement the subs, and to help carry me through the first couple days where I'm using no opiates whatsoever. If I use this dose of etizolam (they're 1.2mg pills so basically no more than one pill a day) every day for 14 consecutive days, should I expect benzo (or thienodiazepine) withdrawal? I've only gone through benzo withdrawal once and it was the most hellish experience I've ever endured (was going through sub withdrawal at the same time). If you think I will go through withdrawal from 14 days of use, how many days would u recommend would be the max I could go without withdrawing? Sorry for the 20 questions, just have a vacation coming up in 2 weeks where I won't be able to bring opiates so I like **need** to detox before I leave.. However, I'm not tryna trade one demon for another (and much worse) one. Thanks again for the help homies, happy nods!\n",

I tried taking advantage of Labor Day weekend by detoxing.. About three days ago, I switched to dope so I could detox from a short acting opiate instead of PST which I know will take like 6 days. I took 6mg of sub yesterday but still had prob the most intense opiate w/d symptoms of my entire life. I have etizolam  coming in the mail Tuesday, so I'm hoping that can take care of the anxiety so I only have to deal with diarrhea, vomitting.. What do you suggest I do? Subs or immodium?\n",

I'm on my bi-weekly heroin binge which puts me in like fuckin agony if I don't constantly have something sweet to drink (sorry teeth). I grabbed one of these out of my fridge and thought \"why didn't I thjnk of this before?\" They taste fuckin bangin and the minimal alcohol increases nod, w/o being too much.. Idk I'm high and rambling and my gf is bitching about her period so I just wanted someone to talk to without being set on fire. Happy nods today, love you my brothas and sistas 💰💉💊💸🎍\n",

Snorting like barely gets me high anymore. I don't want to switch to the needle, nor have any strong urge to do so. Is plugging worth it and if so, are there any recommendations (like would DXM help at all? Not sure if that only works for oral consumption)? Would perhaps just switching to suboxone for awhile to clean out my system lower my tolerance? It's not a life-threatening situation, it's just annoying not getting as high as I used to ... You guys are great, love you all and thanks I'm advance for anybody willing to offer advice!\n",

His stuff is *meh* and I have other connects but he is the easiest and quickest to get ahold of .. I bickered him down to $40 for 5, but when I look in the ziplock he gave me, I noticed an entire brick. I called him up right away and he glided over on his Hovertrax to correct his mistake.. I know I shouldn't be applauded for not stealing $100-$200 worth of drugs from him, but I could've at least gotten a \"thank you.\" If I made that mistake with a kid I just met, with no idea of his address, social life, or even NAME, I'd certainly kiss it goodbye .. Idk, would anyone else do what I did or would you just say \"finder's keeper's\" ? \n",

You're supposed to leave it dry since the tar is water soluble, but isn't meth (and meth bongs are DEF at least fairly popular) also? I read up on people evaporating their meth bong water and was wondering why people couldn't do this for their bth bong water, as well? In fact, I'd assume all of the non-water soluble cuts would be smoked away (plus lots of plant matter) and you would be left with an even more pure product than you started with.. Or of course, would the heroin be destroyed when it was burned? If anybody has tried this or know someone who has, please let me know because I'm very curious.\n",

I'm on coke, morphine and oxy and was able to slam on the breaks just in time to come to a complete stop. Seeing as how it was dark out and I caught this in the second in-between my nods (I never drive knowingly under the influence but I haven't done oxy in awhile and thought the coke would keep me alert), it's a miracle I was paying attention at that exact second. Right now I'm at my friend's house typing this up so don't worry I'm not /r/opiates - ing and driving lol. Stay safe tonight guys and pay attention to the roads, especially if you've done any drugs. You can drive like dale erndhart (bad example) but all it takes is one inexperienced driver or one asshole that had one too many beers to end up dead or in a wheelchair. For those not concerned about their personal safety, please think of your families. Hope everyone's having a great weekend and pay the fuck attention ! 👮🔫🏃🚔💥😲💵💊🚬😏\n",

As of late, it's been very difficult to walk down/up stairs and stand up because of the pressure on my knee. I'm a healthy and relatively active 22-year-old.. I was thinking about using that website that let's you know which providers in your state prescribe the most of one particular medication.. The doctor in my state (and the next state over) that prescribe the most oxy are PM doctors that have offices relatively close to me. Do you think that I have a decent shot at getting an oxy/hydro script if I visit them? I know there are many factors going on but if I let them know I can't excercise anymore and have mild pain walking (moreso using stairs), would this be enough reason to get a prescription? Idk if most doctors say \"fuck it\" and just wrote a script or if doctors have a long list of clearances to do so. This question is moreso for current/former pain management patients.\n",

In a matter of less than 5 days, I think I made a new personal record.. Seeing as how I can't really afford to do more than these little binges and my connect lives kinda far (it takes four hours for me to cop altogether), I'm gonna have to begin taking subs for awhile.. No real meaning to this post, just kinda bummed.. Since recently beginning a job in digital/print sales, dope has had my sales game on POINT. Hopefully I can get the same results on suboxone (and in the beginning, xanax) but I'm sure that's not the case lol. Happy nods to all and to all a good nod.\n",

More importantly, does anyone have any idea of it's legal status within the US? Some comments I've seen on other forums say that it's perfectly legal, but I have no idea how possession wouldn't be a violation of the analog act (fentanyl is schedule II).\n",

Time for a tolerance break. What's everybody else's habit like?\n",

For weeks on end, I've chased a feeling I can describe only as falling back in love with life. I've spent countless dollars and countless time chasing her warm embrace, only to find disappointment. This love however, demands dedication. The worry and fear of my family, my girlfriend, and even myself.. wondering if I'll ever find another love as sweet and fulfilling. It won't last forever, but these precious moments have become the reason I wake up in the morning. Luck has found me today and now I can sit and wonder.. Was it worth it? Probably not, but would I do it again? What else is there.. My high is great but it seems that this chase is all that brings me satisfaction. I look back on my weeks of effort how many people say they reflect on life.. It wasn't perfect but I wouldn't do it any other way. Just this once, I pray, that this feeling lasts forever. If everyone I knew that was so scared to even mention it's name just gave it a try, maybe they would understand? It'll never happen, but in these few hours where I'm under this spell I can picture my wildest dreams and not even care that they'll never come true.. Just this once, please don't go away.\n",

For sniffers, which order do you guys use (dope then coke or coke then dope) ? My stamps are roughly .05 so what dosage do you guys use as well?\n",

They're 300mg pills.. He said he'd offer \"like 20 of them\" which makes me reaaaally question their street value. I live in the northeast so basically, what would you guys value 300mg gabapentin at? I gotta kno fast tho so hopefully I get an answer or two by 6:15PM EST.\n",

In the article, it said that a slang term for Opana is \"new blues.\" If this indicates that opana is starting to become more popular, then I am very concerned for young people in our country. Opana is probably my favorite drug but it is also so dangerous. Roxies are dangerous too but not **nearly** as easy to OD on.. So yeah, my first thought when I saw that \"new blues\" term was \"awesome, Opana must be becoming more popular\" but my immediate after-thought was \"a lot of kids are gonna die.\" I'm really hoping that this expression was just a shock tactic from Huffington Post because regardless of how awesome Pandas are, I'd much rather they stay off the street and keep less kids out of caskets.\n",

Additionally, I keep my hair short and don't have any track marks (I sniff) so I've been asked this question just about every time I've met a new hook.. Does anyone else have this problem (fucking specific, I know) ? Additionally, does the consensus think it looks less suspicious to cops that I'm dressed up or would it just look like I'm even more out of place?\n",

YARD SALES, BiTCHES. Seriously tho, it's next Sunday and most moms care about that shit even if they say they don't. Most towns have a classified paper that lists where yard/garage sales are in your neighborhood that weekend. IME, they're usually Friday - Sunday, 8-2 with peak hours being between 8am and 11am. Lots of things are 50 cents so even if you scrape together some change, odds are that you'll find at least a necklace and a card from the dollar store. Happy nods, brethren.\n",

In comparison, almost every white person I've gotten my dope from has an enormous habit. White people use drugs and black people use drugs, but for some reason (and I know I'm not alone in this), I feel more confident that my dealer doesn't use and won't do some shady shit like sell me empty bags if they're African-American. As jerry Seinfeld would say, what's the deal with that?\n",

Now this guy lives about an hour away from me and I'm not particularly familiar with the highway I take to get back. Questioning if I'm traveling the right direction, I pull off the highway into a dunkin donuts and charge my phone. Apparently I missed my exit so rather than head back up the highway to get to my exit, I decide to take a more scenic route home. TOP ROW (left to right): 1. Scenic Route 80, 2. My delicious fuckin sandwich (bacon, egg &amp; cheese), 3. Morris County, 4. Budd Lake. BOTTOM ROW (left to right): 1. Guinness record holder: World's dopest sit-down Chinese joint, 2. Warren County, 3. Historic Washington Theatre (est. 1926), 4. Stamp I picked up, \"HIGH ROLLER\" - Typical quality for any north Jersey stamp.. Tbh, might've even been on the lower side but that is made up for by how huge the stamp is.. Not something I'd be particularly excited about, but worth the price I paid for it (about $7/per). This post is dedicated in loving sympathy to all those convinced that New Jersey is made up of only the shore and the Garden State Parkway.

BUT, my homeboy helped me cop two buns of some north Jersey FIRE yesterday (\"halftime\" .. Two hockey sticks written in red print, straight from Brick City, NJ).. Cheapest buns I've ever purchased, quickest deal I've ever experienced, and only one cop out of the thousands of cars I saw. Currently, I get to chill the fuck out in the AP chemistry class I'm subbing for and just bullshit with the kids. I guess it's the little things that make life worth living after all.. I smell the weekend coming guys so keep your stress levels low and re-up money highhh ......................... P.S. If you live in the northeast, please get the FUCK outside and enjoy this beautiful weather. Also, shout out to the neezy who greatly improved my weekend's living conditions :)\n",

Does anyone know where I could perhaps find DEA information for the types of heroin found in seizures / traffic stops? Someone I know said that when he got popped for a distribution charge, his paperwork specifically said \"heroin #4.\"\n",

One is a good friend from college, the other is a friend of a friend. I've never had any gangsta dealers or anything before, just known other users. How'd y'all meet your guys ?\n",

I wondered for awhile if it was just the improved confidence that made me assume I was singing better but I've recorded the same songs both sober and buzzin and I definitely can hit a wider range of notes  while slightly inebriated (the raspiness also makes my voice sound much less whiny).. Anyone agree?\n",

I may have as little as 6 days to get clean for this test. I'm currently withdrawing on poppy seed tea, but that's the least of my worries as I'm sure it will be all out by then.. Does anyone have any kind of experience to a similar scenario? It's for a job so i'm sure I can drink a lot of water the day before to dilute it but idk man, definitely worries me that I wouldn't be surprised if it's lab-tested.\n",

My only hope is that my package of poppy seeds arrives in the mail and keeps me well. I'm currently subbing at the high school I used to go to and would love to punch one of these little shits in the face but would probably start crying and shit myself before I landed the punch. Here's to a miracle phone call or a mailbox full of poppy seeds when I get home in an hour. Cheers.\n",

Depending on how big the current heroin epidemic gets, I see buprenephorine gum and patches being produced and doctors not having to be paid hundreds of dollars to prescribe them.. Idk about them being OTC but hey, a guy can dream lol.\n",

She took a vike 5 when she got home and proceeded to go from sobbing to laughing to giving me a hug over the course of 30 seconds. Being on opi's the same time as your mom sounds fun until I become her chauffeur (she doesn't want a DUI) thinking, \"Damn gurl u trippin'.\"\n",

Has anyone noticed a DRAMATIC drop in quality this week? One half pound package used to have me gone. Until this week. I've noticed a lot more anxiety and no euphoria whatsoever. I used to be high for two hours and at least WELL for 12+. I dosed a pound of well shaken tea this morning at 7AM (twice my normal dose) and was in agonizing withdrawals by 2PM. I've noticed a lot more red seeds (as compared to blue) and at least a 75% drop in quality from at just last week. PST users that use this brand.. Has anyone else noticed this?\n",

As far as anyone with experience goes, how long after this four day period should it take for me to pass a UA for a job?\n",

Aside from meaning that it would not show up as a benzo on a drug test, it is also not an analog of a schedule I or II drug (making it exempt from the analog act). Before hydrocodone became schedule II, don't you think someone would make a hydrocodone analog, as it would be an unscheduled and thus, a legal substance? Obviously that's irrelevant now but does anyone know why there are no opiate RC's? I feel like that would have been EXTREMELY lucrative if it was manufactured and distributed a couple months ago. On a side note, does anyone think etizolam is safe or have any experience with it?\n",

In the event that it's 7, or 9, I'd like to avoid benzos for w/d.. I've read up on etizolam since it's not a benzo and was wondering if anyone has experience w/ it or know which direction to look for reputable vendors? I'm not really familiar w/ bitcoin but I have enough cash to pay on the more expensive side if it means better stealth or can come in pill form.. Also, does anyone think that suboxone would come up on most pre-employment drug screens? Full or partial answers could potentially be life changing so please help!\n",

For anyone else in the northeast within an eyeshot of a window right now, it's pretty clear that copping tomorrow may be perilous. I do have in my posession, however, one bag of poppy seeds that I may produce concentrated flake opium out of. If all works out, I'm probably going to try and plug some of it to take advantage of the higher bioavailability. If I do so, would you recommend that I filter it? From what I understand, shooting anything without filtering is very hazardous. Does plugging follow the same rules of preparation?\n",

Should I take it when peaking or wait until the PST high comes down? I just don't want to take the bag when I'm peaking and feel nothig extra from the bag bc I only have one left. Anyone have any experience from mixing the two?\n",

I'm thinking about replacing the lemon juice with instant coffee to reduce the amount of liquid I have to drink in the morning. Does anyone have any experience with this or think it would negatively affect the extraction process?\n",

Got to cop the second I got out of work and this shit was some FIRE (daily news stamp). Not sure how strict the location rule is if it's in regards to cities or just streets/neighborhoods but of all places I got this it was fuckin New Brunswick which anyone in Jersey should know is never a good thing in regards to quality or price.\\n\\nGot beat twice this week but was rewarded with awesome dope in the most unlikely of places. As the saying goes, the best revenge is self-improvement.\\n\\nP.S. Got to produce a bowel movement today for the first time in a week which may have honestly produced more relief than any opiate euphoria I've ever experienced.\\n\\nHappy nods!\n",

I proceed to be sold bunk shit for $40 Sunday and four bags short of a bun today for $70.. I ended up selling a bag to my friend so grand total I ended up with 5 low-average quality stamps for $100 this week. If anyone knows some painless suicide methods or wants to donate some stamps to A.A.S.S. (Addicts Against Scumbags Selling), feel free to share.\n",

Does anyone have any suggestions on how I could go about this?\n",
