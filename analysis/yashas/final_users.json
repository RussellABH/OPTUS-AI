I\u2019ve been on methadone for like 9 months. Clean just as long. I\u2019ve been really struggling lately and sure enough I\u2019m at my dudes house picking up a bag. \n\nBut I had a question. If I have been doing well at the clinic will they take away my take homes? I\u2019m on phase 2 which means I get 3 bottles on Thursday and I\u2019m set to phase up in a few weeks. \n\nWill a relapse take away my bottles?","1":"I was just served by a debt collector today. \n\nThankfully I already had a plan to file bankruptcy. \n\nOf course even tho I\u2019m clean and I\u2019m doing okay, I can barely afford to eat, so my mom is lending me the money to file. \n\nMan, I finally get my shit together and the universe still likes kicking me in the balls. \n\nHas anyone else here ever filled for bankruptcy after getting clean??","2":"I\u2019ve been getting crazy cravings lately. I don\u2019t know what it is. I\u2019ve been on 105mg of methadone since July 20th and haven\u2019t really wanted to use much. But lately... I\u2019ve been thinking about it. \n\nMy life isn\u2019t great by any means. BUT I\u2019m not homeless or waking up sick. \n\nThere have been a few posts in a FB support group for users who\u2019ve relapsed after years clean. \n\nIdk. I just rented Ben Is Back on amazon because I have the money to do shit like that again lol a shame wow it was awesome. \n\nOh and yesterday was my 29th birthday. ","3":"So I\u2019ve been clean for most of the last year since rehab last winter. \n\nI\u2019m doing well, have a job, have steady income, on methadone, but that\u2019s it. \n\nI\u2019m a 28yo gay guy that\u2019s been  single for basically ever... and I\u2019m afraid my life isn\u2019t going to get much better than this. \n\nDating as a gay guy is already hard as it is, and for the most part people are really encouraging about my recovery (I\u2019m always upfront about recovery before we even go on a date)\n\nBut I have to deal with the rejection without using, and I\u2019ve been rejected SO much that it\u2019s not even a reason to use. \n\nIf this is all my life, I don\u2019t know what the point of getting clean was. ","4":"Yesterday I ran into an old dealer after a few years. He\u2019s now working full time, has a hot girlfriend, and he just bought  a fucking house. \n\nI haven\u2019t been clean as long as him but I only make $10\/hr part time, I can\u2019t afford to date, and I\u2019m never going to make enough to buy a house.  \n\nPeople are always like LIFE IS AMAZING SOBER. \n\nWell fuck you. No it\u2019s not. The least shitty part of my day is taking my methadone because of the buzz. Other than that I sleep for as long as I can. \n\nThis is simply how my life is going to be no matter how much clean time I get. I\u2019m not going to wake up one day to a raise. Not happening. \n\nThis is just me, isn\u2019t it?","5":"Does anyone else struggle with being clean sometimes?\n\nGreat jobs tend to fall into my lap, and the most recent is a job at Facebook HQ, doing \u201canything I want\u201d they said. But I\u2019m nervous because if I get my dream job, start making 6 figures, and I\u2019m lonely as hell... that\u2019s a recipe for disaster. I haven\u2019t told Facebook yes or no yet. \n\nThe other issue is that my ex lives within driving distance of Palo Alto, and I\u2019m still madly in love with him and I always will be, so I\u2019ll be tempted to make a fool of myself because he made it clear it was over. \n\n\n","6":"I have a very marketable career,  but I keep fucking it up. I\u2019m so ready for the next shot to take me out. \n\nNothing it criticism for how so..? Idk. Not even really any party ","7":"Hey so I recently got on methadone and I was wondering if drug tests (rapid) can tell the difference between methadone and other opiates?\n\nLike, if I popped for opiates would that be expected because I\u2019m on methadone, and if I were to relapse,the rapid tests wouldn\u2019t know the difference?\n\nThanks. ","8":"So I found a thread in a huge FB group (you've probably seen it -- they ban you for mentioning Kratom, and hate harm reduction)\n\nThis woman, who's OBVIOUSLY never used before, tried to tell us all what caused endocarditis...\n\n\" endocarditis is when the tiny fibers of cotton eventually clog the valve of the heart and causes and infection that can lead to needing a heart valve replacement, biological or mechanical. Think of your drain getting clogged with hair.\"\n\nI tried to tell her that's VERY WRONG. and she replied, \"I respectfully disagree\"\n\nBITCH YOU CANT DISAGREE WITH SCIENCE.","9":"I've now had 3 shots, most recently last Thursday, but last Monday I picked up a bag... roughly 25 days after my 2nd shot. \n\nAccording to science all anecdotal reports, I should've felt NOTHING. Especially with the .2 shot I did.\n\nBut no, I got higher than I've been in 5 years. If I broke thru, I have no idea how.\n\nNaltrexone DOES lower opiate tolerance, which explains why I was puking my brains out but it doesn't explain why it didn't block the shot.\n\nI also did some on Sunday... 3 days after shot #3 and while I didn't feel anything super strong, I did get a nice mood boost, and a little of the warm tingles.\n\nThere's also something else worth considering ... Since I did some on that Monday, and my shot was on Thursday, I should've popped for dope at the doctor, but my UA was 100% clean. From the results I saw, it doesnt look like they test for fent or its analogues... In fact the only opiate on the list is morphine.\n\nSo maybe I got a super potent fent analogue that cuts through naltrexone like butter?\n\nWhat do you guys think?","10":"So 3 days ago I posted about how awesome my life was. Well, apparently a lot can happen in 3 days.\n\nSo I\u2019m 1200 miles from home until next Tuesday with my boyfriend, right? Well last night he basically called it off. While I\u2019m 1200 miles away from home.\n\nHe said he\u2019s not ready for a guy (we\u2019re gay) in his life at this point and he thought he was. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s learning more about himself, but I wished it wouldn\u2019t have been at my expense. I didn\u2019t see this coming a million miles away. I can\u2019t help but laugh because I should be so used to shit like this happening to me, but it always blindsides me. Maybe I should actually listen when I tell myself to not get involved. Dating is such a waste of time lol\n\nI got really drunk last night and a friend of his held me while I cried. This is why I don\u2019t drink, I embarrass myself.\n\nHad I not been on the shot, getting high would be the first thing on my mind. And honestly, I\u2019m half tempted to see if I can break through the shot. Yeah I know the risks, but I\u2019m past the point of caring.\n\nI gues whenever your life looks perfect, and its too good to be true? It probably is.","11":"I\u2019m still alive and still clean. 136 days to be exact. \n\nOn Friday I graduated from my halfway house, moved into a new apartment, flew to somewhere warm for 10 days to be with my boyfriend, AND as I was waiting for the plane I got a call from a company i interviewed at saying they\u2019re offering me a job. \n\nI think this tI\u2019ve it\u2019s gonna stick. Hopefully. I\u2019m on Vivitrol this time and not subs. \n\nI hope you\u2019re all well. This place has been there for me during all my crazy ups and downs and I wanted to share how well I\u2019m doing. \n\n\u2764\ufe0f","12":"Hey everyone! I\u2019m doing the recovery thing again. I\u2019m back up to 77 days. \n\nI\u2019m on naltrexone now instead of subs. It handles my cravings easily 10x better. \n\nBut since I\u2019m not on a narcotic all my chronic joint pain is rushing back. It sucks. But I stand by my decision. \n\nI hope you\u2019re all well \u2764\ufe0f","13":"I slipped after like 7 months of sobriety on subs, after my state insurance was taken over by a new work insurance that my sub doc didn't take.\n\nBut that's not why I'm here. I need to talk to someone that's not my fam.\n\nRewind to August 2011, My Grandma (mom's mom) leaves my mother a NASTY voicemail out of the blue telling her what a shitty mother she is, and to leave, and never come back.\n\nThat was a gut punch. My mom was adopted, and you DONT TREAT ADOPTED KIDS OR OTHERWISE THAT WAY.\n\nAlso, my Grandma was my rock, I mean weekly phone calls for YEARS. I told her everything, vice versa. Until my mom played me the voicemail.\n\nI'm FIERCELY loyal to my mother. She's put up my with my addiction, being homeless, going to jail, there's nothing I can do to push her away. So I took my moms \"side\" and never spoke to my grandma (or grandpa, because he never once apologized for her) ever again.\n\nIt made me really said over the years, and they both recently passed between July - Sept. It was a shock.\n\nThey had a large estate, and my mom, and my brothers all assumed we were taken out of the will.\n\nDRUMROLL PLEASE....................\n\nMy aunt told us today that my brothers and I (NOT my mom) will be getting an inheritance. We're just stunned. Absolutely stunned. My little brother told me his \"heart hurts so much\" and mine does too, because we never TRIED to reconcile. I mean, I don't regret supporting my mom, she supports me daily, but taking us out of the will was never even DISCUSSED. and we cut off all contact, and NOW, getting this money means 2 people who never stopped loving us are gone, and we can't fix it.\n\nI have to stop now, because if they ask why I'm sniffling at my desk, I'll have to come up with something and I can't even think right now.\n\nWhat is a barely-sober addict like me going to do with an inheritance I really, really thought was out of the question??","14":"Hey people. heard about \/u\/timbf. that makes me so sad.\n\nJust made me miss this community of lovely people.\n\nI thought I'd just poke in an say I'm still alive, and still clean!

Working from home full-time, as a web developer, and spending time with my family.\n\nToday is my 27th birthday. This time last year, my addiction started driving my life into the ground. I ended up living in my boyfriends car for 5 months before entering treatment. Being homeless, hungry, and withdrawing is a position I NEVER want to be in again.\n\n Just the simple fact that I'm clean now, and working on my life, showed my dad he can trust me to live in his house again.\n\nMy boyfriend are no longer together, but hes better off. He has a decent job, and living with his parents almost 12 hours away.\n\nI spent 3 years high on anything I could touch, but Suboxone has given me my life back.

Same combination.\n\nHe said he'd use in moderation, but with fent, and it's analogues, moderation is often fatal.\n\nIt makes me so sad. These kids just got their degrees. Not even 23.\n\nIf you use ECP, even every once in a while, please understand the danger you're in. Your tolerance is too low to save you from carfentanil. No matter what.\n\nI've seen an almost fatal overdose from snorting a small line, and that's even with frequent use. It doesn't happen immediately, but within 5 minutes, he was purple. He thought the small line he did was safe. Nothing is safe with fentanyl. No ROA. NOTHING.\n\nPlease, I beg you, stop.\n\nThe people you leave behind are left with so much guilt and sadness, you couldn't possibly understand. \n\nI only have texts and Facebook messages from my friends because they thought they were safe with snorting.\n\nI really miss my friends.\n\n\n","20":"No, not that waiting \n\nSince I was arrested, I've stayed clean, got all my court ordered shit done, and my PO is very happy.\n\nIm waiting to hear back about my chemical assessment. Known as a rule 25 in MN. Its used to decide what kind of treatment I need. Since im homeless, i really want an inpatient rehab with methadone or subs. I should find out hopefully tomorrow or Monday.\n\nI can get started on methadone the minute the assessment is approved.\n\nIll be staying with my mom for a few days, while I wait for the call.\n\nOn the plus side, ive been clean 2 weeks tomorrow.","21":"Friday night I was arrested. 5th degree possession. \n\nThank God Minnesota dropped it down to a gross misdemeanor instead of a felony as of August 1st. I'm lucky. \n\nI am still in withdrawals. \n\nIt also started Thursday when I got some with a friend. Ended up hitting him with a shot of a sub strip to save his life. \n\nThe same batch almost killed another friend after he snorted a single line. This leads me to believe that fent is everywhere here. Also,  the tar here doesn't even get me high anymore,  and only fent would raise my tolerance so high.\n\nI don't know how I'm going to comply with probation while living in a car when it's going to snow shortly. ","22":"How I went from having a successful career at 23 to being homeless,  and living in my car,  eating  only every few days,  at age 26,  is foreign and mind-boggling to normal people. \n\nBut we are not normal. \n\nI used to have things. Nice things. A nice apartment,  a new car,  the newest toys,  treating my mom to an expensive vacation every summer. Now I'm sleeping on the floor on her apartment a few days a week  and sleeping in my car the other half. \n\nHow I got here doesn't matter,  because lightning doesn't strike twice. \n\nThere is no repairing things I've broken. \n\nI got lucky with my career the first time around. That won't happen again. \n\nI have no brighter future, because I'm living my future. This is where my life was supposed to go,  how I was supposed to end up. \n\nAt least at this point,  I have nothing to worry about anymore. Things literally can't get any worse. \n\nMy mom came into the room and starting sobbing,  saying  she can't support me,  and that I have to figure something out. And that she's been so depressed lately because she feels so guilty. \n\nSo,  in the morning,  before she wakes up,  I'm leaving. I don't know where I'm going but at this point I'm done. I give up. Heroin wins. I can't keep trying anymore. There is no point in getting a minimum wage job because using what little energy I have to work my ass off,  for  a small percentage of what I used to make, is more upsetting to me than sleeping in my car. \n\nIt bears repeating,  if you're thinking of trying opiates,  or graduating to heroin,  DONT.  Unless you want this post to be you in a few years. My life is over. I'll never,  ever get it back. There's nothing I can do to ever be happy again. I wouldn't want this for my worst enemy. \n\nMy family cries for me,  my friends are to stressed to even worry about me anymore. \n\nI quite literally have nothing left. \n\nLet my life be a lesson for those who chip,  or are thinking about starting. \n\nMy life is not a life you want,  trust me. Waking up every morning is like being tortured slowly every single day. ","23":"So just this morning I got my Oregon state refund. Still waiting on another state but I'm so happy for this $200.

It'll be possible,  if I don't pick up \n\nBut I want a bag so bad. If I picked up,  I'd be totally broke,  and be right back in the same spot in 2 days. \n\nIf I took the 10 days and stopped,  I save the money for food and gas, and I take a tolerance break. The dope will there when I want it. My dealer isn't going anywhere. \n\nSo why am I panicking?? Taking a break will do nothing but good. My veins will at least partially rebound in that time, too. Ugh. \n\nWhy am I getting drugs when I'm living in my car? Because I can't stop. \n\nI even have subs so I won't even be sick. \n\nI just have to be patient. \n\nWe're going back to my moms place for the week. I'll have a place to relax,  and sleep. \n\nI might start writing,  or working on some projects,  or Netflix. \n\nThe dope around here is finally real. It's been so good,  and not fent shit. Bad time to stop. Or the perfect time. ","25":"We've been staying with my mom the last month or so. \n\nI managed to nail an awesome job,  get a place all setup.. Then job lost. I'm not sure why,  as I was behaving myself. Showing up early,  etc. \n\nIt's like,  no matter what happens,  I always fail. \n\nWith my final paycheck,  that was supposed to go toward rent for out new place,  I used it to go HARD on speedballs with the hope that my heart would stop. I mean,  I was doing a lot of crack. I mean,  a lot. It didn't work,  so now I'm laying around in the same clothes everyday,  maybe I'll eat,  but I just sit on Netflix. \n\nIm currently watching Scandal,  it's made the last week go by really fast. I'm just so tired of everything. I don't have the energy to even move these days. \n\nThings will never get better,  I've tried and gotten nowhere.

Friends and dealers are more than happy to buy you food,  let you shower, etc. \n\nThats fucked up. No? \n\nAfter a REALLY big fight with my mom today,  she's letting us come over. That's usually how it goes. Screaming. Crying. Over it. \n\nThis is why I can't do this anymore. Ugh. ","27":"I honestly thought I'd never write on of these,  but here I am,  sobbing at my desk because Kevin was just tagged in a RIP post on Facebook. \n\nIt's true. \n\nKevin died last Sunday,  and I'm trying to figure out why. \n\nWe got pretty close over the last 2 years. He was always careful about never shooting up. To my knowledge he never did. \n\nBut the last 2 times I saw him,  he was completely blacked out on dope and benzos. He was puking,  and half asleep in the car 2 weeks ago when we picked up. \n\nHE JUST GRADUATED FROM FUCKING COLLEGE AND JUST STARTED A JOB. FUCK. \n\nHe last text me Saturday,  looking to score. I told him I couldn't help him. Apparently he found some anyway. \n\nIm not sure if drugs were involved,  waiting to hear back still,  but I'm almost positive it was a fatal mix of benzos and fent laced dope. \n\nIm so sad. Fuck,  I'm so sad. He'd text me when I'd make a post here,  asking if I was okay. Every time. \n\nNow,  I'm not okay. \n\nFuck this game. I'm out. I can't do this. \n\n***PSA: HIS DEATH WAS CAUSED BY A COMBINATION OF FENT,  BENZOS,  AND ALCOHOL. Even if you don't shoot,  fent is dangerous! Snorting will not save your life. ***","28":"So,  been living out of my car for like 2 weeks now. It's not terrible. I've been getting high a ton,  which helps me cope. Then I just spend all day in a coffee shop,  with wifi,  so it's not a huge deal \n\nSo yesterday,  a recruiter I've been working with told me a company wanted to interview me in an hour. It was a really fast turn around. I had to get ready fast,  and prepare. \n\nI ended up nailing the interview and I start the job on Friday!!! \n\nNot sure how I'm going to maintain this job while homeless,  but... I have to because it pays well enough that I'll be able to get a nice place after a few weeks. \n\nThings are slowly starting to get better. \n\nMy relationship with my parents is shit,  but once I start building my life back,  and getting my shit together they cant say shut about my use. ","29":"When I was in the PNW, I had these 2 older dudes who sold together. They'd either give m a ride to work, give me bus money, and even front me so I could work. All without ever bugging me about payment. I paid them back each time, but man, it was so cool.\n\nMy dude back home now, I've known him the longest. When my sister died, he sat in my car, let me cry, turned off his phone, and gave m a bunch of dope. We even just talked about that night 2 days ago. He was like, \"dude, that was deep. If you ever need anything I'm here. You're a little destructive. You're still a good guy.\"","30":"A few years ago, I slipped on some ice after work. Think cartoon banana peel. It probably looked hilarious.\n\nI hurt my back really bad. Scheduled a dr appooint with my friends moms doctor because she said shes \"sympathetic to pain\" hint, hint.\n\nI met this doctor for the first time, and after a 10-minute check up, she gave me a script for 45x 5mg Percocet, and a bunch of Flexeril. FANTASTIC. Went back a week later, and got a pain contract.. for tramadol. I took it, but never refilled it. It's garbage.\n\nSo fast-forward to yesterday, my boyfriend can barely move. Hes been complaining about back pain that's getting worse everyday. I take him to the ER, thinking he'll get a one-offf script for oxy or something, and some muscle relaxers. Just like I did.\n\nNOPE.\n\n***I fucking took him to the same ER where they treated his fent OD like 5 days prior. I didn't even THINK about that.***\n\nThey said, \"we'd usually give something for pain, but you'll just have to make due with this\" (Flexeril)\n\nGODDAMIT.\n\nSo yeah, don't go to the same hospital for pain meds, where they've treated you for an OD.","31":"Just a heads up,  all of the ECP in the Minneapolis area is just all fent now. It's very,  very rare that you'll get real dope. \n\nThe area is known for having lots of fent,  but now its basically replaced heroin completely. \n\nUnless you get tar. Tar is legit. \n\nPlease be careful. ","32":"So last night,  my boyfriend prepped a shot. Nothing he hasn't done before. And not any more than he's done before. \n\nHe was unconscious within 15 seconds. His eyes closed and he fell forward. \n\nHe didn't totally stop breathing,  but with his sleep apnea,  his airway gets obstructed. So he was suffocating himself. \n\nWe didn't have any narcan,  so I called 911 and kept breathing for him until the ambulance got there. \n\nHad I not breathed for him,  he would have died. \n\nBecause of the overdose  we were kicked out of the place we were staying. \n\nOh,  and after, 3 days the company I started work for decided I wasn't getting tasks done fast enough and let me go. (the recruiter said it wasn't even my fault. He believes the company has unrealistic expectations) \n\nSo,  my boyfriend almost died,  we got kicked out,  and I don't have a job. \n\nWe slept in the car last night,  and probably will for some time. \n\nIm thankful for the vodka I have. Maybe I can drink my self unconscious today. Because fuck everything. I'm done. I give up.

I love surprise come-ups.\n\nSo, that whole getting clean thing...  Nope. Oh well. ","39":"From September - December I was clean. Like 90 some odd days. Then I got a job and spent what little money I had getting high. Not only did I get high,  but I brought someone down with me. \n\nTomorrow that changes. We've spent the last month getting high basically everyday. I already  feel guilty enough for dragging people through my shit. \n\nMost of you will understand that drugs are the single reason I have for not killing myself. It's true. But as of tomorrow,  I won't have drugs to rely on. So,  I don't know how I'll handle it. The thirst for no longer being here is stronger than urge to get high. It's something that eats at you until the second you fall asleep. \n\nBut tomorrow,  I'm going to try to ignore those urges. Try to create some semblance of a normal life. Not for me,  for everyone around me. \n\nYou guys have brought me so much joy and companionship through some really awful times,  and while I might be a lurker every so often,  you'll see my name less and less,  and you may have even noticed my absence lately. \n\nIm hoping this clean shit will work... For my families sake. They're now the only reason I'm still here. \n\nIf I make it to a year or so clean,  I'll pop in,  otherwise,  see ya later :)","40":"So,  this weird thing has happened to me twice now and it doesn't make any sense. \n\nSometimes when I register,  it's a darker red,  with not too much force,  not foamy,  and no pain as I push the plunger so you'd think it's a vein, right? \n\nNo,  I just hit an artery. But all the signs said vein.  I don't get it.  Didn't even notice it wasn't a vein until my arm got super itchy,  then major histamine reaction. \n\nDoes anyone else sometimes see arteries that by all description should be veins?","41":"I just started an 11 hour drive to Minnesota.

What could possibly be the reason nature and evolution decided to attach the physical dependence aspect to opiates.

Got a lead position at a huge financial company in Minneapolis. \n\nThen I got a job offer last May in Portland. \n\nAfter a few months of binges, and ODs, I ran out my welcome in Portland and lost my job. Was almost homeless (if you remember that part)\n\nSince September I've been in Michigan and working a part time job. I've only used twice in the last 4 months. Being cleans not so bad, except how suicidal I get some days.\n\nBut now I have the opportunity to move back to MN, my home town. So much goddamn moving lol. But this time I could take my time to find a job I want, and clear my head.  \n\nI noticed I definitely visit this sub a lot less when I'm clean. \n\nJust thought I'd say hi.","45":"For me,  at least,  2015 can suck dick.

God damn. \n\nLet's have a better 2016 (doubtful) \n\nWhat are your plans tonight?","46":"After my week-long binge\/relapse I kinda decided using consistently again just isn't worth it. I do wanna try getting high,  but through other methods. I'm excited to try PST again,  maybe even some U-4770 or whatever it's called.\n\nBut I think it would be cool to try Kratom for once. Especially with no tolerance,  it should get me nice and high. \n\nAnyone have any recommended strains,  etc?

I don't have a car,  and the nearest place to pick up is 2 hours away. I'll just work as much as I can and maybe eventually play with those fent analogues while I can (Oh I know,  they're dangerous,  blah blah blah.  Haha) \n\nI want to get high,  but I don't need to. \n\nI've just spent so much of the last few months CHOOSING to hate being sober. It's exhausting. Haha.

I ordered a couple New York stamps from the darknet, and they arrived without issue.\n\nI remember the day more vividly than almost any other occasion. I know the exact date because it was the day before the Minneapolis Pride parade, and I was excited about my first couple stamps for the weekend.\n\nI was at my apartment in a Minneapolis suburb when the mail came. I could hardly open the package, I was so excited.\n\nI cut up a nice line, and up it went. My immediate thought was, verbatim, \"It feels just like Vicodin. That's it? Boring.\"\n\nNot 10 minutes after I did my very first line of dope, my mom arrives with  groceries and asks me to help get them. I enthusiastically agreed. It was, to this day, the most fun I've ever had unloading groceries.\n\nAfterwards, I went on a long walk. None of my friends were around but it was really sunny out so I wanted to be outside. Best. Walk. Ever.\n\nI don't think I've ever been that happy. It was scary. I didn't even get nauseous until like the 3rd or 4th day of consecutive use.\n\nAfter my walk, I went home and put on a history documentary, and did a few more lines. At this point I was nodding hardcore and I ended up falling asleep for 4 hours. During my nap I had the SCARIEST DREAM EVER. There was this dark red demon chasing me. I had heard of opiate nightmares, but man, that felt so real. It was the only time heroin ever gave me nightmares, though.\n\nI slept well that night.\n\nI spent the next couple months making bigger and bigger orders of stamps, successfully chipping for a while even. Even ordered some awesome DMT I smoked with a friend.\n\nLater on I found reddit (namely, this sub) but I can't remember HOW I found it. Ended up finding a local connect, and, well, the rest is history.\n\nDoes anyone else remember details about their very first time? Do you remember the day? I can't believe how many details I can play in my head of that day.","53":"I video chatted with my family since I'm in another state,  and my mom's friend says,  \"it's good to see you're awake this year! I'm glad you're doing better,  we miss you.\" \n\nSure I'm a couple months clean,  but I'm in NO way \"better\" than I was. I hate everything and it's only getting worse. The main thought in my head is how much everything sucks and how much I would give to not be here anymore.\n\nI put on a smile,  and everyone seemed to think I'm doing so much better but I'm not. \n\nWhen does sobriety start feeling better? \n\nI just keep wishing I'll fall asleep and not wake up. \n\nThat is not better. At all.","54":"\"Oh, look at this! On this day, in the past, you had friends, a nice car, went on vacation, had a killer job, and even chipped without it getting in the way!

I've stopped looking at them.","55":"Excuse my rant, I'm drunk.\n\nI've been clean since September 18th. Not a mg of dope, or any opiate, since. Most clean-time since June 2013.\n\nI've been having a really hard time with my living situation.\n\nI'm 25, usually a software engineer and now I'm living with my boyfriends parents and just got a job at McDonald's just for SOMETHING. Since I don't know my way around, and I don't have a car, I had to take anything. Yesterday I was a breakdown from blowing my head off (well, not completely true, but close)\n\nI hate being clean, I hate being broke.\n\nBut... I am not homeless like I thought I'd be. I'm not hungry, I'm not worrying about being sick as fuck. I'm clean, fed, stable, and I have a job. Why am I so ungrateful, and why do I have this massive ego like just because I used to make $30\/hr it means I'm too good to make $8.15\/hr (cry...)\n\nI spend all day drinking FAR too much caffeine, smoking too much weed, and WAY too many cigarettes..\n\nIt's about to get cold as hell which means my seasonal depression will REALLY test my sobriety and push it to it's limits.\n\nI have a few friends offering to get me back to my hometown. If m boyfriend wasn't in the picture, I'd be back in  MN, which means I'd be using again. So, while I want to, I also... don't want to. IDK, fuck.\n\nFor the moment, I'm taking my booze-given motivation and working on my game.

TOMORROW IT IS!**","63":"This feels like a total noob question and I apologize. \n\nBasically a month clean,  but in the next week I'm getting some seeds. Hopefully this weekend even. \n\nWould 2 pounds be too much if the seeds are decent? \n\nSorry for asking a dumb question.","64":"At least a dozen 6.5oz bottles of clearly unwashed poppy seeds for $4 each. \n\nThat means i can go down the street and get 1.2lb for $12. \n\nNo shipping. No waiting. \n\nYesssssss","65":"I've been gaining some clean time by isolating myself the last few weeks as you probably know. It's been a nice tolerance break. \n\nThings are really stressful where I'm at and I'm constantly on edge which is why... when a check for me comes in the mail (YAY MONEY) later this week I'm getting high off my ass with PST.\n\nOr maybe some benzos. Probably weed, too.\n\nI just can't sit around with nothing flooding my brain. I've actually been doing okay without sticking a needle in my arm, I just need SOMETHING.\n\n&lt;3","66":"While I'm sitting around doing nothing, I've been wanting to get high like nothing else. But today is a little different. \n\nBoyfriends mom gave me weed and xanax. I really missed my namesake drugs :)\n\nThat'd all I guess. Haha, I'm just really happy to not be stone sober.","67":"As I sit around doing absolutely nothing with my days (just for now, I hope) I've been wondering why being clean is SO hard.\n\nI think it's because I never expected to live this long, so I have no idea what to do with myself now. Just looking around like, \"uhhhh, what now?\"\n\nOh, and here's a tip for addicts who are using or just getting clean: Do NOT date non-users. They just don't understand and it only causes stress, and you'll be bitched at, even when you're getting clean. They'll nitpick every part of your reddit posts and demand you talk about every part. Ugh.\n\nI don't want to be clean, I'm not ready but I have no choice.","68":"Been clean for 2 weeks today and I HATE IT. I'm so bored I'd give anything to get high... but it probably won't be happening for quite some time which is probably a good thing.\n\nSince I don't have a car, or job, and I'm living in a really small town with my boyfriend and his parents, I have nothing to do at ALL.\n\nIt's also difficult to pretend to be \"fine\" in front of everybody when in reality I just wanna cry all day long.\n\nDo your next shot\/line\/smoke for me :D\n\n**Edit: Might be making a new account to post this stuff under... boyfriend keeps reading my stuff when all I wanna do is post about it, not talk about it.**","69":"So I'm 24 hours away from officially living with my boyfriends parents. I am terrified because I know what it means. \n\nIt means I'm starting over. I had an awesome life, and was mostly content. Until I wasn't. \n\nIn the last 30 hours I've begun waking up from my drug induced coma and its not pretty at all. Just sitting here with my thoughts is slowly KILLING me. \n\nI've realized that while all my friends had their shit together they all got married, had babies, and are farther along in their career than I am. Even if I kicked ass I couldn't catch up. That's a nasty pill to swallow. I'm nowhere near accomplishing anything. \n\nThe hard part won't be staying clean, it will be finding the motivation to start over. I haven't found it on this bus yet. I wanna run away at every stop. I don't even know if I CAN get what I lost. If I can, I don't even know where to start. \n\nHow do you find the motivation to give a shit? Because at present, I don't.","70":"So after being on this bus for 9 hours with a few days clean, I've realized I have things I have to work out. Things I'd rather not, but I have to. \n\nMy little sister and I were very close. She called me daily. We always hung out. She always wanted to hear about the guys I dated. Even wanted to set me up a few times haha. \n\nI am 2 years older than her so we grew up together and had the same friends. Our rooms were next to each other even. \n\nAs we got older we just got closer. She'd always tell me how proud she was of me (I had a kick ass career and life was just generally great)\n\nBut on December 2nd, 2011 I got a phone call from my mom to drive home. I fought her. It was midnight and I lived 90 minutes from home. But I still got in my car and drove home. \n\nI first tried calling my sister to see what's going on. She didn't answer her phone. I didn't think anything of it. \n\nWhen I got in the door, I could tell my mom was crying. Oh shit. \n\n\"Carlie was in a car accident. She didn't make it\"\n\nI threw up. I spent the next 12 hours just not even believing it. My parents had to take my phone away from me so I'd stop calling her. It was bad. \n\nTo this day we don't know what caused the accident. But I do know horrible details about the accident that makes it worse (she laid in the snow alone before she died, and the ambulance was just pulling up as she passed. )\n\nAt the funeral everyone kept saying how beautiful she was. My parents had her wearing her favorite zebra print shirt and her hair curled. Yes, she was beautiful. \n\nI spent the next month seeing her face every time I closed my eyes and just in a general fog. I quit my job, left my apartment and moved home. \n\nMy mom started giving me her oxy and I never stopped. \n\nI haven't been clean long term since then. \n\nWhen I talk to people about my habit they often say, \"your sister wouldnt want...'\n\nAnd I lose it every time. It's so old.\n\nIt's been 3 years and I've only gotten worse. I don't even know what to do with myself anymore. I hope I'll stay clean, and I'll be in an environment conducive to it. So it won't be hard. \n\nMaybe I'll fall asleep at some point on this bus. I hope.","71":"I did a rapid sub taper, and I'm 6 days clean. I get to be on a bus for 58 hours (moving to Michigan). I'm SO glad I'm not physically dependant anymore. \n\nI won't end up homeless because my boyfriends parents got me a ticket and made me move in. I suppose that's a good thing. I kept telling him to leave without me. \n\nMaybe moving to a place with no connections, without a  dependence, will lead to me finally staying clean. I'm ready to stop worrying about getting well and money and hiding my shit. \n\nI don't wanna live in the middle of nowhere but maybe it's for the best.","72":"I've gotten so much love and support and even offers of REAL HELP. \n\nLuke and I are just in awe. The love here is unmatched. \n\nThere are people in my messages offering food, places to stay, transportation, and just and ear to listen. \n\nI've been crying all day. \n\nThank you, opiates. So much. I'd name you all, but there are tons. Just know I'll reply to EVERYTHING. \n\njust amazing.","73":"I'm sick. In a week il be homeless. No job. Money. Food. Nothing. \n\nI probably deserve it. Hopefully this klonipin, booze and maybe some gabapentin will help me sleep. \n\nNever ever thought I'd be here. Ever.","74":"STOPPIT!\n\nUs PNWers drool so hard seeing your fat lines of precious ECP, it makes our actual fire tar look like, well, shit.\n\nHappy Monday &lt;3","75":"Most of you know I have a boyfriend who I've been using behind his back for a little while.\n\nHe said if I used, he'd leave me. Fair enough.\n\nSo after some thought, I told him I couldn't stop soon enough. Figured he'd be better off anyway. \n\nWell, my plan fucking backfired. \n\nHe got tears in his eyes and said, \"I don't care. I'm not leaving. I love you. \"\n\nAnd after some talking I was going to pick up anyway. Fuck me, right?\n\nAt the end he kissed my cheek and whispered in my ear, \"please be careful\"\n\nJESUS FUCKING CHRIST WHAT JUST HAPPENED.\n\nFor this moment. And this moment only. I am firmly planted in this bedroom. \n\nHoly. Shit. Maybe I'll stop crying next week.","76":"i love having dudes who are awake before you are. just got 6 points :)\n\nI've been trying to slow down for my boyfriends sake, but the cravings this morning were SO BAD. \n\nMaybe one day...","77":"I only ask because I was watching Intervention and they said this girl was shooting Percocet. There's no way she could do that and live right? Hell, snorting percs is bad..\n\nDo they know what they were talking about, or is it possible without any problems? It made shudder...","78":"Since I moved out here 3 months ago, I've overdosed on meth, almost died from speedballs, fallen out like twice.... was hospitalized twice (once for a suicide attempt) and almost lost my job.\n\nNow, I'm clean, I have my dream job, and I have someone who loves me.\n\nBut today I was notified my application to be added as a roommate on my friends apartment was denied, so I technically can't stay here. He moved back home, and he can't afford to break the lease.\n\nSo, he's basically counting on me to be here to pay for stuff.\n\nHe said he's fine with us staying here (even though we technically can't be), so that's good. For now. I'm still freaking out because most of you know my boyfriend is moving out here in TWO WEEKS to live with me... I kinda need a place for him to stay when he gets out here. Sounds like I do for the moment.\n\nI want a break, please?","79":"My roommates moved out last night. My paycheck clears Monday. I'm all by myself for 2 weeks. Will I or won't I relapse? That is the question. I really want to because I get super lonely when I'm by myself, but I could lose a LOT if I do\n\nHope you all get what you need this weekend!","80":"Tomorrow is payday. Tomorrow both of my roommates are moving out and I'll be alone for 16 days.\n\nHow the HELL am I going to stay clean... I've been doing a mostly okay job of distracting myself lately.\n\nThere's a Kava bar by my work I really wanna try. That stuff knocks me OUT COLD.","81":"So, I've never been tested for anything, and I've put myself in some not-so-safe situations. My boyfriend is moving across the country so we can be together and he knows all about my use and stuff and he says he doesn't care if I end up testing positive for anything, and that he'll just let me give it to him because he plans on marrying me.\n\nHow nuts does that sound? I plan on getting tested before he gets here, and then we'll know for sure.\n\nThe only thing that scares me is that I've shared needles. Oh well, nothing I can do about it now.","82":"Been clean 13 days. I feel okay. None of my connects are responding, I have no idea why. Maybe its for the better because I'm craving BAD.\n\nBut in 42 days, the single reason I'd stay clean is moving in. I'm really optimistic but my addict brain is trying to psych me out.\n\nHow is everyone doing?","83":"Anyone ever get an IV, or blood drawn from someone in anesthesiology in a vein they didn't know existed?\n\nI got blood drawn today twice right in the middle of my arm, to the right of my crook. They felt a huge vein, but I can't at all.\n\nThey're wizards. and I thought I was good at my body. :P","84":"Still in the hospital. Day 7. I'm on day 12 of being clean. No more withdrawal.\n\nBut the doctors gave me some news last night night. Something is wrong with my heart, so they did an EKG, and took some blood this morning.\n\nGreat. Right as I planned on getting my shit together. \n\nBut at this point, dope is the only thing that will put me to sleep. The sleeping pill they gave me didnt even work last night so I somehow got 3 hours of sleep.\n\nI hope I dont use when I get out, but if my stress comes back... or if I lose my job... my hopes will be gone.","85":"I've been clean 11 days. Cold turkey.\r\rMy heart is beating out of my chest, but my mood is great.\r\rAfter a recent suicide attempt I've been in the hospital since Monday.\r\rI plan on staying clean, mostly for one person. The love of my life. \r\r9\/12\/2012 a new Facebook friend decided to visit me. He stayed 2 weeks. \r\rNow instead of getting high and ruining my life, im planning (with his mom) to surprise him for his birthday in 2 months.\r\rWe haven't seen each other in almost 3 years but that doesn't diminish what I've always felt.\r\rIf I can find a reason to stay clean, every reader of this sub does.\r\rIm NOT leaving :)","86":"At first I loved speedballs, but now their magic is gone ao I just feel the coke and strung out. \n\nGot some ice Today and I'm pumped for the rush. To me,meth is a  nice clean high over coke no euphoria. \n ","87":".. as I pour this shot into my nose because I forgot to go to the exchange today. Fuck. Me.\n\nBetter than nothing :\/\n\nBeing gay, you'd think I'd be a fan of another, more efficient ROA, but I actually HATE it lol. Props to those who don't flinch.","88":"I get my first paycheck in 2 months on July 10th.and on monday a payment of $800 from a friend is posting my account.\n\nMost of you know I've been struggling with withdrawal \/ getting dope.\n\nSo, today I managed to get one of my dudes to get me a sack for 2 subs.. he USUALLY does 4. He felt bad so he's like, \"Fine. JUST once.\"\n\nand I got to see my partner in crime, \"A FRIEND\" (he didn't like being called out) today.\n\nSo at the moment I'm not sick... but the next few days will be a mental challenge. luckily I have Hulu &amp; Workoholics to distract me :D\n\nLet's all hope that the cash posts on Monday and I can score and finally do a proper fucking speedball. Otherwise I just have to wait until Friday.. then my money issues will be wiped out.","89":"First started snorting a few times a week in June 2013. Now I IV as much as humanly possible. I often reflect on how I got here... the milestones are permanently part of my memory. IVing for the first time... getting that first non-middle phone number... meeting other users and actually becoming close friends... then destroying my life in the process.\n\nI remember where I was when I snorted for the first time. When I IVd, too. When I copped for the first time. All these firsts make me smile. My favorite is walking my friend through the process of IVing for the first time over the phone.. and after 10 minutes, he did it! That made me super proud, haha.\n\nThe fond memories are getting me through the sickness. \n\nAs always, love you guys.","90":"AND BITCHES ARE OUT. It never takes them this long to reup. Jesus.\n\nStill dying :P","91":"I'm broke. So I'm sick. And it hurts. Physically and mentally. It doesn't help that I'm already suicidal but oh boy. Advil and kava tea really help with the physical stuff. We have a lava bar out here that im going to tomorrow but for now... My flesh feels like it's falling off my bones and I will do ANYTHING for it to stop. \n\nAhhhhhh. ","92":"Tomorrow I get my LAST bag for almost 2 weeks. I can't stop, but I have to take a break. I started my job just on time for a decent pay check. So in about 10 days, I can get super high. :D\n\nIf you're sick over the next week and a half, I'll be with you.\n\nOh and one of my closest friends proposed today. He was serious.","93":"I've been here 2 months. I have all the connects I need. I just got a fancy job but today is actually the first day in 3 months I haven't used daily. So I'm sweating my balls off and the sub I've been saving isn't doing ANYTHING for all my sensitive nerves. Seriously, someone walks by and I shudder. Blech, nothing a little dopamine rush from music can't at least patch up for now.\n\nSo, I guess I LOVE my new area and new job. I'M EVEN DATING A GUY. IMAGINE THAT LOL.\n\nTotally random post but I haven't talked to a bunch of you in a while. Figured I'd give an update.\n\n(PS- the movie Cake on Netflix is fucking amazing. Don't watch it when you're emotional, you'll jump off a building.)","94":"What. The. Fuck. \n\nSomething just happened. I just did a speedball nothing too large; in fact I've done larger before. I feel the response almost killed me. First it was fine. Then my body got tingly. Then it hurt like an artery from head to toe. Then my heard was so bizarre. Like I was hearing noises I couldn't possibly ever describe the sounds I was hearing. I didn't know if I hit an artery, if the shit was bad, or what. \n\nI've had both before without ANY issues. \n\nWhat. The. Fuck. \n\nEDIT: yes, 5 minutes later I was alright. It just stopped. But the sound effects I was hearing was soooooo bizarre. ","95":"I've been using every single day for at LEAST the last month. I thought I was doing a good job, but my roommates wanted to go through my shit today. Luckily I was able to ditch everything before they caught me. I could tell they suspected, but I never expected them to actually confront me.\n\nI have been really careless lately.. not caring how much I do, or what happens. But now my tolerance is so high, I barely feel 4 points. I should try a G shot.\n\nI love this place, and I'm even dating (sort of) which is way more than I can say for my hometown. A friend of mine said I should tell the guy I'm seeing about my use... HA, YEAH RIGHT GIRL. PSH. NOT HAPPENING.\n\nI need a shot now, lol.\n\n&lt;3 you guys.","96":"Hiya. Haven't posted really anything since I've moved. My life has been put on pause, but my drug use has only gotten worse. \n\nComing out here, I ended up meeting an awesome guywho helped me out a ton. He ended up giving me 3 numbers. The cast of characters I've met is nothing short of entertaining. \n\nIm currently wait for a  G to be delivered to me, and even if I get there at the same time they do, they'll still apologize for being late. These guys are the nicest, and they serve as early as 6am I've heard. \n\nHow has everyone been??","97":"who's withdrawal symptoms are WAY worse when snorting. IVing, they're so minimal, it's almost non-existent.\n\nWhen I was snorting, if I stopped for any length of time, I was bed-ridden. Sweating, runny nose, entire body on fire but now I just have a tiny bit of anxiety in my chest, and no physical symptoms at all. No sweating, no watery eyes. It's the WEIRDEST thing.","98":"So, it took moving across the country to realize I was getting fucked at $120\/g before. I'm paying about $90\/g or $10\/point now which I'm hearing is only because I don't have the \"golden\" connect.\n\nWow, so much money wasted.","99":"I just up and moved 1700 miles. I have no family and very few friends out here. I have all the dope in the world, though. It's only half as good as where I'm from. It sucks.\n\nJust when I start to get really anxious about everything, I calm myself down. I hope moving was the right thing. It happened so fast...","100":"In 48 hours I'll start the 26 hour drive to the Pacific Northwest. I already have more numbers there than I do here. So much for getting clean, if anything it'll get worse but.. who cares?\n\nIn a few hours I'll be picking up for the last time in Minneapolis. I'm really excited to leave. Most people would be nervous but I couldn't be more excited. \n\nMy best friend said if I move out there and I continue using, she'll open the gates of hell on me lol. I feel bad, but I've gotten really good at hiding it.\n\nI'm watching Intervention at work (that needle fix, yo), what's everyone else doing??","101":"so i pick up fairly often and when my guy cant get more and i get sick, he usually throws me a point or 2 from his own stash.  today hes bringing me some at work  im going to miss this kind of service when I move :(","102":"I've only used once in like the last 2 weeks. Subs made my landing smooth. I feel OKAY... but bored. Just got the results of an interview I had the other day, and submitted my code test and basically they really want me. So I'm expecting a formal offer in the next day. That would mean moving to PDX, WOO :D\n\nBut it gives me pause. I may have found an \"easy\" way out if I treat it that way, but I'm leaving behind really good friends who are just going to get worse and it kills me. One of these friends asked me to help him shoot up, so I taught him. Never doing that again, my god. he's worse than me now :( it makes me sad.\n\nI'm actually kinda close with these 2 college kids who pick up every so often. They only smoke tar (at the moment). I'm really glad I met them, they're good kids, but.. if I just gave them the key to the city...I don't know what I'll do if they end up like me. I'd never forgive myself.\n\n(I know they're reading this, so guys you know I care about you, so take my warnings seriously... I never did)\n\nI really hope I don't use again.","103":"I met Matt in 2011 through some mutual friends. We haven't spoken much in the last year, and just tonight when I go to message him I found out he died of a heroin overdose in January.\n\nGOD DAMMIT. He was one of the good ones.\n\nTEST SHOTS PEOPLE.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.burnhamours.com\/obits\/obituary.php?id=527794","104":"I don't entirely know and that's probably a good thing. All I know are bit and pieces of memory flashes here and there (thanks, Etizolam)\n\nBut I just know my mom, dad, and brother ALL confronted me and asked what the hell I was doing.\n\nMy dad owns a restaurant so we all met up there for brunch. I remember going there but I don't remember anything else. But I heard it was bad. I'll ask my brother for details today and update the post.\n\nIt started on Saturday when a friend and her boyfriend took me to a movie. After the movie I think I suggested we get meth, and we did. Over the next couple hours I was all over my friend's boyfriend... which they were both fine with. He totally didn't care -- only after proclaiming he was straight a million times, haha. Which then lead to .. (I'll let your imagination go from here)\n\nI was dropped off at 8am Easter morning and that's the last thing I remember.\n\nThat was, hands down, the craziest weekend I've ever had. I did things I never thought I'd do. I regret nothing, except embarrassing my parents with whatever it is I did.\n\nAfter everything that happened this weekend, I realized I'm jealous of the connection my friends have. If you have someone in your life you share everything with, don't take it for granted. There are those of us who sit around alone everyday.\n\n(If you guys are reading this, thanks for everything)","105":"Today is payday, and I have tomorrow off work.\n\nSo, I'm picking up for the first time since Sunday! YES. Nodding all day tomorrow sounds awesome. Anyone else have absolutely no plans tomorrow??\n\nOh, and I saw someone else post a pic with his eyes all effed up. Mine get REALLY bad, so maybe I'll post one, too. It's pretty hilarious.","106":"I haven't hard a car since September when I took too many benzos and crashed it. Oops.\n\nBut that hasnt stopped me from getting dope. I take the train downtown, then take a bus to my guys house. \n\nThe only shitty part is that he's tar only :( I need a vehicle to get the kickass powder here. Oh well, tar is better than nothing, and cheaper too.\n\nI know some of you drive across state lines, and even drive for hours to cop. What's the longest trip you've made just to get dope??\n\nStay safe &lt;3","107":"The title is kind of a metaphor for the last few days.\n\nFirst of all, the coolest people on the internet are in this sub and made yesterday really awesome for me. I'm clean-ish and I actually feel fine (I really hope to stay that way.). \n\nAfter my best friend moved, I got really lonely  and I'm still struggling with it but I'm becoming more okay with not being the social butterfly I was before ever using. Actually meeting people here has really helped with that actually.\n\nHere's to no dope, more friends, and who knows what else.\n\nI'll be on TinyChat on and off most of the night, so don't leave me alone, haha","108":"So, why am I posting today? Because I'm chatty, and I won't wanna hear the word \"birthday' tomorrow.\n\ngot some free subs so I feel good today. but it FUCKING SNOWED last night. So, fuck that.\n\nBasically, you're my only people. All my IRL \"friends\" are all married with kids.. and here I am, 25 and never dated (gay guy here). Kinda puts a damper on having any fun. So I'll be around here tomorrow. \n\nFeel free to say hi if we've never talked! :D\n\n(PS, super chatty today, so say hi today too, haha)\n\nLove you all, stick around plzzzzz.\n\nEDIT: My mom said something that stopped me stone cold. Because she's so right. She said, and I quote, \"No wonder you have no friends. Nobody wants to get close to someone who's going to die!\"\n\nThat's rough.\n\n**Edit 3: I have no words. I never expected much of a response to this bratty post, but I'm beyond overwhelmed by how great you all are. Today will be better than I hoped and its because of you.**","109":"Sunday's are the days I usually run out so I kinda just lounge around.\n\nBut it looks like my crystal guy might have a friend who can get some dope! He gave it up a while ago due to all the shit, but said he'll help me out.\n\nI'm so excited, guys.","110":"He replied, \"Bro we had this talk once before they not trying to meet anyone else I tried to hook up one of the brothers with him no good later don't ask me that no more\"\r\rWTF is my deal? Ugh, fuck!\r\rTime to go with someone else. ","111":"This is the longest I've gone without dope since I started shooting. Yesterday I basically wanted to die. \r\rI decided to pop a couple caffeine pills about an hour ago and I feel like I can run a few miles. I feel great. Plus im probably copping today. \r\rHope today is better than yesterday! \r\rOh and if you haven't had the pleasure of chatting at length with Tracey, do so! She distracted me almost all day yesterday from the crazy anxiety. \r\rLove you all bunches!","112":"I hate them so much. It can take me a good 10 minutes to register with a brand new rig.\r\rBut the longer ones are easier to handle with my massive, clumsy hands. \r\rAnybody have any tips to make hitting with short ones easier? My arm looks like a nasty pincushion. ","113":"My closest friend is moving accross the country today. She told me last week. Like what the hell. \r\rShe was the only friend who still give a shit about me. \r\rNow all I have is my using friends, endless dope, and the broke\/dope cycle. \r\rHoping to score a small bag today to forget for ay least a little while. \r\rWithdrawing and being sick SUCKS. ","114":"Up until today he's been hesitant but he bought some rigs today, and asked me to help him.\n\nI simply walked him through some tips, and after 15 minutes, he registered. :)\n\nIf you're having issues registering, just call me haha.","115":"I have a few connects that I trust with my money. I found out a friend of mine has a local H guy. I should have a bag within the hour... If not, well shit. ","116":"so, my use is relatively hidden. My connects \/ using friends aren't connected in anyway to my \"real\" life.. yet Facebook happens to suggest my tar guy, and a using friend as \"people I may know\"\nYOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT FACEBOOK. Of course I added them lol","117":"So I got some meth instead. It always helps withdrawal because I get more depressed than anything physical. ","118":"The best damn text message ever!!\r\rSometimes my tar boy is around early (like today) and somwtimes it takes him all day.\r\rBut as soon as he sends \"Im here\", I jump out of my desk, take the elevator down 8 floors and navigate the skyway for 4 blocks.

So I'm 32 days in but certain circumstances will put me in touch with some tar today and im so excited. \n\nIM not worried about getting sucked in again because this is just a 1 time event due to my new job. (I'm doing a test run to find my office so I don't get lost on my first day)\n\nIt's gonna feel SO good to push off &lt;3","120":"I haven't gone this long with  single opiate in like 2 years. Meth made the physical WD super easy. But now I CANT SLEEP FOR SHIIIIT. I stay up at late and wake up by 6am. EVeryday. That would be great if I didn't get let go in October.\n\nI'm just glad I have some sort of a support system while I try to find a job because unemployment is NOT close to enough to pay my bills.\n\nBut at least I'm clean.","121":"So I've been crashing on my friends couch for the past month after I lost my job. I've been waiting for unemployment to kick in for 3 weeks and it finally came! And my friend gave me some dope that doesn't suck! \n\nNow that I have cash, I can now prepare for Thanksgiving next week so I won't be sick, and I can go out and do shit, like buy food =P\n\nHope your weekend goes well :)","122":"So guys, I went to treatment!\n\nFirst thing I did when I got back? Fixed up 3 fat shots. And now I'm drinking myself to sleep. \n\nMaybe I'll get help one day. Maybe I won't wake up at all one day. \n\nEither is ok with me. \n\nI'm thinking of getting on subs long-term also. \n\nHow's everyone??","123":"I used to rely on lope and etiz. \n\nDiclazepam gets rid of every symptom except the faucet in the bathroom ;)\n\nBut that's what lope is for. \n\nDiclazepam is great. Take 3-5mg. (If you can find \/ import it)","124":"In the last week I've started using the needle 95% of the time. I love every part of it. The initial breaking of the skin, the blood plume knowing you're in, and the obsessive excitement when you're pushing down the plunger knowing whats coming.\n\nSO... my issue has been registering. Out of 10 attempts, I MAYBE register once. Maybe. So either I just get pissed and snort it, but probably plug it, but tonight, I wouldn't give up and I hit the biggest shot I've mixed so far! The cotton was 2-3 days old so I'm a little worried.\n\nThe point of the post is that if you're like me and have issues registering- DONT GIVE UP! They're always a vein, and there's always a way.\n\nI'm super high and happy, how are you? :)","125":"So the first time someone hit me, he found a vein. I have HUGE juice veins in my crooks. \n\nNow that I boUght rigs I can't find a vein for shit. \n\nAll this poking is gonna call for lots of long sleeves. \n\nI did hit on my first try, though. That was cool. But I wanted another shot but NOPE. IT WOULDNT REGISTER. Ugh. Maybe tomorrow. \n\nI hate not knowing everything about shooting.

I didn't take anything this morning because id get well before work. NOPE. \n\nMy new job is awesome in so many ways but if I have to start my search for a dboy over again im going to flip my shit.

WOO*","130":"I'm going to wake up in a world of hurt tomorrow morning. I know meth typically helps WD symptoms, but would these 20mg Adderall XR be worth taking upon awaking?

Thank god I had the foresight to dose before going to bed because even on the 30mg I took last night.. I still woke up with the shakes, and promptly took another 20mg.\n\nI'm now sitting at work, mostly well.

I don\u2019t even recognize the mod list...)\n\nBut I was thinking right when I got on methadone last year, I got this dope that was really strange. I don\u2019t remember feeling high, I just remember a \u201ctrippy\u201d feeling. It was SUPER dysphoric for daaaayyyss and I just found out some kappa opioid agonists can do that. \n\nHas anyone had that had before? Are there any particular cuts that would induce such a dysphoric feeling? I meant to ask back then but I was busy.","138":"So I posted a few days ago about how much my life has gotten better. And I got a lot of support. \n\nBut I\u2019ve been thinking about a lot of things recently. \n\nI have an ex whose life I practically imploded in every possible way. \n\nHe blocked me on FB last year suddenly. But we remained friendly from the time we broke up until then. (Like a 2y span) \n\nThen suddenly yesterday my mom asks why she couldn\u2019t see his FB profile anymore. And I had to explain that I knew exactly why he did it. \n\nI assume he woke up one day and realized that I\u2019m a shitty person and he deserved way better. But now my moms upset because she loved him and she misses talking to him. \n\nSo now I\u2019ve spent this weekend actually trying to process what I did to him. \n\nIt was BAD. And I know that. I was bad. I was very harmful, incredibly manipulative and VERY uncaring. \n\nAnd somehow he found this out (I have no idea. We do still have mutual friends tho) and sent a friend to explain what I already knew. \n\nI guess he\u2019s engaged to an amazing guy, and they\u2019re buying a house soon. And he basically just needed to cut me out so he can heal and build a life for himself. \n\nI am incredibly happy for him. Genuinely. I\u2019m just very guilty for what I put him through. \n\nFor those that have extended clean time, how do you deal with the guilt of hurting people in your past?","139":"You guys I can\u2019t believe it. \n\nI\u2019ve been clean for like 13 months. \n\nYesterday I got  job offer at a treatment center and I started crying.

Completed the week, and got sent home with no prospects of any inpatient programs to affect me for a minimum of 3 weeks. ...so of course after that suboxone was finished and out if my system, as much as I really wanted sobriety this time around, I picked some heroin up. I didn't IV it though I snorted it lol so of course that makes it all OK now smh......well anyway I'm still an addict, and can't get into a rehab till third week of March. Smh so I have to wait before anywhere has a bed open to get in. \n\nSo next week or so I'll have to go back to the detox place for the week so I can get in to the rehab and go right from the detox so I wouldn't be stuck going back to the streets and having any temptations ruin my start of sobriety.\n\nI got home from detox yesterday and within 5 hours was on the street living again. Went to the local salvation army shelter right now..got dome dinner atleast and s bed for he night..praying I can keep this together till this rehab has an open bed for me.\n\nSo anyway just a little check up on my life if anyone's wondering haha I'm sure no-one is but hey whatever lol love you guys hope y'all Doing well yourselves.\n\n Love, Jangles","143":"Called 1000 junkies.

I mean I'm not complaining but I can't get a benadryl or ambient or even a simple Valium but they keep handing me opiates like candy. I'm now on 10mg norco, 30mg oxy, 4mg morphine iv.

I got no health insurance tho, and if I goto the hospital and strain myself going into really bad withdrawal sounds like it could worsen the problem.

Thankfully he met me next door to another dboy of mines house and he had hmu saying he had some shit that'll\nMake me do the James brown lol. Had no money of course but called him anyway asking for a sample to try the new stuff out since he knows I middle for a lot of people and will bring him a lot of money he agrees and shows up 3 mins later with a nice bit of gun powder for me. Now I hate tar, gun powder, etc...I only like ecp but when broke and being given a free bag I'll take whatever.

I was amazed and I literally just did my last wash cause I finally came out f my nod and wanted to go back and surprisingly got another nice shot out of the wash and even caught a short rush.

Saying its 1 mile off this exit...then when we get there he says oh it's like 3 miles down. So we get closer and then he goes oh wait it's actually 14 miles. I'm like really bro we aren't gonna make it, but he insists he has a gas can full of gas. So we get there, and this kid comes to the car and hops in. The gas can had maybe 2$ worth of gas in it...if that. Then he pulls out two Starbucks gift cards as payment for the dope. Wait so u got no money bro? Naw I'm sorry just 35$ on these gift cards. Wow dude ok your a piece of shit for lying about everything so I take his bag and empty 3\/4 out of it and say take it or leave it now we have to find a food lion to sell this gift card to the coin star machine. We finally find a food lion but no damn machine. Fcked. So we pull out and bam we run out of gas. Now we're broke and out of gas about 35 mins from either of our homes. Time for a 2 mile walk to find. Gas station and a kind hearted soul. Thankfully we get to one and this guy throws is 5$ for gas. Awesome then this kid asks us to buy him beer and we tell him yea but u gotta drive us to our car. Nice. Now time to find a food lion we can sell the cards at and get more gas and cigarettes before headin home. Every machine we find doesnt work. Fucked. So now we're about 2 miles from my house and my boys still 20 miles from his. Cars puttering outta gas, but we make it to my house. We brainstorm how to get him home and come up with nothing. He says fuck it he gonna go to a close gas station and try to ask someone to help him out. I really hope he made it home okay. Of course we were lookin around my garage for a full gas can I thought we had before he left and my folks come out thinking were stealing shit from the garage. Fucked. Lol tonight has been a fuckin trip from hell. Did I do something wrong to deserve all this bad karma coming my way? Fucked isn't even the word anymore this whole night has been a cluster fuck of bullshit. All because this stupid fucking kid couldn't just tell the truth, and got us all fucked up. He's lucky he didn't get knocked out for making us come 30 mins away to help him out since he was sick and he actually pulled that bhllshit. If he woulda said where he actually was we could taken a better route and saved gas, and if we knew we were getting gift cards instead of money we would of saved a few bucks for gas instead of gettin just dope. I really despise some people.its people like him that give us a bad name. Smh. End rant.\n\nTldr: junkies lie. Made us run out of gas. Buzz kill. No bogies. No Bueno. Fuck Starbucks. And fuck that kid.","175":"You don't realiZe u passed out with ur dope next to u on paper and knocked it into your pina coloda drink mix. Go to get high and realize your fucked. Fml so hard. Atleast I'm working tonight n tomorrow. Hope yalls mornin has been better than mine!","176":"I got this dope from one of my normal dboys today..it was light tan. Not thinking anything of it, I do my normal decent size shot....only 1 shot all day, it was about 2 points only. Nothing crazy or huge at all. I got the most intense rush I've ever had, then pins n needles set in, and then I fell out. Woke up 30\/40 mins later contorted in my buddies front seat with my head on the center console. He's like damn bro u been noddin hard. I'm like half awake like what's goin on? He drops me off And i hop out, go inside the crib, goto take a shit and bam fall out again for 2 hours sitting on the toilet. Thought I was dead. So I wake up hours later sitting there like wtf is up wit this shit. Go and sit down and bam I'm out again. Literally been 8 hours now and every time I sit down and relax for 2\/3 mins I'm noddin out hard as fuck. \n\nI've been doin dope for a very long time and this has never happened like this from one single shot way earlier today. If it's fentanyl it's or crazy legs cause the high I can compare to fent. Idk though I'm still nodding  off, I don't even wanna get more dope I'm still high which is super weird for me, normally even fire dope has me redosing a couple hours later.\n\nSo is there a fent analog out there with legs? Or was this possibly just some of the best most pure dope I've ever had? And I'm from NY we used to get some serious fire and this shit was a whole other level. Bright yellow clear like piss in my rig. Reeked of vinegar and tasted like dope. Hmmm","177":"This morning I wake up sick and whatnot, before I can even get up and moving around my newest dboy I met that lives around the corner from me calls me and asks if I needed anything and I say naw I'm broke and sick bro, i wish. So he says oh ite an hangs up. 3 mins later I get a text saying \"kome outside bruh\". Walk outside and he's out there and hands me a bag and says go eat some breakfast and get outta bed. Dude just gave me a free .25. Stoked! Haven't even been fuckin wit dude for long, only met him a couple weeks ago and lucked out since he lives about a 30 second walk away. Never expected him to be this cool though haha. Sorry for shitposting. Dude just put me in a good ass mood lol.\n\nAnyway it's shitty out and raining here. Sunday's suck. How's everyone else's day going so far?? Everyone be safe out there!!!","178":"Another friend died today. That's fucking 4 now this week. Wtf. Why? And this other kid left a note and went missing so if he's found dead that's 5 friends in a fuckin week. Idk what to do. This fentanyl bullshit has to stop","179":"And another good friend gone today. RIP Anthony, this shits gotta stop already too many people the past couple weeks","180":"So me an my two boys go to pickup some fire. The one kid said he hasn't been using a lot lately and been tryna get clean cause of court. Anyway we get some top notch fire and we all do a shot, we're all noddin but I notice dude I front of me in front passenger seat isn't responding to anything so I'm like oh fuck bro did he overdose? We shake him and try to wake him but no luck. Thankfully we were only down the road like 3 mins from where I'm staying and my boy I stay with had narcan. So I rush back to the crib get all the narcan and we hit him with 2mg....nothing. Fuck ok so we do another 2mg and still nothing. We call an ambulance since hospital was too far with traffic, and thankfully dude wakes up. Sheesh shit was dumb scary thought another friend was gonna die. This stuff wasn't even fentanyl either dude just had no tolerance since getting arrested and tryna stay clean. Crazy shit man narcan is a life saver.. Thank god my boy had some or else we would be burying another friend. Smh\ud83d\ude30","181":"Hope everyone had an awesome day! I had very low hopes I'd have a good thanksgiving not being with family this year and no one inviting me over but the homie u\/lolzlikeforreal and his wife made today one of the better turkey days I've had. These two have opened their home up to me and treated me like a member of their family. I owe them so much and then some, they have been the backbone to me coming out of my depression and funk, and have restored my faith in humanity. These two are some awesome human beings, and anyone who has them in their lives are blessed beyond words. We ate so much awesome food and fried my first turkey ever an it was delicious! Was able to middle up some dope so I wasnt sick all day either, they had friend coming in and out all day so we pretty much just smoked a bunch of pot and ate a shitload of delicious food him and his wife cooked. It was an awesome day to say the least. Just felt humbled by today and my latest experiences and felt the need to share before I went to sleep. I love this community, almost all of you are awesome people!! Don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise! Hope y'all had a decent day though, and if ya didn't there's always next year! Don't take the small things for granted and be in a shitty mood if your sick, just remember you could be sick and not have anyone to be around or with for the holidays. If you got people around you that care about you then your already winning. With that said good night Reddit, I love y'all!","182":"So my buddy and his wife had this awesome idea to go around selling hot dogs, coffee, and lil bags of chips to all the people standing in line. Figure we can net a nice chunk of change off that. Figured I'd also share it with y'all in case some of y'all are broke and want a semi legal depending on where u live way to make some extra money to cop or pay rent or whatever. But dogs and chips are the only thing you'll need to really buy and it's cheap considering you can sell a dog chips and a coffee for like 4\/5$ to cold desperate people that you know have money on them most likely lol and make 30\/40 sales throughout the night and your Gucci. ","183":"When your family wants nothing to do with you, and your stuck with no job, no money, and a car that's 500 miles away. I'm so beyond stressed out and depressed nothing seems to be working out for me. I've lost everything good I had. I miss my dogs, I miss being able to eat normal meals and not dollar lunchables and ramen. I'm lucky to have some friends that let me stay with them but I'm so useless I figured I'd have a job and a rented room somewhere by now. Instead everyday I just fall deeper and deeper into this depressed state. Idk what to do anymore. Heroin isn't even the problem, it's that I'm in a kind of new state and got exiled after investing all my money into a house I can't live in and now I'm left fend for myself completely screwed. I lost my best friend, and my aunt, last week. Nothing in my life is good. I kind of just wanna overdose at this point. And no I don't want attention but I got nowhere else I say anything. I'm tired of this life and see no possible outcome where I pull through and am living a normal happy life. From here I see shelters, jail, rehab, halfway houses, etc.. And then inevitably the street until I'm that guy you might give a dollar to. Fuck.","184":"So I went up to food lion to grab some food and a drink, and waiting for my homie to scoop me to go grab something. I walk out and light a cigarette and skate towards the ga station next door. This black dude covered in gold jewelry calls me over asking if I need some bud. I say nah Tryna grab dog food. He looks around and says I got that. I'm like yea whatever and he says stay right here. So I give him the benefit of doubt, and wait for like 5\/6 mins and he comes back as has me walk into this cell phone store his girlfriend or whatever is working at. He throws a bag of rocks on the table and says here ya go, take my number. Boom he lives one block over from where I'm staying at. I do the stuff and it knocks me on my ass. Completely floored it was that easy to get some dope lol I was about to have to go like 20 miles to see my normal dude but nope not anymore haha can't believe that shit happened. Can't beat it though, don't have to go very far for my dope now lol wish this happened to me when I first move here and was out lookin for plugs. Successful afternoon. Now off to a job interview! ","185":"So things have been alright. An awesome human and his wife have opened their home to me to help me get back on my feet. I cannot express my gratitude and thanks to them for all they have done for me, it's completely restored my faith in humanity. They have made this transition back on my own so much better and easier on myself but I need to get my own spot asap I hate feeling like a moocher ya kno? The position my family left me in was pretty fucky\u00ff....anyway...\n\nSo I lost a few people over the past two or so weeks. One is still fighting for his life in ICU in a coma right now. His left lung just collapsed again last night, and he had a stroke a couple nights prior. No Bueno....\n\nSo today I was walking to a job at a catering hall, was suppose to work as a server tonight. I was stoked to make some extra money and all that jazz, but course life snuck up behind me with a raging hard on, and got me again. My mom calls me for the first time since I've been out of the house. I'm thinking maybe they're gonna apologize to me....but nope of course not, so this call can only be bad news. I thought  a thousands different reasons shed call me....well apparently early this morning on her way to work my aunt was in a bad wreck and passed away. Fucked. She was like a second mother, her and her family all just moved down here with us, they lived around the corner from the house i was just kicked out of....her, my uncle, and my cousins were the closest family we have they are like brothers and sisters and my aunt and uncle are like parents, we did everything together. Hell they moved down south with us only 20 seconds away just so we'd all be together. This shit sucks, it hits like a Fukin Mack truck...why does this kind of stuff happen to the good people who deserve nothing but happiness. Such a good person, always giving and never taking. When j heard the news, I just dropped down and sat against this stores back wall and haven't moved in awhile. I'm completely like idk just broken. I just can't take all this bullshit nothing in my life has been working out no matter how hard I try and pray for help and guidance, I just get shitted on. Fml idk what to do anymore. Everyone close to me is dying, and my family doesn't even want me around. The only thing that consistently doesn't let me down is heroin. It's sad as fuck. Idk what to do anymore","186":"So I head to do some middling and pick my stuff up from my dude. Hadda drive 20 mins away but He shows up quickly and I hop back in the car and the deal is over with in like 3 minutes of showing up, so we start heading back to the crib. My dboy always puts the shit in a dollar bill even if it's bagged up he wraps it in a dollar. So I open the dollar as we're heading back and offer a huge whiff of cannabis, and look at the bill and it's a shitload of weed wrapped up in the dollar and no dope. NOOO! Fml HAha thankfully my dboy is just a stoner and made a mistake he wasn't trying to jerk me. I call him and he says oh shit that's why I can't find my bud lol. He meets back up in like 30 seconds an gives me the good stuff, and then throws another half gram in my hand and says my bad bro just take that.  Boom! Stoked! Now I'm back chillin on the nod, waiting to see how fucked the country is gonna be; Either really fucked, or Really really fucked. Lol \n\nHope everyone's election night has been a dope one! ","187":"A Serbian film? Lolzlikeforreal showed me it and it has forever scarred me. Has anyone else ever viewed this horrific film? Baby rape is a no no!","188":"As if things couldn't get worse, I get that terrible phone call from back home. My best friend has died. Was found by his brother in his bed this morning. Smh...we were the best of friends..inseparable...fuck this hit me like a freight train idk what to do or say. \nNow I have to get my ass up to NY for the wake and funeral somehow. Idk how I'm gonna make it but I really have to try...fml and on top of it another good friend is in ICU in a coma and may be a vegetable. Shit is not cool at all....both cases had to be the fentanyl analogues going around back in my home state. \n\nThis sucks. My best friend. I didn't expect that phone call to happen. So messed up. \n\nRIP Greg, my brother I love you homie ","189":"And u get that text that someone needs and then bam two more people hit you up and next thing you know your rolling around in free heron. King Ezekiel on walking dead tonight who else tuning in? Hope everyone's feeling well tonight","190":"So I take a lyft with no hopes of getting home 25 mins away to grab again and now I'm stuck in the middle of downtown lol fml no way home and the giant burrito I had for lunch is running right through me. Fml","191":"Every time I save enough shit to do a fat shot in the morning, I end up either staying up all night waiting till the sun comes up to justify doing my last shot, or sleeping and waking up at 4\/5am and doing my last shot cause fuck it I'll figure something out in a few hours for more haha. I can never just sleep all night and wake up at a normal time and do my shot around 8\/9am so I'm well till I can get a ride into town to grab more. Gotta wait till 3\/4pm for a ride into downtown, so this last .25 shot must keep me well for the next 10\/11 hours. Fml at least this dope is straight fire and will have me sleeping atleast half that time. Worst part is if I do this shot rn I haven't slept so I'll pass right out and not enjoy my high AT ALL but I'll still do it cause fuck it.\n\nAnyone else have this problem with saving their stash ? lol like it should be so simple and yet I make it  into such a hard task and never make it last 5\/6am with the last of my shit. ","192":"So I woke up and realized like always I did all my dope at 5am. Fml. Seen the marketplace and threw up these old wrestling cards and some dumb porcelain dragons and made 200$ clutch as fuck","193":"Don't you hate it when you wait 30mins in a parking lot for your dealer to show up just to tell you oh I only have half of what you needed on me my bad . The. You have to scramble and call your backup guy just to find out he had way better dope to begin with and met up with you in less than 5 mins lol fml! Hope everyone's Sunday is going good!!","194":"I've met so many people through this sub and everyone of you are pretty damn cool. Give yourselves a round of applause! ","195":"So I woke up dying. Idk why so sick considering I had 2 nice bags the night before at like 9pm. Didn't sleep all night, and restless legs kicked in around 3-4am. Fucked. Idk why so fast. So around 11am I say fuck it, I had money but no way to my dude who was busy helping his roommate do trim work at their house. So I take a lyft about 25 mins to him. Only cost 15$ pretty decent, beat a taxi or waiting for the bus and the 2 hours the bus would have taken. Get into my dudes truck, he hands me 3 bags. I start making my shot, start to draw up, and boom my fucking rig gets stuck and the plunger pops out leaving rubber in and it popped out so fast that I dropped my spoon all over my shorts. Fucked. So fucked. Just lost 2 bags. Down the drain. Dunzo. So I say fml and do my last bag so I can get relief, and head up to the Burger King where I got my cousin to scoop me up and save me the money for a ride home. I get home, and have like 3 cottons that were pretty soaked with shit. So I do em, and instantly I'm nodding out like I just shot all three of those bags at once. I get woken up to a call from another job I applied for. So that's cool a second job would be good for me to keep me busy and pockets fat. So now I'm sitting here, staring at this huge white stain on my basket ball shorts, and these restless legs are kicking back in. Literally 2 bags of dope soaked into my basketball shorts and I have no idea how I would even get it out, haha I tried to put some water on it and rub it then suck up with my syringe but he material sucks and just wouldn't let me suck anything up. This blows lol. Why are my withdrawals starting only a few hours after each shot all the sudden? I mean the past month I was on a crazy bender doing as much dope as I wanted all day and night and then went from that to nothing really since my dude has been in and out of hospital and we haven't had any jobs. Fuck man this life is too crazy too many ups and downs in such a short time I'm getting gray hairs from this stress and I'm only 27.\n\nTl;dr.  Woke up sick, took a lyft to cop. Spilled almost all my dope due to a faulty rig and me being clumsy and sick. Got relief for an hour or two and I'm back to shit. No Bueno. I need my license back","196":"So today for the first day in a couple of months I was left with no dope. Terrible, right? First word junkie problems at its finest !\n\nSo anyway, everyone I called either couldn't get anything or had no ride and I had no ride. My main dude wss in the hospital for an ulcer. I'm freaking out here!!!! What is a junkie to do? Having money and no way to fill my desire is a literal hell on earth....in my mind atleast.\n\nMy main guy finally calls and says he's out of the E.R..... Thank you lord! But oh he doesn't feel up to driving to me snd he doesn't know what to do....fml I tel him my sympathetic heel bad for me homie lines, but to no avail....sheesh! He says try and make it through till tomorrow, when he picks me up for work and he'll take care of me. I know he will too but I want relief NOW damnit!! Haha so I call him back about 2 mins later being annoying. And luckily  one of his customers that I did a favor for last week was meeting him. Homie said I'll deliver it to broseph! Thank you lord!!! He says I'll hit you up when in close! He's only 15-20 mins tops from me so I'm like cool...set my shot up and stare at my wall waiting....and waiting...and waiting...Dafuck?!\n\nSo I call him...he says oh I'm still with buddy waiting for him to give it to me....what?!? It's been 45 mins and you didn't even leave yet....omggg haha I'm screaming in my head visualizing jumping off the Empire State Building into a pool of syringes. Why, oh why is the good lord torturing me today? I continue to be an annoying obnoxious sick pal and call homie up 3, 4, 5, 8 time! Ha ok not 8 but I did call him 2 or 3 times asking if he had left. Finally the 3rd call he says I'm 10 mins away! Oh snap! Ya boy bouta get his medicineee.!!.....\n\nSo homie pulls up 12 mins later, I grab it, thank him, and sprint into my house, up my stairs, into my roo--- wtf? I'm locked out of my room! Why Jesus, why me? So after another 20 mins of picking my lock I bust through the door as if I was saving a bunch of kids from a burning building. I'm here! I'm ready! Let's go\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc89\ud83d\udc89\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\n\nSo that's my story of today's peril, and had a decently happy ending! Just felt like sharing cause now I'm bored and got no one to talk to or nothing to do. Gosh I wish I had a xanax rn lol \n\nHow's everyone else's day going? Hopefully not as crazy as mine was.  Anyway, have fun y'all and be safe! ","197":"So my dboy drops me off for the night, and I don't take anything home with me cause I thought I had saved a .3 for tonight in my lil stash spot at home. Dboy pulls away and I'm walking inside, get into my room and sit on my bed and then it dawns on me! I fucking shot that .3 in a daze at 330am last night cause I'm a complete moron. Fml. So I had about 5, 5mg hydros and 4, 5mg roxies. Ate the hydros and the sniffed the roxies 20 mins later the. Made a decent cotton shot with about 4\/5 cottons. What are my chances that those pills will do ANYTHING for me? It's been about 40 mins since I ate the hydros and still don't feel much of anything but I just did the cotton shot 15 mins ago...reckon I'll catch a nod? Or should I just take some diphenhydramine and try to pass out? Is it worth staying up for any kind of buzz? I have a decent tolerance for Opiates...I do about .2-.4 in a shot give or take (2-4 bags), and use about a gram give or take a day....cmon pills work your magic!!!! \n\nIs it worth staying up? Will I miraculously catch a buzz and nod in a lil bit?\n\nDamn! I wish I had a Xanax or some weed right about now!","198":"Ugh. So I just wrote this post out, and went to post it, and the damn thing says this sub doesn't allow text posts? Dafuck? Well try it again. Herewegooo...\n\nOk. So this has happened to me in the past and never thought much of it. But now since joining up to this sub, of what feels like thousands upon thousands if doppelg\u00e4ngers of my addict self, I think someone should have an answer for me.\n\nSo after I do my shot, while the rush is ringing my bells, some dope will give me this weird \"taste\" of sorts, in the back of my throat. I guess you'd say it's a taste, though its very faint and in the back of my throat only. It's strange. It's rare that it happens, I know that it's from whatever the dope is cut with. It's always different tasting depending on the dope, and the size of my shot. It just happened again after my last shot. \n\nThis dope I'm doing right now has some gross cut in it, it's super bitter tasting, but a completely different taste in my throat during my rush, and I actually have to cook it a bit in a spoon just to draw it up without any of the gross shit in it. Which is very rare for me, I NEVER have to cook my ecp usually. It's really good dope though don't get me wrong, just whatever idiot had it at whatever point decided to use some unorthodox cut and mucked it up big time, it's leaves some gross plaster looking hard mush in my spoon once I'm done drawing up, and my cotton is hard as a rock after 5 minutes. Pretty fucked up that I'm even still shooting it into my veins after seeing that lol. But a junkies gonna junk.\n\nSo has anyone else had this weird taste or whatever you wanna call it? Any input would be appreciated! Thanks!","199":"Man, I just wrote this long post about this and then exited out of the app and it disappeared. So I'm gonna rewrite it but maybe shorter. We'll see. \n\nSo I was doing a job replacing 2 AC units at my house. So me and my boss finished the job, and we were waiting for his buddy to drop off frion cause we ran out. So my stupid moronic ass decided to do a shot while we waited. But instead of being smart and doing it in the comfort and privacy of my own room or bathroom, I decided to do it in the work truck in my driveway.\n\nSo I'm out there and I'm mixing my shot up and my boss says don't worry buddy I got my eyes peeled for ya. Cool. So I should be good I'm almost finished anyway. Next thing I know my moms walking outside and my boss says put it away buddy your mom! Your mom! So I get it down quick enough and hide it all, but turns out my dad decided to look out the upstairs window and somehow was at a perfect angle to see just the passenger side of the truck. I was bent over sitting down where I thought no one could so, but I guess I was wrong.\n\nSo my mom says come inside right now! I say what why?!? And she says you know why come in right now!! And I open the door and step out while saying idk what your trying to say here, and boom my cap of the rig was on my lap and it fell off my lap right by my moms foot as I got out. Fucked. Great. Dunzo. Worst part was they saw me doing this while I was sitting next to my boss. So now they're skeptical as fuck. \n\nSo now I'm standing in my kitchen wit my folks, and my boss and their just talking about another job we need done, and writing out the cheque. As soon as he leaves, I'm sure I'm in for some bitching about it all. I was so good, months now they've thought I was sober. All ruined cause of one stupid ass move on my part. Fml. \n\nI mean shit, I'm 27. I work everyday. I don't ask my parents for shit. Hell they owe me $24,000 that I lent them over a year ago when they were hurting. I mean I don't really bother anyone with my use anymore. I stay to myself, I goto work, come home and sleep then repeat. It's ridiculous that I have to deal with anyone telling me how to live. I understand  don't wanna see me overdose or die, but this is my choice I know the risks and have known the risks for the last 8 years of heroin use and 10+ of other opiates. All I ask is to be left alone and let me do my thing. Is that too much to ask? It's sad that when I go out I have to worry about my mom scavenging through my room looking for shit and clues to my use. I have no privacy. It's fucked.  Idk I had to vent. ","200":"So me and my guy are working and we thought his plug would be ready around 10am...the we call and he says about an hour, we give him 2 hours and call at 12...no bueno. He says at 3pm his delivery will be in for sure. Fuck. 3 more hours? I'm screaming in my head. Thinking so hard how I'm going to get through the next 3 hours even though it's not really a long time, but when your sick and expected to have stuff 2 hours prior it makes you a tad crazy. \n\nSo me and my dboy\/boss are sitting in his driveway bullshittin, and he says so how we gonna get you feeling well till 3? I say idk man I'm screwed got no money on me, and the other people I can call aren't around now...fuck. So he makes a call or two and next thing I know we're at an ATM he's taking money out and then driving to another dboys place so he can buy me a 40 to hold me over. Who does that???? Dude spent his own money just to help me get well till his stuff was ready to be picked up. This dude is a blessing. Never had a dealer that gave a shit about me in anyway at all let alone go out of their way to buy me a couple points to hold me over. Back in NY my dboy woulda just said tough shit, wait till 3. This is southern hospitality at its finest.\n\nHe did this yesterday too, bought me a 40 when we found out his plug wouldn't be liquid till today. So over two days he's been dry he spent $80 of his own money to keep me well till he would be good again. Granted we work together and he wants me able to work, and I sell a lot of H for him during the workday. I never expected him to come out of pocket like that, at all. He's a good dude for real, doesn't expect anything in return except my friendship which is s rare quality in humans these days especially in this scene. \n\nAnyway just felt like sharing while I wait now for 3pm to roll around. Feeling normal again, no more sweating and restless legs thankfully. \n\nHow's everyone else's day going so far? Any other lucky junkies out there today? I'd thank junkie Jesus but this was all my boss no junkie Jesus at all, so thanks to well let's call him Fred. Thanks \"fred\".!","201":"Okay so I been searching for a new spot to register a good shot, and I feel this nice lil guy on my left arm. So I stick needle in, and pull back and instantly register. As I'm plunging said shot in, I get this warm slightly burning sensation in that spot, so I stop shooting it in and pull back again to make sure I wasn't missing and draw in blood again, I repeat those steps a couple times before just saying fuck it and plunging it In before my blood coagulates. Everything was fine afterwards for the most part. Now this was around 7\/8pm...I just fixed up my bedtime shot and after poking around I end up back at my friend. So i stick her in, draw blood instantly(miracle!!). I start to plunge and I get the same warm burning sensation only stronger, I figure it's not gonna stop so I plunge it all in cause why not right? After I pull needle out, i still have the slight burning feeling and my arm is warm. I can't explain how my arm feels, it doesn't hurt but it feels like idk lol warm and weird it's hard to explain. I know i didn't miss cause i got an instant rush, and no bubble on my arm or reaction from missing. So what caused this?? I keep getting muscle twitches too since I hit. Artery?....Idk should I not use this vein anymore? If so, that Sucks cause this vein was a winner. What caused that burning pain? Thanks for any answers or input given!!","202":"I'm sure many of you have this problem as well. But over the past 10 days I wasn't able to take a shit to save my life. Normally after 4\/5 days I'll have a bowel movement but this time it just wasn't happening. I was using a lot of heroin though a lot more than normal over the past few weeks so that was obviously the cause. But anyway today I took a break to make myself start withdrawals just so I would be able to shit. I finally did thankfully cause I was about to give up and get high. My boss just dropped me off a nice bag so I was so tempted to just give in and stay constipated but I have it one last shot and it worked. My stool was huge and extremely hard I felt like I was shitting out rocks. It kinda hurt to get out I was pushing like I was giving birth lol my face was red and I had veins popping out of my forehead and neck pushing so hard. But my question was there was some blood in my stool when I wiped there was some red on the toilet paper. I was guessing it was from the stool being so deprived of water and making it hard and hard to get out it probably made a small tear or cut. Is this normal or is this something I should get checked out? A few years ago I had blood in my stool and I went to the hospital and I had an ulcer. This was a lot less blood and my stomach didn't hurt like when i had the ulcer. So is this normal?  ","203":"Is it just me, or is the absolute best place to boot up a nice shot and then smoke a cigarette sitting on the toilet taking a shit? Man I'm sitting here right now and I just thought \"wow this is so peaceful and serene\" I can't think of anywhere else I could peacefully do a shot and just have \"me\" time to contemplate life and what have you.

Well I was confused cause when looking up my name on our counties court website it said I had a failure to appear and the. It showed a new court date for September 23rd but didn't say anything about a bench warrant. I have been so paranoid about getting pulled over here in NC and getting extradited back to NY since all day for work we drive around to service calls and spend most of the day on the road so chances for a traffic stop are high. Having my boss be my dboy and our work truck being the trap truck as well didn't help me paranoia. So today I called the courts back in NY just to double check about my warrant and they transferred me to the warrant bureau. And to my surprise I have no warrants or anything under my name back in my old county. Even the warrant bureau the guy I talked to said it was weird cause there should be a bench warrant out for me if I missed my court date 10 days ago. He said he didn't understand why I didn't have one but he said it was my lucky day lol. So why do I not have a bench warrant yet? Has this happened to anyone else before? I'm sure eventually I'll have one but it's a huge sigh of relief to know if I get pulled over I can give my real name to the officer and not worry about getting locked up. I'm extremely happy cause now I can go get my NC I.D. And get my drivers license again down here with no worries for now. Thank you junkie Jesus amen.","205":"Oh. My. God. I cannot stop tweezing out hairs from my body and or picking at non existent pimples or black heads when I'm high. It's so annoying but I cannot stop doing it the minute I pick up these damn tweezers I don't stop lol. Every tiny lil hair I see has to be removed. And then when they start to grow back in, I go even harder trying so hard to tweeze out these tiny tiny minuscule little hairs starting to grow out. Why do I do this? Does anyone else have this OCD problem? It's only when I'm high. I just lit a cigarette and had it hanging from my mouth, the whole thing one long ash cause I didn't smoke it cause I was so focused on tweezing out these hairs on my stomach lol. WTF?! And then the \"pimples\" that's 90% of the time aren't even there I can see a small dot on my face and will rip at it until it becomes a blemish. I thankfully stopped doing this to my face besides here and there when I actually see a blackhead pop up or something but I do it to my shoulders(in highschool I had acne on my shoulders and back) and I almost make it all come back all over by pinching these little spots trying to see something pop out, and nothing ever does lol. I'll do it until I see clear pus come out that's only from irritating the area so much. This is the only thing I HATE about getting high and being bored. I start to search around for things on my body to destroy hAha. Please tell I'm not alone? ","206":"June 14th::: \n      My buddy calls me up and asks if I'm down to go out boosting one last time. We had a successful 4 month run. I knew I was about to move in 2-3 weeks. I thought this was a bad idea, but the thought of a nice fat shot was already implanted in my head. So being a junkie I said yeah fuck it lets go. So we head to Home Depot, and I go inside. Walk around fill my cart with a few things and throw my expensive 2 items I was gonna take off with in the front of my cart. I do this all very quickly and go by the register where there is a line. I Act as though I'm getting onto the line, and pickup my two expensive items and take off towards the door. Right as I get to the outside and I feel the sun on my face, I'm fucking tackled and there's 2 dudes already outfront waiting for me and they get on top of me. I try fighting them off me but to no avail. I'm a sick junkie trying to fight off 3 jacked security\/lost prevention guys. \n\nFucked. \n\nSo now all these thoughts of regret are filling my head as I'm being walked through the store with cuffs on, all these customers looking at me in disgust. Damn.... Then I realize I have a needle in my pocket. Damn what else could go wrong.... So they bring me to the back room and start asking me all these questions. What's your name? Who were you with? Are you a drug addict? Why did you go for this specific item? Etc.... They say listen we gotta have the cops come. They probably won't take you to the precinct though they usually write a citation for you to goto court and let you go from here. But my dumbass left my wallet with I.d in my buddies car so they were deff bringing me down to the precinct. Anyway they bullshit with me and tell me the whole everyone makes a mistake man it's not the end of the world. Yea whatever you say boss. \n\nThis whole time, I was slowly and quietly taking my needle out of my pocket and got it stashed under this plastic seat between the metal bars of the chair and the plastic. Cops show up. Take the cuffs from Home Depot off me and put their cuffs on. Ask for my I.d. And I tell em I didn't have it. Stand up lets go they say. Fuck me man. I stand up and start to walk and the Home Depot security gets up too and starts to walk behind me and accidentally the guy kicks the chair and my needle falls out from under it. FUCK. They all turn their heads and look at the syringe sitting right there. Fuck fuck fuck. Oh look what we have here the cop says and looks at me with fire in his eyes. Lol damn man can anything else go wrong? \n\nNowhere to go from here but up, I guess lmao fml. So they book me at precinct and set 50$ bail luckily and my buddy comes through and bails me out so I didn't have to call my folks with another help me out I'm in jail bullshit calls. Being the junkie I am, the minute I get bailed out, I head to my dboys house and beg for a spot telling him what had happened and thankfully he hooked me up with a half gram. All my troubles went away till the next morning.\n\nSo now this is where I'm at, they gave me a court date for August 12th in NY which was 2 days ago and I'm in NC and had no way of going to that court date at all. \n\nNow my question is how long till they issue a bench warrant? Will New York come and get me if I run into the cops down here in NC? I know NC won't extradite someone but idk if NY will.  Is a petit larceny and a hypodermic needle charge important enough to NY to extradite me back there? How long will NC hold me in jail if they don't wanna come get me for it? And how fucked do you think I am in terms of jail time from NY if they do come and get me? I do have prior offenses. Just beat a possession charge like 3 months ago. And before that I have 2 dwi charges that I did 8 months for back in 2010. no felonies on record thankfully though. What do y'all think? Need some serious input here. \n\nI couldn't find any websites I could finding i had a warrant out for me yet. No free ones at least. Any help in somewhere I could look up my warrant situation at would be helpful as well. Thanks community for any input y'all have!","207":"so I just replied to a comment on that picture of the naked wife with the dope cut into lines on her ass and crotch. Anyway I asked how I could IV off a girls body jokingly...and the thought popped into my head, how amazing would busting a nut and doing your shot at the same exact time would be? IV rush and orgasm might be the best feeling in the world lmao...you'd have to do it on your first shot though cause I doubt you'd bust a nut if you were already on the nod. Anyone ever do this?

Say you only have 2 or 3 bags for the night, you know you dont fall asleep till 4-6am. Would you rather do all the bags at once, and get a nice high, or only do half so you have another shot for later, or do most of it and save just a tiny bit along with your cotton so you can just do a baby shot before you crash or for the morning? I face this dilemma constantly and just boggled my mind on what to do again just now. Tonight i said fuck it and did all 3 at once but squirted the tiniest bit back on my cotton so i could do a morning shot for the sake of shooting something. Whats your guys input on this? is it even worth saving that tiny shot just for mental satisfaction of doing a shot and the possibility of prolonging your withdrawals? Or is one better off just doing all of it so you get to enjoy the high, or do half now half later to stretch it out and not get a great high but save yourself from feeling w\/d's for a lil while.....ehhh idk probably consider this a shit post but when i have like no money and can only afford a few bags i go through this problem.

He's done this to prevent me from going to the ER and it's working really well. Aside from 1 ER visit that led to a hospitalization last month, I haven't stepped into an ER in 2 months. \n\nThat's a big deal for me.\n\nSometimes I do want to abuse those 15mg tablets but knowing they are there for emergencies is outweighs my desire to abuse them. I guess knowing I'll be left with extreme pain if i abuse things creates an environment where  pain control becomes more important than feeling good just because.\n\nI just could never tell my sponsor any of this. All she knows is that Im on the Subutex.\n\nWhat I've been doing is living my best life to the best of my ability and using the Narcotics Anonymous program to help me improve as a person even though I'm not 100% clean in their eyes, I still feel there are parts of the program that I can and will benefit from.","217":"The title is basically the vibe I got from my doctor's office this morning.  \n\nI'm absolutely pissed off. \n\nI work 45minutes from where I live and I don't drive. So, I'm relliant on rides and Uber\/Lyft usually I dont mind this. \n\nExcept I accidentally left my Subutex this morning at home. 45 minutes away. Ugh. \n\nMy first thought was good news, I fill my script week by week and pay out of pocket for it. I'll just call CVS and have them transfer the script over from the CVS 45 minutes away to the CVS down the block from me and be fine. \n\nCVS down the block was surprisingly helpful in this situation. The pharmacist apologized because subutex is schedule 3 they cant pull it from one CVS to another but my doctor could call it in and have a days worth of it filled electronically if they're FDA approved. \n\nSo, I call my doctors office. I tell them what's up and the receptionist is more than nasty to me. \n\nI must've begged and pleaded with her for 10 minutes asking if anything could be done, if another doctor in the office could help. I asked her what her suggestion was. She told me to go to the ER or Urgent Care. I asked if that would get me kicked out of their office for filling with a different doctor. She told me that it probably would. \n\nFinally, I told her, \"Look Dr. X Wants to keep me OUT of the ER and if I dont come up with a solution you're asking me to get fired. Over something that could be solved with a phone call to the CVS down the road. I would like to speak with Dr. X regarding this matter now.\" She told me he was with patients and I told her I would wait on hold till he had a break. \n\nShe finally transferred me to his assistant.  I told her the same thing I told the receptionist. That I made a huge mistake, my bad, I accepted responsibility for it, but if she thought getting me fired over it when they had the power to solve the issue was an effective way to help someone rebuild their life and recover. Especially considering I'm not asking them to call in a months worth or a weeks worth. I'm asking them to call in 1days worth. \n\nI guess that did it because she had the doctor call the CVS down the road from me and I'll be picking it up on my lunch break. God willing. \n\nI cannot believe how much hassle that was. I'm floored by the treatment of that receptionist and I just think we all need to be treated with a little more respect.

I still use them to this day to help my pain, I just don't get that high sensation I used to. So, if you're a heavy H user you might not notice anything, but if you are in withdrawals, new to recovery or craving in recovery, they might be the solution you need.\n\n# What are Binaural Beats?\n\nBinaural beats therapy is an emerging form of soundwave therapy in which the right and left ears listen to two slightly different frequency tones yet perceive the tone as one.\n\nThe binaural auditory beat that a person hears is the difference in frequency between the left and the right ear and should be at frequencies lower than 1000 hertz (Hz) for the brain to detect the binaural beat.\n\nFor example, if the left ear registers a tone at 200 Hz and the right at 210 Hz, the binaural beat heard is the difference between the two frequencies \u2014 10 Hz. [\\[...Read More At The Source Here\\]](https:\/\/www.medicalnewstoday.com\/articles\/320019.php)\n\n# Can Binaural Beats Get You High?\n\nBinaural beats are precisely-designed audio tracks that claim to get you high by inducing the brainwave associated with particular controlled substances. It's totes legal.\n\nPredicated on the notion that binaural brainwaves are responsible for every conceivable state of consciousness, the tracks supposedly sync brainwaves to make you feel fine.

The very best headphones are the noise-cancelling ones, but they can be expensive.\n\nWhichever headphones you use, please make an effort to be kind to your ears: they\u2019re the only ones you get.

Lengthy exposure to sounds at or above 85 decibels can cause hearing loss over time. This is roughly the level of noise produced by heavy traffic.\n\nBinaural beat technology could be a problem if you have epilepsy, so you should speak to your doctor before trying it. More research is needed to see if there are any side effects to listening to binaural beats over a long period of time.\n\nSide Note: It's Not Recommended to Drive After Listening to Binaural Beats because it does impair you to some extent. [\\[...Read More At The Souce Here\\]](https:\/\/www.healthline.com\/health\/binaural-beats#side-effects)\n\n# In Closing\n\nYou can find free tracks for binaural beats on YouTube. This is an opiate one that I really like. I'd be curious if others could let me know what their experience was when they listened to binaural beats. I can imagine that collectively the results would be interesting. Especially from a bunch of addicts.\n\nRemember, listen with headphones. It's much more effective that way.","219":"I was wondering for all of those people out there that still frequent the darkside of reddit, but are clean, I want to know how did you do it? What keeps you motivated? How do you define yourself and what is the best thing about being off the drugs for you?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nFor me, I got off by ripping it off like a band-aid went cold turkey off a high dosage of oral Dilaudid that I was boofing. I ultimately got off the dope that way but my physical pain is enormous and the only thing that could destroy my recovery so, I'm now doing it with Subutex onboard. Although admittedly I regret getting on it and take the bare minimum to stay out of withdrawals from it. Simply because I mentally cannot handle withdrawals again. I've also been staying clean with the help of NA although I do feel like with the Subutex I'm not 100% honest. At the same time, my sponsor knows about it and I do what I can.\n\nI stay motivated by all the good things that have happened to me since I started this journey. I'm engaged, have a great job, and deal with less pain day to day than I ever did when I was using, so go figure. Although, there are days where a painkiller would really help and there have been days in recovery where I've needed it for things like spinal surgery.\n\nFor me, the best thing about being off of it is living life again. I have more energy, less pain, and feel more fulfilled. I thought I was living when I was using but, little did I know I think I was actually dying.","220":"This is sort of opioid-related.

More so than usual. I normally NEVER ask for opiates anymore because they don't give them to me and I don't really want them, I, however, always expected in an extreme situation they'd treat the human, not the addiction. \n\nWhelp. \n\nI was wrong.\n\nAt the ER I told the doctor I seriously needed pain relief that it was way beyond what I could physically cope with, that I need to be treated with dignity and properly. She tells me that she can look into getting me another Subutex dose. I tell her no, I really need a legitimate opioid right now. She goes, \"how about Torodol?\" So, I get that, and a little later I ask her why she can't give me a dose of pain medications for legitimate flares. She gives me a pamphlet that says, \"We don't give IV medications for flareups of chronic pain, but we do give oral medication instead.\" So, I asked for something oral and she told me no and walked off.\n\nI turned to the nurse and stated: \"All that does is make people want to use heroin.\"\n\nThe nurse then says: \"T***hen that's good because it's on you and not the doctor and the doctor's license.***\"  So I ask about the oath to do no harm and the nurse tells me he's not going to argue it with me.\n\nIt's so fucking disgusting.\n\nIDK The point of this ... I just needed to rant. I get it that I'm in recovery and that I'm not actively using, aside from Subutex, I'm just frustrated and angry that in legitimate situations I'm treated less than dog crap all because I made the decision to get off day to day opiates.","221":"I need to take a quick moment here to say and acknowledge the fact that I'm EXCEPTIONALLY proud of myself.\n\n# 160 Days Clean\n\nSince a falling out with my sponsor around 90 Days Clean, I haven't been attending Narcotics Anonymous very much.

However, after our falling out I offered an olive branch and acted as a reference for her so she could at least find employment after I had to kick her out of our apartment. \n\nI've seen her a few times at functions with friends and have always been corgel with her. To be fair when she left the apartment I had paid 3 months worth of her rent, so she owed me big time.\n\nWell, sure enough 3 weeks ago I found out she was looking for someone to replace her at the non-profit she was working at. Despite knowing nothing about Accounts Payable, my friend talked me up to her boss as well to the CEO of the non-profit. I interviewed on a Monday and started that Wednesday.\n\nSo, my old roommate actually came through on her word that she'd make it up to me. She really out did herself. This is my first grown up job and while the work is NOTHING I'm passionate about, it's an easy job that I love. Especially with the down time I get. Today I was so caught up on everything, I got paid to just hang out and play on my phone.\n\nOh &amp; my job pays in money. So, i'm slowly digging myself out of debt from my gambling and drug addictions.\n\n# My Health\n\nIt's been 35 days since I last went to the ER which, is really excellent for me. Sure there have been days where i could've gone into the ER, but overall, I'm doing tons and tons better. I'm pushing through the distress of my vomiting too. Like my first day at work I vomited in the work bathroom 5-7 times. I seriously should've gone to the ER, I normally would've gone, but not messing up on my first day was really important to me. My friend was training me and covered for me - so no one but her knew i was sick that day.\n\nAnyway, I'm excited things are getting better.","222":"When I first joined r\/opiates i was seeking advice on how to deal with my brother's death from a heroin overdose.

My longest time \"clean\" since my 90 Days from November - February 2018 was 65 over summer.\n\n**Today I can safely say I am legitimately 90 days clean.** \n\nI am also excited because I get to pick up a 90-day chip and I've never gotten that one before. From November - February 2018 - I white-knuckled it. So, I'm also excited about getting a 90-day chip. I'll likely pick it up tomorrow though. Even though it'd be neat to get it on the exact day, getting to a meeting today seems a bit difficult.\n\n# Also, may I say a few words about Narcotics Anonymous?\n\n***No? Okay, thanks, I will anyway...***\n\nI used to shit on that program so much. I used to hate it and think everyone there was a delusional brainwashed religious nut job who took everything to the extreme. After getting involved in it, I discovered it is actually a super useful program that provided me with a new way of looking at life. I was stunned by how much fun the fellowship of NA is and am super lucky to have a strong fellowship where I live.\n\nAs for the religious side of NA here is a little summary of what NA really is when it comes to your higher power or religious beliefs: [https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/5V6xKnJ.jpg](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/5V6xKnJ.jpg)\n\nFor instance, for me, my \"higher power\" is this concept that you get back what you put out into the world. If you put a lot of good in - you'll ultimately get good back. I take negative experiences as, \"not as bad as I think they are\" and \"a learning experience,\" it really helps me cope with day to day life and so much higher power is simply the idea that I am not in control of what happens, but I am capable of making good &amp; healthy decisions.\n\n# 90 days is a lot but at the same time, it isn't!\n\nLet's see, in the last 90 days, my life has changed dramatically...\n\n* I got Engaged\n* I moved into a larger 1 Bedroom for cheaper than my studio! Say WAT?!\n* I've gained a lot of my Family's trust back in me\n* My average number of ER visits is rapidly on the decline\n* I'm learning alternative measures to my pain problems\n* I'm starting my own website\/online business entity\n* I finished Step #1 &amp; admitted to being an addict\n* &amp; I bought a whole bunch of nice furniture for my new place, because I could afford i\n\nThat's a lot of chance imho for 90 days! \n\nAnyway, yea that's what's up. I am living my best life - CLEAN!","225":"2018.\n\nWoah-WOW much?\n\nThis year was incredible for me. Which is saying a lot because I suffer from Schizoaffective Disorder w\/Major Depression Subtype. I used to be suicidal. In 2017 I thought for sure I wouldn't live to be 30. Yet here I am. 30 and going strong. Having gotten the chance to see how well my life can and is turning out makes me so happy that I was never successful in any suicide attempts or acted on any rash thoughts. I was killing myself slowly though. With narcotics. Which I am now off of and it feels so good.\n\nHere's all that happened:\n\n1. I got ENGAGED to my boyfriend after 1 year\n2. I got off of my prescription narcotic medication\n3. I paid off $10,000 worth of debt\n\nWhile it is \"only\" three accomplishments, there's a lot that goes into each one. Especially getting off of the narcotic medication. That was a big deal and quite painful to do in the first place let alone maintain it. I still hurt every day, but at least I am free from being dependant on a little pill.\n\nI have some goals for 2019 now:\n\n1. Lose 45-50 Pounds\n2. Get the Wedding Planned for 2020\n3. Stay off the Narcotic Medications\n4. Pay off the Remaining $20,000 Debt I have\n5. Re-Launch my Website on Chronic Illness\n\nIt's good to have goals. Along with goals I am also grateful.

I'm really proud of him right now.","227":"Hey r\/opiates ... 8 years ago today my brother died of a heroin overdose. He was 20 years old. His shit was mixed with fentanyl and it killed him. Not to mention he OD'd and was narcan'd 2 nights before his death. I miss him terribly. It's really hard for me without him. We were just growing out of that \"teenage I hate you\" phase and into respectable adults. His death rocked my world and still does. Anyway, yeah I wanted to share.","228":"My doctor recommended the Butrans Patch, but it needs to go through prior authorization with my insurance and that can take up to two weeks if not longer.\n\nSo in the meantime, he scripted me 8mg pills of Subutex he told me to cut them down to quarters and start there.  He wrote for a two week supply 2x\/day so 30 pills of 8mgs, but my insurance only covers 7 days worth so I got 14 pills instead. \n\nLuckily I'll be cutting them into halves and fourths so I won't need to get more than '7 days worth' each month until we can petition the insurance and get them to either approve the Butrans patch or whatever. If I like the Subutex I can work with him to stay on that versus the Butrans patch, but he's totally willing to give me a hand with everything which is helpful. \n\nIf I get on the Subutex regularly and we can get the insurance to allow more than '7 days worth' then I can stockpile it and never be truly out unlike what would happen with my regular oxycodone.\n\nAlso, I'm debating not telling my sponsor about this. I don't feel like being judged in NA for needing this right now, but I know I need the program itself to get better overall.","229":"I'm 28-Days sober and really just want to break down and get opiates. Luckily I have no money and no way of getting them legally. So, I'm doing the best I can, but I'm struggling with the pain issues.

I just wish it was different.","230":"Hello Everyone,\n\nI still haven't reached \"Kid\"  this is my last update on this until something new happens. \n\nI sent a letter roughly 20 days ago to the address I had on file. I suspect his family received the letter and likely sent me a glitter bomb in the mail. Which means, they probably don't want to talk to me. So, I won't be sending any more letters. I really miss KID and am hoping for the best but the more I think about it the more I worry.\n\nThanks for listening,\n\nDori","231":"I wasn't happy on the opiates and I'm not happy off of them. I rather be on them than deal with this pain. I don't know if I'm just a wuss or what but geesh I can't stand it anymore.","232":"Firstly, I've been Sober.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI've been feeling badly for 2+ days. 1 day ago I went to a place that does IV hydration\/toradol\/zofran that was a nurse practitioner. Spent $200 on it to avoid the ER\/Hospital. It helped a little but less than 24hrs hours later I was vomiting at 4am-8am six times. All bile greenish\/yellowish and foamy. It really upset my entire stomach. I got to the ER at 9am and wasn't seen till 11am. After that, I was in the ER from 11am - 6pm before being moved up to a room. \n\nNo pain medications. There was a request to have pain management at the hospital see me for non-narcotic management which may or may not involve ketamine, but they didn't see patients past 5pm for that so I was SOL with that.\n\nAt this point I've been writhing in pain for days. I tried to go through the appropriate channels and have my nurse call my doctors to prescribe me something just to get through to the morning. None of them would because GI had a massive note in my chart not to give me pain medication.\n\nLike I know pain medication isn't the answer but sitting at a solid 8 of pain for so many hours gets wearing and I finally lost it. I called up my internist and was like, \"what am I supposed to do here?!\" then, my GI called me back because I had left a very exasperated message on his voicemail and was all like \"we don't want to lead you back to drugs.\" I was just like again, \"what choice do I have? Will a one time dose really get me back into or onto the drugs?\" He eventually conceded and was all \"fine one dose.\" \n\n&amp; I got it.\n\nPlus, it worked - did it's job. Helped break the pain cycle and I don't think I need anymore of the narcotic. I'm just sick of walking around in a 6 pain score and then being treated badly when i'm in an 8+ because I made the decision to get off the narcotics on my own. \n\nIDK\n\nShitpost.","233":"This update is really just to **THANK** this community *so much*.

If I can obtain that address I'll write to him in about a week and hope for the best\/an update of somesort.\n\nI'm just super worried. At this point I think he's in a psych ward or hospital or something because no obituary information is coming up and nowhere am I finding that he's in jail\/prison again or arrested.

So I'm asking the stupid question here.\n\nI had a drug test at my doctors office to make sure I didn't test for anything off the wall or illicit.

So, me being me, and being super paranoid about random drugs showing up tests herself with one of her dori instant tests at home.\n\nI came up positive for exactly what I thought I would:\n\n* THC - likely a low level of it since I rarely EVER smoke &amp; am in a legal state\n* Benzos - Duh, I've been on valium post op\n* Opiates - Yes, I've been on those consistently, since surgery but will be out in a day or two. MmmmK.\n* Suboxone was inconclusive .... my last dose was 45 days ago so likely a non issue.\n\nHere's where I'm concerned:\n\nMethadone. I tested fucking positive for methadone. I would fly to australia if someone put methadone in front of me so I KNOW it's a false positive. What I don't know is if lab testing will reveal that or ??? I've scoured the web looking for things that can cause a false methadone positive and so far the only thing that came up that it MIGHT be the benadryl. With that said, the only other thing i can think of is that it must've been in the heroin I tried 67 days ago but I highly doubt it would be THAT long lasting in my system?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHELP!\n\n&amp;#x200B;","237":"Ughhhhhhhhhhh I just found out today that the screws in my neck plate are loose.

Especially with my severe stomach problems.\n\nMy arm is weak, pins&amp;needles and has shooting pain. The neurosurgeon already referred me to pain management. I intend to be as honest as humanly possible with the neurosurgeon about my history. This is the last thing I needed in my sobriety.

With that said, if we list all the months from December to September it's been 10 months total. \n\nIf we add up my entire clean time since I very first made the decision to get clean we have 90 days, 45 days, and 30 days which equals 165 days of clean time.\n\n***That means I've spent 5.5 months clean out of the 10 months I've been serious about this.***\n\nThat simple realization means a whole heck of a lot to me.\n\nDunno, wanted to share. It's the first time I've been this clean in the 5 years I've been using\/prescribed narcotics. I thought it was noteworthy.","239":"I tried getting on Suboxone for pain management\/Drug Addiction issues but the dose was so strong (even at its lowest of 2mgs once a day) that it knocked me out for 12hrs at a time and I was sleeping 16-18hr days. So the psychiatrist said not to use the suboxone that it was giving me no life, *She said I needed pain management again like normal...*  \n\n\n**BUT Parents said no to pain management (don't want me back on pills) and insisted something be done. Plus I know a few doctors on my team don't want me in pain management....or on the pills.**  \n\n\nThey did add an antidepressant (Wellbutrin) in addition to the Prozac to work on other neurotransmitters and give me some energy.   \n\n\nSo right now we're at a point where I think I'm going to try to use **Marijuana** **to manage the pain** when its intense and call it a day because I can't keep doing this to myself.","240":"[Original Post\n](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/8q6byk\/im_checking_into_the_hospital_tonight\/)\n\nI went to one hospital which referred me to another. I was completely suicidal and verbalized this to both hospitals. The first one gave me a package of resources to call for the withdrawal\/suicidality, and the second one told me they thought  I was lying about suicide and since I had, had an evaluation 10 days before (where they really should've hospitalized me) that I wasn't eligible for a new psych evaluation.\n\nI was beyond devastated and nearly got hit by a car over it because I flung myself into traffic hoping to get hit. The police were called and they tried to reason with the ER but again all the ER did was print out paperwork for me to call myself and wouldn't call psych. Even with police involvement. I kept saying I just need help and they kept saying that I didn't meet the criteria for suicide and that they would not give me opiates. I repeated that I just wanted to withdraw safely with my suicidality and chronic illness it wasn't safe to do it outpatient. \n\nSome 25-year-old doctor whose ego was way bigger than his reasoning skills just said no and referred me to another ER.\n\nI got home slept 4hours and then decided to go see a doctor I trust - my hematologist - he helped me with IV meds for that day and right after my appointment with him went to the 3rd hospital. The ER there was great. They helped the withdrawal immensely with clonidine, 1mg Ativan 50mg Benadryl 4mg Zofran, 30mg Toradol, and so forth that I slept like a baby for a little bit.\n\nThey decided to hospitalize me on the psych unit there 72-hour hold. They didn't allow IVs on this unit and I might as well have been going cold turkey because I kept vomiting up the oral medication they gave me. I got very little out of that hospitalization. about 60 hours in they broke the hold early &amp; I revisited their ER just to stabilize my situation.\n\nNow here I am \n\n4days and 5 hours since I last used. I'm out of the woods withdrawal wise, but now everyone wants me to go to a 30day rehab. I'm very much so against that. I'll do an IOP but not inpatient\/residential and I think it'll work for me because they'll be able to work around any work schedule I may have. I think it'll work out well. IOPs are typically covered insurance wise whereas 30-day stays are not and half the reason I want to so many ER places is that we were trying to do it covered by my insurance all the detox places would've cost us $2,000 and up.\n\nAnyway, I'm off the drugs again (YAY!) but I'm in incredible amounts of pain. I'm hoping that subsides soon.","241":"Right now I'm on a bus home. In 1.5 hours I'll be \"home\" I'm going directly to the emergency room. Due to my complex medical history, and current suicidal mood, I'm hoping they admit me to detox me off the narcotics. \n\nI cannot physically cope anymore with my illness and coexisting drug addiction. \n\nI am going to go to one hospital tonight and then if they discharge me from the ER there, I'm going to another one. Basically hospital shopping to get off the drugs because I cannot stand it anymore.\n\nIn other news, life keeps beating me up. I got an online gig and missed the submission deadline by 3 hours a timezone change issue and they fired me then and there. So the moment I get something promising I get kicked down. \n\nMade me so bitter.\n\nI think I'm bitter in general though. Everything is such a shitshow right now. \n\nThat is all.

He has been involved in illegal tax schemes, businesses, and fraud since he was a teen. As his daughter, he made a point of keeping my record clean. He has then used it and abused it to run illegal fraudulent operations. Recently there was a raid, and crap and police showed up and arrested me (dad was conviently out of the country) and a lot of shit went down. I got released on bail and now I'm super pissed at my dad because I could be facing 25 to life for something I know nothing about, never did but my name is attached to. \n\nChances are the blame will all fall on him.

Lyft called me and informed they suspended the driver that prompted the altercation because he placed his hands on me and stomped on my phone. They wanted me to file a police report but I declined because I don't trust law enforcement...\n2. The Hospital\/Hospitalist was able to get in touch with my pain specialist who was okay with the doctor prescribing me 10 pills to get me until Friday. I am being very careful about not blow through them because I desperately need them and a fuck it attitude is not going to be helpful at all. That attitude nearly killed me this week.\n3. I'm assuming (hoping) things will work out with my pain doctor which is good.\n4. Despite still feeling suicidal I'm feeling slightly better and less stressed which is also good. Life is just hard. I'm stressed out.\n5. Not all went to hell I was able to reschedule an interview for after this hospitalization mess - I desperately need a job.\n6. After my interview, I may go visit my boyfriend at his job site 5hrs away from me. He's there for 6 months so that's making things hard.\n\nI need to figure out my life. I'm thinking about getting into more regular counseling again, picking up biofeedback again, seeing about doing mindfulness and picking up a job again because I really need income again. My finances are a mess and I think that's adding stress to my situation.","244":"I don't know what went wrong. I don't know why I can't cope, just that I can't anymore. I ran out of medication 2 weeks early and let my pain specialist a voicemail. Frantically tried to reach him for day and no response. Decided to just go through with the withdrawal cold-turkey and but even stopped by his office on Friday to see if he was there to at least leat help me through this but, \"no he just left for the day\" is the answer I got.\n\nSo I go downstairs to call a lyft and get home. lyft shows up and the driver asks how I am, I give him a way to honest answer: \"Not fucking great, I just want to get home\" he goes, \"I don't take negativity in my car get the fuck out.\" I'm like \"WTF\" but  throw my bag out he passenger window and he aggressively gests out-out of the car to drag me out IDK I check the car to make sure my stuff is out my cell phone falls to the ground he stomps on it, we start yelling and getting into it when I blow.\n\nI dart and run across 6 lanes of active busy rush hour traffic yelling and hoping someone hit me. somehow, I get all the way across and my stuff is still on the other side so I figure  I'd go play in traffic again and I run across 6 lanes again and somehow make it safely across. \n\nI hear sirens. I figure they're for me so I book it up to my other doctor's office (not pain management) who I figure will give me a hand and advise me he does. I end up going to a psychiatric based hospital that doesn't admit me for psych reasons because they feel my actions are very pain driven. \n\nSo here I am now feeling depressed as fuck and hospitalized for medical reasons not knowing what to do or think.","245":"Anyway around and wanna chat? I'm trying to get sober, but it's so fucking hard with all the pain issues I'm dealing with.

Getting IV Fluids, and hopefully some Ativan and Torodol too. Working on asking the right people here for the meds I need.

I\u2019m really pissed about it, but at the same time it might not be a bad thing. My tolerance was becoming unmanageable and I really rather not be on the pills. The only issue\/problem I\u2019ll have is when I flare up. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do then, but I\u2019m gonna have to stay away from opiates. Last time PAWS and a Flare is what caused my relapse and descent back into this hell hole. So it might be nice to get out of it. I\u2019m just conflicted. Any thoughts?","248":"So, back in November, I got clean. It lasted 90 days, just short of 100 before I had a pancreatic flare and ended up hospitalized again. They administered pain medication and my doctor put me back on a regular script. Then, my damned doctor decided he was getting out of the pain management business so 2 weeks after being put back on a steady script I had to find a new doctor. That was a pain in the ass and made me so mad that I was even back on these medications.\n\nSince then, I've fallen quite hard back into old addiction-like habits and just wish I could manage my life without narcotics. I really don't see myself on these things forever and having an addiction is SO EXPENSIVE. \n\nSo, here's my thought - I need to get clean. I just do. \n\nExcept I'm so nervous for what withdrawals will do to me yet again. It's such a hard process to go through and can be a bit expensive if you use a medical detox facility. \n\nI'm thinking of cutting costs by seeing my hematologist\/cancer specialist. I don't have cancer, he sees me for anemia issues, but his office offers IV hydration and any medication you might need from IV pain meds to chemotherapy. Each visit costs me $150 though, but seeing him 5 times from Monday - Friday is a lot cheaper than going to a medical detox facility.\n\nI already have clonidine at home from last time, and all I would need is a script for something like Valium and possibly a muscle relaxant.\n\nI don't know. I'm just typing out thoughts. Can anyone else add in anything that might be useful. I just want to be 100% sure about this because I don't exactly want to fail AGAIN.","249":"I thought it'd be fun to do a bit of Q&amp;A with you guys so here are the questions:\n\n1. How Old Are You?\n2. What is your DoC?\n3. What is your biggest fear?\n4. What is your proudest accomplishment?\n5. If you had a endless supply of money what would you do outside of buying all the drugs ever?\n\nFor me here it goes:\n\n1. I'm in my late 20s\n2. I am currently on Dialudid\n3. Death &amp; Prison are my biggest fears\n4.  Getting in and graduating from a top 20 school (bragging rights!)\n5. If I had an endless supply of money, I'd open my own record label.","250":"Okay so the ER Doctor wouldn't listen to me, but at least I was finally employed with a job I liked. Unfortunately, I got a call today that they lost two major clients and couldn't afford to keep my position open. Evil thing. I'd only been working a week. Now I'm FREAKING out about my finances again. FML. \n\nCan I just check out from real life for the next year-eternity. That'd be nice wouldn't it???","251":"[Original Post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/8f9ze6\/ever_been_in_so_much_pain_you_just_wished_you\/)\n\nTurns out the ER doctor straight up lied to me. I went to see my pain specialist yesterday morning and he said he never denied me access to care in the ER. He said he received an angry call from the ER doctor telling him he shouldn't be prescribing me anything and that I was in there faking my illness. \n\nSo apparently the whole, \"you're under pain management and your new contract for all his patient's states emergency care is off the table\" rant by the ER doctor was an entire lie.\n\nSomeone who had seen me for less than 5 minutes made the determination I was lying and then called my regular doctors to tell them I was in there lying. Apparently, according to my pain specialist, he doesn't recommend I ever go back to that hospital again because the note is so severe he doesn't think I'll ever get adequate treatment again. \n\nI've been treated at this hospital for almost 10 years now. \n\nI'm slowly becoming increasingly suicidal. IDK what to do. At all.","252":"I figured since things sometimes get dark around here we oughta lighten the mood with some fun jokes.

I've got my own boyfriend, a new place, and a job. Life is finally moving along smoothly. I'm still on the opiate script for 2mg dilaudids 3x\/day which isn't enough, but beggars can't be choosers right? Overall though I don't think it matters how much medication I do or do not have, I'm still gonna be in pain. I just wont be in pain AND withdrawals now. Anyway, sending everyone love and hope you too are swimming on your own :-).","254":"My pain specialist is getting out of the pain management business. Which means, I now no longer have a pain doctor. This was super fusterating and with just a month to find one I freaked out a bit. I finally was able to snag an appointment for the 2nd of April with someone so hopefully, that goes well.\n\nSimultaneously I started to flare super badly. Vomiting violently multiple times and having bad bowel movements. I couldn't handle it. I went down to the ER and ended up being admitted because my labs were all over the place. Since my pain specialist is no longer my doctor I got assigned to the regular in-house pain team here at the hospital.\n\nI realized I was essentially abusing and go through my script way fast taking closer to 30mgs of oxycodone versus the perscribed 10mgs. Bad. I know, but I was really trying to avoid being in the hospital and I ended up here anyway.\n\nWell, as you can imagine I was very nervous to talk to the in-house pain team about this. i explained to the doctor, \"I was perscribed 10mgs but was really needing 30mgs in a day and now I'm flaring and its hard to keep it under control\" to my surprise he organized my pain meds to match what I was used to versus what I was prescribed and has promised to send me home with a comparable script. He also recommended I do a ketamine infusion. Which, I am now scheduled to do tomorrow. I'm super nervous about it, but hopefully, all goes well.\n\nOn top of that, I should be getting some good recommendations for pain specialists. So, that's a bonus\/plus too.","255":"There was a time in my life where I sincerely believe suicide was the only answer for me. After my brother's passing that was no longer a viable option and never will be. Today, I appreciate being alive and was wondering if anyone felt the same way? Even though it's hard, life is beautiful.","256":"My pain specialist will no longer be my doctor as of June. He's taking on workers compensation patients only from then on out. To say I'm very stressed out by this is an understatement. I have a list of new doctors to call to transfer the prescription to someone new, but then I've noticed myself slipping on my current script yet again. I don't know if my pain is being inadequately managed or if I'm just a fiend or probably both. But, what can I do? \n\nI'm at this point seriously considering going on methadone permanently, but I'm super scared to do that. The last time I was on that my doctor decided it wasn't working, pulled me off it and I became near suicidal and my bones hurt so badly for months afterward.\n\nI'm starting to get really scared about things.","257":"Heya Kid,\n\nWe met online, we've never met in person. For two years we've exchanged so many phone calls and texts that we know all of each other's secrets. I call you kid even though you're just a few years younger than me and your like surrogate little bro to me know. I love you so g'dmd much.\n\nAnyway, today, you turned yourself into police for an outstanding warrant you had. I know you're going to suffer some really hardcore withdrawals, and it's going to fucking suck ass. Guess what though? I'll be writing you soon. I'll send you mail, might even throw some money on your commissary.\n\nIt's scary going to jail. It's TERRIFYING to withdraw in jail. I hope all goes well for you. I hope you get out sooner than later, but we don't know. &amp; for the record, I don't think you're an awful person. I think drugs just fuck us all up. \n\nEven me, they even fucked me up too. I'm hoping for nothing but the best for you.\n\nEven though you can't see this I want to send you warm hugs, well wishes, and lotsa love.

Might head down to the ER or just fucking relapse at this point because the ER is a NIGHTMARE. I dunno guys. Halp.","259":"When it comes to opiates it's like you are taking out a big HAPPY loan with an outrageously high-interest rate.\n===\n\nI took this from someone who stole it from someone here so I apologize for the lack of credit but I figure it's a shower thought worth thinking about.\n\nEDIT: \/u\/MissGyp is the [OP of this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/7v0w46\/fml\/dtomyes\/) &amp; a friend of mine who frequents here but doesn't have an account currently is the one who stole it from me who couldn't remember where he ripped it of from. So blame him.","260":"I've actually been here closer to a week. Been a bit too depressed to post about to post about it. Anway, I had to have an endoscopy where they found an overproduction of bile juice in my stomach corroding my stomach lining. now that we know what's up we're working on getting me ready for discharge. \n\nI want to go home on no opiates but that's unrealistic since I've been here for a week on IV Dilaudid to start followed by oxycodone every 6hrs at 10mgs.\n\nToday we dropped the oxycodone to one-night time dose of 10mgs. I'm hoping to get discharged today. Might still have to do a taper on the opiates outpatient but, I am unsure.","261":"I'm back in the hospital. I've been here nearly a week. Right now I'm getting Oxycodone 5mgs every 6hrs. The pain is outlandish and nausea is intense too. I'm considering seriously hitting up a friend when I get outta here and just buying some pills again. I'm not sure, I don't know, I feel like I'm falling. Juggling pain and addiction is one helluva beast. Right now I'm dealing with severe pain. I already got a breakthrough dose of medication from my doctor earlier today but, I don't think he'd go for a second one. my whole upper abdomen feels like someone is stabbing it with a firey poker that wraps around my shoulder blades. argh grrrr. shitpost had to rant.","262":"I *crashed* hard at 3 p.m., today napped all the way to 6 p.m. Now It's 2:30 a.m., and I've been having intense anxiety for about oh let's say 1.5hrs now. I can't seem to regulate my intense stress levels over trivial matters.\n\n* I'm a little financially strained, meaning I have no room for fun or relaxing\/extra stuff because I'm trying to pay back some old debts by June. \n* I'm having bad opiate cravings for no reason and it's kinda making e angry about things. Not lying though, if opiates were available to me I'd take them.\n* I only have 5mg of valium left. I figure it's for reasons or nights like these where I'm stressed out but what if I use and need more tomorrow? WTF am I going to do then!?!!??!!?!?\n* &amp; other bullshit like that is on my mind.\n\nI'm adamant about not relapsing. This is insane shit....tho....staying sober isn't even a little easy o fuccccccckkkkk.","263":"So, I got discharged from the hospital today. For roughly 5 days -\/+ a day or two  I was getting 1mg of IV Dilaudid 3x\/day or every 8hrs. \n\nI had been off the opiates for 40ish days before requiring this hospitalization for my pancreatitis. It was (&amp; still is) a fine balance between not torturing myself and handling the potential for relapse.\n\nI made the decision to not take home any pills because I didn't want temptation laying about for me to overuse. Luckily i have a ton of Lyrica, a bit of Valium &amp; my doctor prescribed me Clonodine to help at night. \n\n\nHow bad do you guys think this will be. I'm a bit anxious about it but I figure it can't be as bad as the 10-day withdrawal I had coming off a 3-year habit which peaked at an average of 60mg of oxycodone in a day ya know?  I've been 40 days off so and only needed it for 5 days with 3mgs of Dilaudid in a day......during those 4 days so hopefully, this is a breeze.","264":"So as you all know I've been off the opiates for 40ish days now. Well, my psychiatrist has also been prescribing me TEN 5mg tablets of Diazepam every 30 days. Just to help with sleepless nights as my body rests it's pain scores in the next 30-40 days. I don't &amp; haven't been taking it daily but today I needed it and was out of it and due for a refill.\n\nSo, my Dr called it in and I picked it up. I got home and took what I thought was a 5mg tablet because I had been having muscle spasms and needed a little sleep. However, I slept for 5hours so when I woke up I grabbed the script and checked it out. \n\nTurns out the pharmacy prescribed me WAYYYY more than they should have. They did THIRTY 10mg diazepam tablets!!! I was shocked. It's like Junkie Jesus is trying to drag me back into hell.\n\nSo, I called my doctor and was like, \"uhhhh yah I have way more pills than I should\" He advised I take 5 out for the month, and give the rest to my parents to give me 5 tablets every 30 days for the next 6 months. Since I now basically have a 6 month supply of it. \n\nThe instruction now is to break them in half to make them 5mg tablets. Knowing me I'll probably make 2.5mg tablets by breaking them into 4ths.\n\nAnyway, my dilemma now is that even though I've been honest about it with my doctor IDK if I really want my parents holding onto them. In the past, they've denied me access to medications (opiates) that I've needed and its always a fight. I don't want to get back into counting pills with them either. So, dunno. What do I do?","265":"Without being location specific I live in an area that's engulfed in flames. I'm close to ~~in a MANDATORY evacuation zone.~~ I'm packing my shit. \n\nMy parents are going fucking *lalalallalalalalalalaa*, I won't leave them. I can't handle that. We still have electricity and everything, but there's a fire that is 10 min east of me. \n\nAccording to a friend on the fire department, all it takes is one good gust and 1,000 arches goes up in flames. I have a few of your phone numbers, I'm writing a list of important numbers down on paper, if people don't hear from me, **10-days off the opiates and I'm dead.** I will provide my real life name to a few of you. This is fucking scary.\n\nNeedless to say I'm scared, but hopefully, my father can get us the fuck out once police start rolling down our streets and the loud phones blare.\n\nPS: I'm charging TWO external batteries to keep phone battery going. while I can. So, I'll be in touch best I can. \n\nUPDATE: The MANDATORY EVACUATION ZONE IS 5 MILES FROM ME. I EXPECT TO BE IN THAT ZONE BY NOON. I WILL NOT, WILL NOT, WILL NOT LEAVE MY PARENTS. I JUST WON'T.\n\nUPDATE #2: I'm monitoring the situation closely, I'm personally packed and ready &amp; so is the dog, right now I'm just hanging out trying to calm myself down. I put a bell on my pup along with his collar so if he hides I can find him. \n\nMight just throw the leash on him as a precautionary but I don't want him excited thinking he's going somewhere, he's already all kinds of nervous because I am. \n\nI have 2 suitcases &amp; 4 small bags packed up and ordered by importance. If anything I can throw some of the small bags into the larger suitcase and downsize it but right now yah.\n\nUPDATE #3: I PERSONALLY HAVE EVACUATED DOG AND MEDS IN HAND. MOMS PREPPING THE HOUSE IF THERES AN EVACUATION ORDER AND WILL LEAVE. THE SMOKE WAS WAY TOO HEAVY FOR ME AND I ALREADY HAVE A RESPITORY INFECTION.\n\n**final update for Wednesday**: I am completely safe sound my parents have refused to leave. If the fire spreads overnight I will know about it I have friends on watch for me on the East Coast that will call me if conditions change. \n\nIn the meantime i see my doctor for my respitory infection tomorrow morning. The smoke hasnt helped.","266":"Oh, my goodness guys. This hasn't been easy. Look what you made me do. *(bonus points if you catch the cheesy reference)* \n\nI originally joined r\/opiates roughly 5 years ago. Mainly to gain insight into my brother's Heroin addiction and death. As I gained that insight I was ultimately getting sick myself. It took a year to diagnose me with a rare condition that has led to chronic pancreatitis and what I still expect is a lifetime of pain.\n\nFor 4-5 years I've been on and off the opioids and for the last 3 years I've been on them nonstop. \n\nDuring my opiate career I've had two boyfriends both non-users. The first would berate me over my addiction and pain problems but was a complete alcoholic. Double standards much? I think so. \n\nThe 2nd boyfriend came within the last four months. He's been very sweet and we've been talking a lot about my health especially since I was starting to consider a need to get off the opiates even a few months before we met. \n\nHowever, as time with him went on and I got to a point where things were do or die for me, myself, I &amp; my future with this new guy. ^(you know how you know it's the one? That's how I feel about this guy) \n\nSo, when I ran out of my script 5 days early and had no money to supplement it, I made a difficult decision. I jumped off the medication cold turkey.\n\nI was on an average of 70mgs of the stuff before I went something like this:\n\n* Day 1: 50mgs\n* Day 2: 40mgs\n* Day 3: 35mgs\n* Day 4: 25mgs\n* Day 5: 0mgs\n\nI consumed my last dose at 7pm on November 25th, 2017. Ironically, if we turned the clock back 7 years my brother would be alive for another 5 days before he'd die of his Heroin OD. I would be clean &amp; sober the day of his death for the first time in 5 years. It's kinda spooky to me and means something. I don't know I've always believed in dates and time and things like that, that everything is connected for a reason and sometimes ***what you think is bad isn't always the worst thing. Sometimes it's even good***.\n\nWith that said I've been battling a Kidney Infection plus my period on top of the withdrawal so needless to say it's been intense. Since quitting some big things I've done are as follows:\n\n1. Declined Narcotics at my Drs. Office\n2. Flushed a 10mg Oxycodone Tablet Down the Toliet\n3. Declined my usual refill &amp; declined a muscle relaxant as well\n4. informed all my Doctors of the change\n\nI am becoming a new person. Entirely. They say every 7 years your cells regenerate to make you new again and 7 years past my brother's death, I am finally new again.","267":"Heya Bropiates. After meeting with the 2nd opinion pain management appoint last week I flew over 400 miles a week later on short notice to be seen by the addiction specialist.\n\nThe specialist wanted me to start a Buprenorphine patch which I am 100% willing to do and want to do despite the potential for a seizure. \n\nI had a seizure once when I tried a 2mg\/0.5mg suboxone film. They think the 0.5mg naloxone in the Buprenorphine and the high dose of Buprenorphine caused me to have a seizure along with the potential of other drugs in my system.\n\nThey think microgram dosing of the Buprenorphine in a patch would be perfect for me. At first I was nervous about doing this but after meeting with the addiction specialist she recommended a few things:\n\n1. USE THE PATCH IN CONJUNCTION WITH MY CURRENT 30MG NARCOTIC DOSE WITHOUT ANY CHANGES EXCEPT ADDING THE LOW DOES PATCH.\n2. DO IT ALL INPATIENT IN THE EVENT OF A POTENTIAL SEIZURE\n3. EVENTUALLY WEEN OFF THE NARCOTIC AND JUST BE ON THE BUPRENORPHINE PATCH\n4. GET OFF EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE BUPRENORPHINE WHEN THE TIMING IS RIGHT FOR EVERYTHING ABOUT 1.5-2.5 YEARS FROM NOW. \n\nI do eventually want to be off the drugs, but it's hard you know.\n\nI was so surprised she recommended to keep me on the narcotic, 30mgs of oxycodone. She said if I do it that way I'll most likely eliminate problems with breaking through the suboxone on my receptors for the pain problems. \n\nThen when I have pain flares if I could use an at home script I'd be able to stay out of the hospital and have 24\/7 pain relief instead of this yo-yo*ing* effect and nightly withdrawals I've been dealing with. \n\nThe specialist seemed to think staying on the microgram dosing wouldn't block the opiate the way it does in 2mg+ doses. It'd be like a 20mcg dose so it'd be easier\/simplier to breakthrough the pain \n\nShe alaso said later on down the line once I get stability I could switch to just the patch alone and then from there potentially come off of the patch entirely.\n\n***I'm really happy about this.***\n\nUnfortunately, my parents aren't on board and accused me of lying to the doctor about things, when I was brutally honest. I don't think I've ever been this honest with doctors before and this was her professional opinion. \n\nI'm upset with my family they keep calling me a street junkie and belittle me over my use of drugs in the first place and they say a lot of deeming things, but it's rough because I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm  just trying to do the right thing for my pain and it just seems like my parents are unsupportive and it's really upsetting me quite a bit.\n\nSupport would be warmly welcomed! Here's to hoping things go well and I do better now.","268":"So, I may be starting Butrans patches. I have my worries, but I think I'm going to do it regardless and give getting stability back in my life a try. So, with that, I've started to think about potentially doing the last high. \n\nI feel like if I do abuse my pain medication for that final high I'll be setting myself up to fail. Or somehow aren't truly ready to make the swap off the pills.\n\nAlternatively, if I don't abuse it then I'm setting myself up for success.\n\nOR perhaps it'd be better to have that final high and get it out of my system so I'm not thinking about it during the butrans patch period of time. However, I think I'll always romanticize the quick fast-acting narcotic pain relief that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside while conquering pain problems ... seriously, when I drop from an 8 of pain on the pain scale to a 3 it is better than a fucking orgasm.\n\nI dunno. Feel free to chime into the conversation.","269":"Today I had my appointment at the specialist's clinic that was a day's drive away from me. I got a second opinion on my pain issues. \n\nAfter spending 8am - 2pm there I walked away from it knowing that I definitely have serious pain issues and that the opiates are putting me into a vicious cycle of pain, withdrawal, and feeling \"okayish\" \n\nI am on 30-45mgs of oxycodone per day right now. \n\nIt doesn't make sense to up the dosage, it doesn't make sense to be on this for life and it doesn't make sense to keep going through the ups &amp; downs of withdrawal. Especially because I'm currently experiencing withdrawals *nightly* around 3 in the morning. I can't handle to constant yo-yo*ing* of my medical problems and upset with hospital visits etc.\n\nThe next step in all of this is that I'm going to see an addictionologist. \n\nThen I will go on suboxone patches (butrans patch) for pain purposes at a low dose. It'll all be done, inpatient. Mainly because I had a problem with suboxone film strips that you take orally. I had a seizure on that. \n\nIf it's successful and I can tolerate the butrans patch (goes on skin) then I can handle the pain better and pick up my life and once I gain stability on the patch, I can begin to get off these narcotic type medications entirely. \n\nIt scares me though because my pain problems are severe. I just don't know anymore. I'm really on the fence about this decision. \n\nThis isn't some Malibu recovery center that charges you $50,000 upfront since insurance won't cover it either, it's a hospital program that my insurance will cover and that has a real shot at weening me down and directing me correctly. \n\nThe fact that it's a hospitalized medical thing makes me feel a bit more comfortable, but I am completely unsure of everything. I may want to stay with what I know and what is predictable which is creating a lot of turmoil in my life or I can go, get serious, take this route and hope for the best.\n","270":"How is everyone? Like seriously, I wanna know. I've been very MIA and I miss you all.\n\nPersonally,\n\nI'm on the countdown to my 2nd opinion appointment. For the first time in a few years, I'll be getting another opinion on what to do about the situation I am in. \n\nFor those that don't know, I have a rare pancreatic condition. For the past 8.5 months, I've averaged a 5day hospital on a monthly basis for 7 months. \n\nWe're currently almost on month 2 without a hospital visit and that's a big fucking deal. I think part of it is that I've started giving a shit again and am just coping better :-). Don't get me wrong it's hard as fuck &amp; suicide has been on the brain a bit more realistically lately, but, hell if I'm gonna kill myself I might as well at least try first so, I've been doing that. Somehow the logic is twisted but it's working for me.\n\nJeepers. I'm rambling now, but ya. HI. How are you doing?","271":"I'm so embarrassed. \n\nLife is supposed to be good. Everything is supposed to be better. I'm supposed to be doing better, I **am** doing better. \n\nYet, I just want to die. I have a passive death wish. Clean, high, pain, pain-free I don't give a fuck. \n\nI've been in withdrawals for 2 ish days now. \n\nThe works, vomiting, runny tummy, hot\/cold flashes pain that makes sticking a hot poker into my eye sound like a *good* idea and my mother is running around the house going, \"look she's so high she's made herself sick! She's shitting herself and can't stop vomiting, why did you take so many drugs!?\" \n\n&amp; I'm here trying to explain withdrawals to no avail.\n\n\nI just need to be dead.","272":"2 days ago (October 29th) I had my golden Birthday. That's when you turn the age of the day of your birthday. For those that don't know this. For me that meant I was 29 on October 29th. \n\nI could not have been more miserable and angry with myself for being miserable about it.\n\nMy new man had booked us a cabin the woods as a birthday gift to me. We have only been together a month. ANyway, in an effort to NOT be dope sick on my birthday or in the cabin, I went through withdrawals a week and a half ago. \n\nI had it counted perfectly.gave mom enough pills to last me for my trip and told her no to give them to me till X day. I stuck to it and was really proud of myself for sticking to it. \n\nSo we get to the cabin and I'm counting out what I have when my brain decides that October 29th doesn't to exist. So I count out for October 27th, 28th, &amp; 30th. I was supposed to be out in the early morning on the 30th since that was the day we were headed home into town. \n\nSo, I wake p on the 29th (my birthday) go to take my morning dose and realize my horrible, horrible, horrible mistake. \n\n#Happy fucking birthday to me.\n\nTo top things off I also had a cold somehow and came to the \"sad\" realization that I'm almost 30 in a body that could easily be at least twice my age. I felt so bad for my man too, because I was really sour. He took it in strides like a champ though and did a few things to help me feel better, bath, sex, walks, food, comfort meds from CVS, that sorta thing. \n\nWe even debated going to the hospital but I insisted on not doing that because I know how useless they are. Even though I was having a bit of projectile vomiting (so I'm not all convinced it was purely withdrawals) I did eat quite a bit of junk food out there so that my have been contributing.\n\nI made the best of it all though. At least as best as I could and then when we got home on the 30th my hematologist was gracious enough to squeeze me into an appointment so I could get a set of IV pain meds, IV nausea meds, IV stomach meds, and IV fluids. I should be square for the next 12-24hrs now. \n\nAnyway, ya, I wasn't expecting that at all. I hope everyone is having a happier Halloween than I did birthday.","273":"As many of you may know, I have survived some extreme tragedies. Including the loss of my younger brother. Every year for the last 5 years I've made a post here about him on both his birthday and his passing. \n\n\n#Today is his birthday. He'd be 27 today. He died when he was 20 of a heroin overdose. If his story can help just one person think twice about his or her addiction then, his death wasn't in vain.\n\n\nMost importantly, I think his death has saved my life. I rather go through withdrawals than cross the bridge to heroin. A few days ago this was put to the test and I opted for withdrawals. \n\n\nApparently two years ago I set up an auto-email for myself for today. Not because I thought I'd forget today, but because I needed to remind myself that it's all OKAY. I got the year wrong in this auto email. It was supposed to send last year, but it sent this year. I was really surprised to get it today. Here is what it read:\n\n&gt;Dear FutureMe,\n\n&gt;Right now its the middle of June. In 4 months you will be celebrating [BROTHER]'s 26th birthday. Even though he's not around anymore remember the good times and don't forget to take care of yourself because you are loved.\n\n&gt;Xo,\n\n&gt;You.\n\n\nIt's his 27th birthday today, not 26th and I still miss him immensely. Today is a very complicated day for me. I'm not sure how to feel today. Roughly 3 weeks ago I started seeing someone new. Today is my new boyfriend's birthday. I don't know to feel about it exactly. Today is weird. \n\nAnyway, I love you all thanks for being there for me!","274":"I measure my months by my refill dates...\n\n...So far this is the first month in 7 months that I haven't had a 3+ day hospital stay. I'm really proud of myself for that. It's also the first month in 3 months I haven't required an early refill. I successfully tapered from 80mgs to 15mgs per day in ONE month. However, when I get my refill later this week I will jump back to 30mgs per day. I think that's sustainable now. I'm planning on asking my doctor for ninety 10mg oxys and then only take 20mgs per day and build a reserve stash for those days when the pay is outstanding\/horrid. \n\nAlso, in the last two weeks I've started seeing someone new. My life is finally picking up and I'm getting a little healthier. Oh and that pain clinic I've been wanting to get into? Yah, I got in, I go next month for a full day evaluation and am going to get a second opinion on my issues and how to manage my severe pancreatic pain problems.\n\nI seriously am looking forward to it.\n\nThen better than that in the last two weeks I started seeing someone new. We met on OkCupid which, I had joined as a *joke.* So, I was super suprised to like this guy as much as I do.\n\nHe's a cancer survivor so my new guy gets and understands the medical side of things. He's not on any opiates either and although we haven't been intimate, I've started referring to him as my boyfriend and likewise I'm his \"girlfriend.\" \n\nYou know how you meet that SO and you just \"know\" it's the one? Yah, that's how I feel. I've never felt that before. This is so new to me, I'm doing everything in my power not to fuck this up. \n\nI cannot believe what a helluva month it's been.","275":"Love, there isn\u2019t a day I don\u2019t think about you.

Anyone wanna chitchat? Xo.","277":"Heya Fam!\n\nAs you may know I've run into some turbulent times. My parents are wanting me to go to rehab, and my doctor is urging me to get my use under control because he will no longer write anymore early refills for me. I've required one for the past two months and he's basically told me to suck it up and stick to what he scripts me. Which, I have no problem with. As a result I have been on a taper and am finally comfy at 37.5mgs of oxycodone. I will however need to bring that down to 30mgs in the next 5 days. I think it's very realistic and doable.\n\nWhile all of this has been going on we've been looking into everything from rehabs, dual diagnosis centers to pain clinics. The rehabs and dual diagnosis places denied me based on the severity of my medical condition. Those places felt they would not be able to help me. It was both devastating and relieving to hear that. \n\nAnyway, there was this one program that took me two months to hear back from, and lots of paperwork had to be sent it. I got a call the other day that they're gonna take on my case! I'm SO EXCITED. It's not a detox or a rehab at all. It's a pain clinic that's 8hrs away from me. \n\nMy appointment is in 2moths from now. They're doing a full day evaluation session. I arrive at 8am to coordinate paperwork and get information together with the receptionist. Then at 8:30 I meet with the Pain Specialist\/Doctor for 75 minutes. They do a full intake and evaluation of my situation. That is followed up b 75 minutes of physical therapy consult and session and finallly ends with a 90 minute session with the pain psychologist. \n\nAfter that I go to lunch for an hour and come back to meet with the entire team for 30-45minutes to discuss what they think and any recommendations they may have for me regarding my situation. \n\nMy trip is going to be open ended because they could have me stay for their inpatient program where they adjust medications, monitor your mental health, and stabilize you if you need it. It's all personalized for me specially and I'm so excited that they think they can help me after reviewing my medical records.\n\nI plan to be as honest as possible too. For instance, I will admit to overtaking my script and that I have a tendency to abuse my medications to avoid going to the emergency room when I probably should just go to the emergency room. I probably wont mention snorting my medication but like I said I'll talk about how I've been doubling it up and just struggling. I also plan to be honest about my diet and what I've found works for my GI System and what does not work for it. \n\nSo yah. They already told me they wont write me any narcotic scripts the first visit, which I'm 100% okay with since I can't accept it anyway because of my local pain specialist. \n\nAnywhoozles, I'm excited about it and had to share!","278":"Guys, if my habit is 50-60mgs of oxy per day and I'm withdrawing at a rate decreas of 5mgs every 3 days how much lope should I be taking to ease things? I'm noticing I'm feeling achy all day long and am spending about 6 hours in a 24hr period in mild withdrawals, achy bones, achy muscles, hot\/cold, sweating etc. It's coming at the 4-6 hr mark of each dose I take and stuff plus, I'm in regular pain too so I'm feeling icky. I'm thinking lope can help but IDK what or how much to take of it. Please advise.","279":"Firstly, I've been in the hospital for 5 days. I don't know when this item went missing but I sure as fuck haven't been home. I'm being accused of stealing something. I don't even know what I'm accused of stealing, mom is on a war path looking for \"something,\" It's a big enough deal that she canceled her evening activities because of it. She never cancels! I'm freaking the fuck out now because I'm getting yelled at for something I didn't do simply because I \"do drugs.\" I'll be the first person to admit I have a drug problem but never have I ever stolen from my parents or anyone else. I'm flipping the fuck out right now and its causing me so much anxiety. My relationship with my parents is quickly deteriorating. I don't know what to do. I feel like a loser even though I 1,000% didn't take whatever the fuck it is that's so important she's turning the house upside down looking for. Including my room. My entire room has been ransacked. FML. The worst thing I did tonight was order takeout. I fucking didn't steal anything!!! \n\nRant over.\n\nEDIT: I texted my dad that this time I would let him kill my dog if I was found lying because I'm not fucking lying. At all. She'll find it, I'm sure of it, but until then I get to be the bad guy. Ugh.","280":"So just a little backstory for the uninformed on my story. My parents caught me snorting my Opana medication, and also discovered I was 15 days early out of a refill. We decided to go cold turkey on it and only take 2.5mg doses of the Opana to get me to the next week so I could see my doctor. \n\nWell, I never got through the labor day weekend. I ended up in the hospital on Sunday and have been there ever since. I'm here now. Should be going home tomorrow and my doctor graciously has decided to renew my script. \n\nHe is however taking me off the Opana, he doesn't know I was snorting it, my parents didn't snitch, but I made it clear he can't prescribe that to me anymore that it was causing problems with withdrawal.\n\nAlso, in an effort to decrease the overall dosage when you do the equivalents of standard oral Opana to Oxycodone (2:1) I'm taking a 10mg decrease per day hit. So I'll be getting 30mgs of Oxycodone per 24hr period. \n\nWe spent this whole hospital stay getting my medications resorted and putting me on bowel rest &amp; letting antibiotics do their magic. As it turns out I had an active mild type of sepsis and my liver functions\/pancreatic enzymes were high. \n\nWhich, although isn't good, made me feel better about my usage because it shows something was really wrong and instead of just swallowing my pills I should've gone to the hospital to begin with.\n\nGoing forward, I plan to make it a damned mission to not get an early refill. My doctor has made it clear he's going to let me drown if I do this again. Although, it's a bit more understood because of the sepsis &amp; elevated functions. Hence, the break my doctor is giving me, but the lesson there is if I'm in more pain no matter how much I hate the hospital - I need to go to the hospital. \n\nAlso, while my parents did not tattle on me to my regular doctors they did tell my shrink so, I get to go into his office sometime next week with my tail between my legs and apologize for the bad behavior because, he's definitely irritated with me. \n\nI kinda feel like a failed case\/patient. I've been in therapy since I was 16 with him and arguably I've gotten worse in the last 12 years. He's great though, he cares and I sometimes think of him as a grandfather type figure. I really need to keep up my regular appointments with him.\n\nOther than that, I'm recovering. We're also getting a second opinion from an specific inpatient pain program that's about 8 hrs away. Just got the call that their doctors are reviewing my case and will be in touch. They have an inpatient hospital program where they evaluate the medications that would work best for you. They have you talk to shrinks and do group work etc. to find ways to manage your pain in between medication doses along with making sure you're on the right dosages. It is NOT a detox. So, I'm hoping to get into that program. It would be a lifesaver if I do.\n\nEnd of story. Thanks for the harsh words, compassion, love, and for keeping it real.","281":"UPDATE HERE: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/6xfofl\/rehab_said_no_no_no\/\n\nSo, dad caught me snorting my meds, well rather he found the straw I used which led to a confession of snorting my medication. I've been so good with sticking to my script, I actually haven't snorted in a long time, but that's apparently irrelevant. \n\nWe called my physicatirst who recommended an inpatient rehab facility. We called around a bunch of places and we found one that says they're not going to rip me off all my medications. Rather they're going to work with me to find the dosage and medication that fits best.\n\nFrom there they'll probably encourage me to get sober, but we'll see. I have a lot of very real medical problems and leaving me without pain control just seems cruel. So if I'm MIA I'm in a rehab\/hospital facility figuring my life out.\n\nI say goodbye to my dog and everything I know to make a change in my life that I'm not sure will actually help.

My itch still wasn't scratched though so I called up my connect for blues and got some extras for $450 total. \n\nThen, I have a friend who I played Junkie Jesus for. She's been in a bad spot so I kicked her 3 of my blues, $20 for gas and \"loaned\" her $80 because she was stuck owing her guy $80. She's like my only friend I know that uses. So, I didn't mind helping her out and chances are I would've gambled that $80 again and lost it so instead of giving it to the casino - she gets it.\n\nAfter that I went to clinic today an they gave me IV dilaudid and now I'm home just chilling and feeling pretty good without injecting anything I'm not supposed to. Clinic is a doctors office I go to in lieu of the ER. It's really helpful.\n\nThis weekend I might go to a concert and\/or Disneyland so I should have plenty of things to occupy my mind.

I am now due for a follow up CT to see if that 5mm mass has grown any. If it has grown, I likely have lung cancer. I go for the CT on the 21st and see my doctor on the 24th. \n\nI was getting really anxious about this possibility and decided to use Dr. Google to see if my fears were justified. Here is what I found it was about Cushing's Syndrome:\n\n&gt;weight gain, easy bruising, weakness, drowsiness, and fluid retention. Cushing syndrome can also cause high blood pressure and high blood sugar levels (or even diabetes).\n\nAccording to the [American Cancer Society](https:\/\/www.cancer.org\/cancer\/lung-cancer\/prevention-and-early-detection\/signs-and-symptoms.html) Cushings is a parananeoplastic syndrome associate with lung cancer. These problems are called paraneoplastic syndromes. Sometimes these syndromes can be the first symptoms of lung cancer. \n\nThat's just great because:\n\n1. Weight Gain: Gained 50lbs in the last year\n2. Easy Bruising: I bruise everytime an IV is inserted even when done correctly. I also have a few random bruises that I don't know where they came from.\n3. Weakness: Just in general I would say I'm pretty weak\n4. Drowsiness: For the past two weeks I've been sleeping for 3+ hours at a time on a daily basis after getting a full night's sleep.\n5. High blood pressure: Every doctors visit and time I check it its been abnormally high for a few months.\n6. High Blood Sugar: Apparently for the last 3 visits over the last 5 months to my doctors office my blood sugar has been really high.\n\nThose are just symptoms of cushing's syndrome but I have almost all of them. As for general symptoms of lung cancer, I've been coughing and sneezing blood for a week and a half plus I've been breathing really heavily to the point where friends\/family are commenting on it. \n\nI also am at huge risk because I've been sick with chronic pancreatitis for a very long time and have probably received more radiation than I should have over the last few years. My grandmother passed away from lung cancer too, granted she was an EX smoker and had been smoke free for 20 years when she got the cancer. So, I think that puts me at risk too. Luckily, I am not a smoker so I've got that going for me at least.\n\n-----------\n\nI think I'm right to be a little more spooked than the average bear.

I wouldn't choose it, I would never say \"I want to die\" and I'll be pissed if I am but at the same time there's this sense like \"well I guess this is for the best - saving me from more agony that life generally causes\"\n\nI hope that makes sense.

I posted it for *fun* but it does bring to light a very serious conversation to be had.\n\nI was surprised by the number of people who were saying calling addiction a disease is a bad thing, a crutch if you. But what if I told you calling it a disease and using it as a crutch can be a positive\/good thing? What if I told you it could lead to recovery? \n\nI personally believe that addiction is a disease and that by denying that a person is only perpetuating myths and stigmas regarding addiction and dependence.\n\nI have a few diagnosis\/diseases:\n\n* Gastroparesis\n* Chronic Pancreatitis\n* Addiction\/Opioid Dependence\n* Schizoaffective Disorder\n\nI would be very comfortable telling people that I was battling those four diseases, but everyone looks at it differently.\n\nI understand that it isn't a traditional disease,^[1](http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/02791072.1993.10472271) but would you say mental illness isn't a sickness of sorts too? What would you call it? A choice? If it was a choice addicts wouldn't exist because they would be able to quit anytime.^[2](http:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/278\/5335\/45) Addiction is a disease of disease of compulsion and drive. It involves the Orbitofrontal Cortex.^[3](http:\/\/cercor.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/10\/3\/318.short)\n\nI believe that playing the sick role^[4](http:\/\/davidscottsociology.tripod.com\/sitebuildercontent\/sitebuilderfiles\/illnessbehaviorandthesickrole.pdf) gets you nowhere and I think that is where people get upset with labeling addiction as a disease because people use it as a crutch. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.^[5](https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/blog\/ambigamy\/201404\/psychological-crutches-ten-myths-and-three-tips) \n\nHOWEVER Using in the following forms isn't a great idea (in my opinion):\n\n* *I can't help it! I'm sick, I'm gonna do more dope because of it!*\n\n* *I only do this dope because I have an illness!!!*\n\n* *I'm dopesick and need my drugs to get better! This illness is killing me*\n\nThese are examples of using it as a crutch in a negative manner. However, labeling it as a disease and using it to enable yourself to become better is a different story. Once you know you are dealing with a drug addiction disease it can lead to better ways to treat the sickness and can enable people to get better.^[5](http:\/\/www.asam.org\/public-resources\/treatment)\n\nJust my thoughts on it.

Oh well, hopefully, it works in my favor now that I'm headed home. \n\nI visited the ER 2 times during my 20-day stay once because my neck surgery was SO painful in the cold there, more so than normal, and my neurosurgeon sent me based on my symptoms. They prescribed Klonopin to help me sleep\/deal with the anxiety I was facing and apparently it works as a muscle relaxer too.\n\nThen, the 2nd time I was vomiting for 3 days before I went in again.

At least I'm not vomiting anymore. Pain has just been bad, between the spine surgery and pancreatic issues I've been in so much pain.\n\nTraveling today has been an absolute disaster.

It was the end of fall term. \n\n&gt;I spent a few hours on campus, dropped off the final and skipped out on class. I remember being confronted by the teacher\u2019s assistant, \u201cWhy are you leaving early?\u201d  he barked at my friend and I as we attempted to leave the 300-student lecture hall. I responded with, \u201cI\u2019ve got a class to drop and family business to take care of. I\u2019ve attended every lecture and I need to go.\u201d He couldn\u2019t keep me there and I left. He seemed puzzled by my commitment to family, that family was more important to me than school. I remember him protesting to me, **lecturing me that family, places to be, and things to do would always be there. That I should seize hold of my education and opportunity ahead of me.**\n\n&gt;At that moment I agreed with him, and to be honest, I was just being a terrible student in that moment. It was the end of the term, I was having a good day and I didn\u2019t feel like sitting through the professor\u2019s last lecture.\n\n&gt;As I got into my apartment hallway on my way home I noticed my phone had a voicemail. I remember listening to it in the elevator, on my way to the first floor. Short and sweet it struck fear into my heart:\n \n&gt;\u201cHey Dori, it is Daddy. Call me\u2014we need to talk.\u201d\n\n&gt; I called him back right away from the hallway on the house line. The phone rang once, and he answered. We talked, and he said that him and mom were coming right over, that there was something to discuss\u2014we needed to have a family meeting right away, and they would be at my apartment. \n\n&gt;Right away it was strange; we had just had a huge meeting about finances that weekend. Why would we need to meet again? Now? What for? I flew into a mode of panic. The apartment was a mess. I had twenty girls over the night before and didn\u2019t get a chance to really clean up that morning. Quickly I started cleaning the apartment like I never had before. I\u2019m not one to keep things disorganized but I\u2019m not one to clean either, especially for my parents. The behavior was anxiety induced and at first it worked as a great distraction: \u201cJust get the apartment cleaned\u2014think about things later.\u201d  I don\u2019t know why I felt this way. Perhaps it was something in my father's tone that gave him away or a sixth sense of sorts that I had. that afternoon. I acted out of pure fear and It took 20 minutes to get the kitchen, bedroom area, and living area fully organized and done. Even had time to get the laundry sorted and clean clothes on hangers. My parents should have been arriving at any minute.\n\n&gt;Yet they weren\u2019t there. Another five long minutes passed and I racked my brain, \u201cThis isn\u2019t good,\u201d I thought to myself, as I peeked out the front window to look for them pulling up. They weren\u2019t there, and I paced.\n\u201cWell, think!\u201d I remember telling myself harshly. I remember analyzing it. \u201cDad called me, not mom. He said Daddy. Something\u2019s wrong, his tone was off. My great grandmother, she\u2019s 93 perhaps something horrible has happened to her? But that\u2019s on Mom\u2019s side, why wouldn\u2019t mom call me about that?\u201d I wondered, \u201cWell, wait, the dog\u2019s been sick. We know we have to put him down soon. Maybe he needs to be put down. Maybe the vet called.\u201d\n        \t\n&gt;\u201cMy brother is going to freak out. I wonder if he\u2019s coming with mom and dad. They should be in the car by now. It\u2019s been thirty minutes, they should\u2019ve been here by now. They don\u2019t live that far away. Maybe I should call the house and see if my brother answers, they\u2019re probably in the car alone without him and he\u2019s at home and already knows.\u201d\n\n&gt;It was at that moment I was paralyzed with fear. I went to dial the house number but could not. I did not want to confirm the next thought I had. \u201cWhat if my brother doesn\u2019t answer? What if something\u2019s happened to him?\u201d\nAnd then it struck me, ten minutes before my parents arrived. Ten minutes before I knew anything had happened, I feared the worst. \u201cWhat if my brother got into trouble\u2014what if he\u2019s dead?\u201d And like a mantra I repeated over and over again, out loud, \u201cPlease let it be the dog. Please let it be the dog. Don\u2019t let it be him, not him.\u201d\n\n&gt;Ten minutes of this sorta prayer went on, and I saw my parents pull up through the upstairs window. Before I knew it they were at my door, and as I opened the door before they could even fully ring the bell because I was right on the other end, waiting, I saw my mother\u2019s face, a picture of distress and anguish, an expression that is the definition of pure anguish, and without words I reached out to hug her, knowing something was horribly amiss. But before I could dive in for that hug, dad touched my shoulder and simply said, \u201cYour brother is dead.\u201d I crumpled to the ground in what was a collapse in tears of incomprehensible grief.\n\nJust in case anyone is wondering, he died of a heroin overdose.

Surgery is an option but it's an absolute life or death last resort kinda thing. They do not want to do it if they can avoid it.\n\nFor me, this is both bittersweet. On one hand, my doctor is going to call my pain specialist and explain\/request that I be on a higher dosage of pain medication. On the other hand, it's devastating to be in so much pain. I haven't even been getting high from my medication just barely out of pain.  I do feel relieved that all my pain medication needs and extra buys haven't been because I'm just fine, because I'm obviously not. \n\nFor me, getting high is probably equivalent of any other persons normal.

Have a Spooktacular Halloween &lt;3.","322":"Except, I forgot to post this past October 24th, 2016 when my brother would have been 26 this year. He died six years ago of a heroin overdose. Alone in his room. For the past 2 years, I've posted about his death on his birthday. ([Here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/3q2f7k\/an_anecdote_from_the_day_my_brother_died\/) &amp; [Here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/2k5ri0\/in_about_an_hour_and_a_half_we_always_counted_our\/)) \n\nI feel ***awful*** not only because I forgot to post on his Birthday, but I forgot it was even his Birthday. I woke up that morning with shooting pains down my left arm, tingling and a lot of numbness in my fingers. It was a lot like my issues before my spinal neck surgery. \n\nSo, for the entire day, I was in incredible pain and ended up going to the ER late that night. My mom came by the ER around 11pm to sit with me, something she rarely does, and it was then that she realized I forgot the birthday. \n\nWhile I feel awful about forgetting his birthday, I can't help but feel relieved too, like maybe I'm somehow moving on and not stuck in the past missing him. \n\nFor the past 6 years there hadn't been a day I didn't think about my brother until recently when I started to think about him every few days instead of every day.\n\nAnyway, I still wanted to post about him and share, because I think it serves a purpose. Losing him has been the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with. Cherish every moment you have with your loved ones, even if they drive you nuts, there is a reason you love them. Remember and think about that!","323":"Today, I met up with a connect and left my cell phone in his car! I just about flipped a lid because I use Uber and Lyft to get around and was 100% out of cash with the exception of $8 and over 15miles away from my home. It would be really hard to explain to my family how the fuck I ended up out there without my phone or money... \n\nSo...\n\nI tried calling my phone from a strangers phone but that didn't work. I usually have my phone on silent so I expect that's what's happening to me now.\n\nBy the grace of Junkie Jesus I had my laptop on me... So, I whip it out and there happens to be free wifi at my location. THANK JUNKIE JESUS. I text my connect from a web application I use for anything drug related and he comes back to give it back to me! I was so fucking relieved. \n\nIt's my worst nightmare being stuck out in the middle of an unfamiliar area without my cell phone and no money whatsoever. I ended up giving my guy the rest of the cash on me which was just that $8 but, I felt it was only right to \"tip\" him for bringing it back. \n\nI need to get over my nerves when doing deals, I just get shaky, jumpy, nervous, and forgetful which leads to bad shit happening. Hopefully, this is a lesson learned and I can calm the fuck down in the future and NEVER leave my cell behind again.","324":"Hot damn man! I am so excited about getting P-A-I-D tomorrow! It's my 2nd check from this new job and it comes in tomorrow. Right now my boss is being chill and paying me weekly, because I've been super short on cash and he knows it. I'm happy because I'll be able to get rid of my death note (Samsung Galaxy Note 7) and pay I few people I owe cash to (regular loans not drug fronts). Plus, I might even have enough for a few extra meds, we'll see though. \n\nIf not I plan to stash $75-$100 of my money to be able to get a big haul next week or in 2 weeks from now depending on what my doctor scripts me Monday. Which is another thing I'm nervous about for a few reasons. \n\nMy pain doctor used to script me 5mg IR Opana's so I'm going to see if he doesn't mind adding those back into my regime. I had a 10-day hospital stay this month that could've been avoided had I had decent breakthrough pain medication. Although who knows, I did have GI Bleeding too, but after the GI scope my specialist said it was nothing to worry about at all and will heal up on its own! So that is good!\n\nI'm in such a predicament because pain medication actually makes my condition worse in the long run, but leaving my condition alone, I'm non-functional. It just means I can't miss a single dose of medication being an hour late on meds can throw my whole system for a loop. I feel like I'm constantly chasing the pain and wish there was a better option, but such is life.\n\nShitpost because I can!","325":"Ahhhh good things all around. First of all, I got my first paycheck for my new job this past Friday which was super exciting. \n\nUnfortunately, going into work has been difficult this first week. I'm very fatigued but worst of all I'm short on my oxycodone. I'm prescribed and usually take 20mgs in a day but, have had to cut down to 15mgs to get to my next pain doctor appointment because  I had a lot of breakthrough pain this month and required extras. \n\nAnyway, at 15mgs (5mg 3x\/daily) I've been going into withdrawals on a nightly basis. Around 2 or 3am I've woken up consistently in a cold sweat, with my nose running and all the bells and whistles of withdrawal and pain. \n\nFor the past week I've been taking my last 5mgs at 6pm going to bed at 10pm waking at 2am in withdrawals, getting back to bed at 5am and then waking at 9am to take my medication to be out of withdrawals.\n\nI don't think it's mental because I'm waking in a cold sweat vs. being awake and talking myself into it. Anyway, this is a good story so, today I was at my cousin's place and we were talking when suddenly she asks me about my pain and what I go through. I explained my nightly predicament at the moment too.\n\nWell, she broke her arm last month and she was prescribed \"too many\" painkillers. So, she asked if I needed any extras. I got ten 5\/325 Percocet from her and now I can say goodbye to restless sleep. I'm so fucking happy right now. \n\nThank Goodnes Grief God! :-) Nothing like not withdrawing.","326":"HI!\n\nGot into work today for the first time in forever. It's kinda awesome. It's exactly what I want to be doing with website development and advertising.

I'm a contractor employee which is exactly where I need to be and from what I can tell with growth there's a potential to be making six figures doing this.\n\nPlus, I love the office location. My bank is right there and so is a grocery store and a ton of restaurants. Hahahahaa.\n\nAnyway, shitpost, just wanted to share.\n\n&amp; puppy can come to work with me which I honestly think is the best bit.","327":"I got his toy bear to squeak and he went ballistic! Growling, running, yipping, chasing, pouncing, jumping 9 pound ball of excitement and now his toy just fell off his bed. He's giving me his, \"WTF, well aren't you gonna get that for me?\" face now. LoL ...\n\nBe back in a bit gotta go get dog toy off the floor!\n\nShitpost hope you guys enjoy it though!","328":"So, I get super itchy from IV narcotics and the pain team here at the hospital INSISTED that having me on a Narcan drip at ~~12mgs~~ 0.50mgs per hour (12mgs in 24hrs) would not affect my pain meds and would keep the itching at bay.\n\nI've been in a significant amount of pain throughout this hospital stay for the last 8 days. Plus, I've been itchy regardless of the narcan drip.\n\nFinally, today, after they did the colonoscopy and found I have ulcers throughout my colon (yay \/s) did I wake up in pain and the surgery unit gave me IV push pain meds that didn't do jack shit. \n\nI made the decision then and there to refuse the Narcan drip. I got after the pain team for having me on that and no wonder I was in so much pain, etc. they now have me off the Narcan drip and on the Benadryl.\n\nIt's so fucked up because when I first came in they insinuated I like the way Benadryl feels and that Benadryl is addicting in and of itself and I told them about the itching and that is how this whole mess started. \n\nHow fucked are things if doctors are now hesitant to give BENADRYL with an IV Piggyback of 0.5mgs of Dilaudid!?!!?!? What sense does that make! NONE! \n\nLuckily today the pain has been better and everything is okay, I should go home tomorrow but holy fuck did these guys screw me for this stay. I should've refused from day 1 but I was trying my best to be cooperative and practice trusting the professionals. \n\n**It's so sad because TIL I can't trust them. ;-(.**","329":"I was supposed to go over to my potential new place of employment tomorrow but, I fell ill with some GI Bleeding. I'm currently hospitalized and preparing for a colonoscopy. Hopefully, it's an easy thing to fix and doesn't interfere with my new job.\n\nLucky for me the boss knows me outside of a working environment and was understanding. I'm really hoping this new job helps keep me busy and less health things go wrong.\n\nI've slowly been getting better, though. I had the spinal neck surgery in May, the feeding tube was removed in June, and now I'm just starting to get over it all. \n\nSo cheers to a new future!","330":"Not just any job either. A job with a ton of perks. First, the pay is AMAZING. $60k base pay PLUS any comission I may bring in. It's not a sales job either its doing SEO\/Internet Marketing for a small business. They have a GREAT office AND the guy I'm working with said he'd have no problem with me bringing my dog to work! Holy hell fire balls. eeeee. \n\nEDIT: Now all that needs to happen is getting out of the hospital. I've got some GI Bleeding going on so hopefully it clears up. This company is also aware of my health issues and is willing to work with me when I get sick. I couldn't ask for better.","331":"[My Original Post 1 Year Ago]( https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/3mzb7s\/i_dont_know_her_username_but_she_participated_in\/)\n\nMy parents used to protect me from her. The last time we talked I was 13 and she was 16. We had thanksgiving dinner together. Then, 2 years ago we reconnected after being estranged for over a decade. \n\nMy parents limited my communication with her through my teenage and young adulthood years because they wanted to protect me from her Heroin addiction. \n\nWhen we reconnected as women in our mid-late 20s it was like I found my sibling again. My brother had died 4 years prior and her brother who I never knew had died 2 years prior to us reconnecting. Mine had died from a heroin addiction and her brother died of a diabetes complication.\n\nI knew she was headed down the path of relapse and I HATE myself for not speaking up about it. But, then again on September 24th, 2015 when she died we had only been talking again for 8 months. It wasn\u2019t my place to intervene and apparently others close to her had confronted her about it days before she died.\n\nI feel for her mother who now has lost both her adult children. No parent should ever feel that pain.\n\nI miss my cousin so much. Do me a favor guys, and practice harm reduction. In her memory.","332":"My heart races, my bones ache, I try to move around, shift my position, nope. It still hurts. I can feel everything. I wonder carefully, when will it end? When will it stop? When will I feel okay again? When I take my next dose? No, that would be too easy. I may not be in withdrawals, but I am in severe pain. I wish to hell it was better, but it's not. I'm terribly lost.","333":"So, since being caught red-handed with extra medication that wasn't a part of my script things at home have been decent enough. Despite being 27 my parents have asked me to stay home for the next few days and get some of my things in order.\n\nYesterday, that consisted of speaking for quite some time with my dad about what was happening to me with the pain and the subsequent addiction. We also spoke about my father's past and he opened up with things that I cannot share on a public forum, but I came to the realization that my dad knows a lot more about addiction problems than I thought.\n\nHe also knows I'm going to be a challenge to treat due to the fact that he knows not only am I brilliant (his words) but, I'm a clone copy of him in many ways (we have similar thinking patterns, behaviors, and nuances that match up) and that I am addicted to my medication as well as dependent on them for legitimate pain that he's witnessed over the last few years.\n\nSo, according to him rehab is:\n\n1. Probably Not Going to be Effective\n2. Not Worth its Price Tag\n\nSo, yesterday was my last day of being miserable.\n\nToday, I told my dad I was going to get my space organized, help mom do some laundry and kitchen things and just chill out. Well, he gets home and sees everything was followed up on and I didn't blow him off on the things he wanted me to do.\n\nSo, now I have a bouquet of multi-colored roses sitting on the table by the window. He told me they were for getting shit done and that he knows what I've been through and recognizes it isn't easy. He got them both as a reward and \"get better\" gesture. \n\nHonestly, it feels awkward to me, didn't he just catch me with drugs? What is this sorcery? Huh? But, something about it feels right, like he knows, more than I could ever know. \n\n&amp; that alone means the world.\n\n**TL;DR: Got caught with extra meds, rewarded with flowers 3 days later after a few deep discussions and following up on things that needed to be done around the house.**\n\nEDIT\n---\n\nJeepers! Thank you, for all the kind words and support from everyone. I was not expecting this to happen and I was not expecting such a huge response from the community. It doesn't surprise me too much that this is the way my dad is responding. After all, [he did toss in some cash to Tracey's fund once](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/3uowe1\/one_month_after_he_turned_20\/) to directly help out here. He doesn't know the URL or the name of this forum just that I knew someone who was preventing deaths. I wish I could respond to you all individually, but that is proving difficult, I might do it anyway over the next few days. Stay safe and amazing \/r\/opiates :-).","334":"Fuck me, fuck my life, just fuck.\n\nSo, I've been living at home following my break up with my boyfriend and my Dad found my stash of extra Oxycodone. Obviously, he freaked out, and he said he waited a day to confront me about it. He would like me to go through insurance covered rehab but, knows if I don't want it, it will never work. I agree with him. It won't work now, not while I have so much pain going on that is ill-managed. \n\nI'm not terrified of withdrawals, I'm terrified of PAIN. Not to mention, I don't have any desire to be clean, I just want to be *managed*.\n\nHe made an offer to basically enable me. Move me out of their house, to an apartment, where I'll be able to do what I \"want.\" I put want in quotations because I don't know what I want. All I want is to be out of pain. That's it.\n\nWhat the hell do I do? I feel icky.\n\nMy dad said I didn't have to make any decisions today, that I could wait and see in January, and just see. Amazingly enough, he gave me one of my \"meds\" to pull me out of withdrawals and if I need more, I just need to talk to him for every dose. \n\nI'm sick in so many ways and I'm so just blah.\n\nEdit: I've tried methadone. Worst withdrawals of my fucking life and I had a seizure on Suboxone so those two medications aren't really a viable option. I'm on 50mgs of Oxycodone in 24hrs to stay 100% pain-free &amp; not high. I am prescribed 20mgs\/day by a pain clinic. My doctor refuses to make any increases citing my age &amp; the potential for addiction, which I already have along with dependency.\n\nEdit Again: I also had a feeding tube for 3 years for my pancreatic condition and had spinal surgery this past May.\n","335":"Day two of Withdrawals to reset my tolerance and my god.

I let ride two know off the bat to not hold any shit for me if someone else comes along and I'd let them know if I no longer need them.\n\nSo after picking up from ride one successfully, I texted ride two and told them, \n\n&gt;\"hey, no longer am in need but, please keep me in mind when you reup next, I get into bad shape occasionally and its always nice to have options!\" \n\nThey responded telling me I what a waste of time I was. I was just like, Sorry? I told ya up front not to hold anything for me!\n\nAnd to make this person even shadier, they had tried to get me to WU them money and said they'd mail me my shit since it was so expensive to get out to them. Obvs. I refused to do that...\n\nBut, like WTF? Did I break some kind of code or is this connect just batshit or not legit?\n\nI saved them in my phone as \"batshit don't do business\" in case I ever run into their number again...I just don't understand why they'd be so pissed when I said not to hold in the first place?\n","338":"How is everyone feeling\/doing tonight?

I'm gonna have to face withdrawals and I'm scared. I'm scared I have no self control. I'm scared of the pain of this, I'm just scared.","341":"On April 12th I woke up with shooting pains in my left shoulder. A week later, I decided to get it looked at. On May 6th I went to the ER and they did an emergency MRI. Turns out I had a disc herniation in my neck. \n\nOn the 12th of May, the Neurosurgeon advised surgery to fix the issue within the next three months. On May 16th the pain became so incredible I went back to the emergency room where they admitted me. I had surgery on May 19th and was hospitalized for a total of 10 days 2 of which were spent in the ICU.\n\nMy boyfriend at the time showed up to the hospital maybe twice during that time. That among other things led to a breakup with him, and that was difficult because we lived together.\n\nNow I'm 27, completely disabled with a metal plate in my neck and just feeling cruddy overall, plus I've had to move home. I haven't lived at home since I was 19. It's driving me bonkers. I can barely shower on my own.\n\nNot to mention my doctor is furious with me. I'm on 20mg of oxycodone in a day (which is like nothing) and he wants me down to 15mg. However, I went through my script way fast. Luckily he renewed it early, but if I do that again, I'll be SOL. \n\nI was talking to my therapist who is also an addictions counselor and she said the rate of heroin overdoses has QUADRUPLED because of the restrictions the DEA is putting on doctors. \n\nSo people who would never normally need or want heroin are getting it and overdosing. She said even cancer patients are getting denied pain medication. It is a cruel and unusual world for sure.\n\nThe good news is the feeding tube got removed. THANK GOD. I feel better without it now. It did it's job and now I'm doing better in that department.\n\nFor the curious here is a few pictures that document my feeding tube removal and what they did to my neck:\n\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/8AlDx","342":"\/r\/Opiates Guide to Pooping\n-----\n\nI don't know why I felt the need to put so much time into this, but I did so enjoy it!\n\nWhether you\u2019re in withdrawals needing to take Lope or have a heavy habit and can\u2019t go I figured this run down on things would help.\n\nI have a terrible fucking gut due to my gastroparesis &amp; other gastrointestinal issues like pancreatitis. So, take my regime with a huge grain of salt. Unless you\u2019re on insane amounts of narcotics you could probably get away with using 1-2 things from my personal list:\n\n1. Cap of Miralax in my morning coffee\n2. 25mg dose of Movantik with my morning meds\n3. Tablets of Senna in the morning\n4. 1-2 Servings of refried beans throughout the day\n5. Glycerin Suppositories for moderate constipation\n6. Enemas for emergency situations \n\nNatural Helpers:\n-----\n\n**Prunes\/Prune Juice:*** Eating 3-5 Prunes are a day is an easy way to keep your gut moving. One cup of prune juice will work within 2-5hours. Be careful if you eat or drink too much of this, you will end up with problems.\n\n**Coffee:** Coffee is known to stimulate the bowels however, it is not recommended to have more than 2 or 3 cups because it is a diuretic and can cause dehydration.\n\n**Fiber:** Fiber comes in a ton of shapes and forms and will get your gut going.\n\n* Fruits are really great with raspberries providing 8 grams of fiber in a single serving\n* Whole Wheats are also good, think bran, oatmeal, whole wheat bread, and so forth\n* Nuts and Beans are really good especially black beans, almonds, and lentils\n* Vegetables like broccoli and artichoke are great. Think dark leafy greens here. Iceberg lettuce is worthless.\n\nOver the Counter Drugs:\n----\n\n**Miralax:** Miralax is great because it is gentle. You can take a maximum of two capfuls in a day. It is best when dissolved in something warm like your tea or coffee. It works by drawing water into your intestinal tract and in turn, this stimulates a bowel movement.\n\n**Senna**: It is a natural laxative that will work overnight or within 24hrs. It is gentle and has been known to be used for irritable bowel syndrome.\n\n**Colace** is a stool softer and does the same sort of thing Miralax does. Some people find Colace helps more than Miralax others do not. Everyone is different.\n\n\n**Ducalax:**This stimulates your intestines to work faster and ultimately produces a bowel movement in 4-6 hours at the most. It's a great quick way to relieve any kind of sever constipation. However, if you have IBS this might make you cramp and have problems. \n\n**Magnisum Citrate:** If you can stomach drinking it this will do the trick quick! It takes maybe 30 minutes and your gut is moving. Doctors sometimes ask patients to drink this after they finish the prep for a colonoscopy to ensure that everything is out.\n\n**Enemas:** If you feel it there, but can't get that final push through, use an enema. It's no worse than plugging and really does work. Be careful though, you can become dependent on enemas. Only use them every so often as a last resort. Do not use more than 1 a day otherwise you will get dehydrated and that causes problems..\n\n\nPrescription:\n----------\n\n**Linzess:** Primarily used for IBS-C it produces a good movement without too much effort. Problem is after about 2 weeks it starts to lose its effects and is no longer effective.\n\n**Movantik:** It's naloxegel. Basically well, [read this](https:\/\/www.movantikhcp.com\/about-movantik\/mechanism-of-action.html) It explains it much better than I can. \n\n","343":"Hey guys, it is almost 4am and I can't sleep.

It\u2019s her birthday. I wrote out an exceptionally long message about her and her story and was halfway through when it just made me cry. \n\nShe left her mother alone on earth and while her mother is loved by many, she\u2019s already lost her son to a diabetes complication 2-3\/years ago and now her daughter is gone as of September. \n\nThe wounds from this are still fresh.

It is not easy. I need to time meals with pain medication correctly and it\u2019s a very fine balance because one misstep means a miserable amount of pain.\n\nSome days will be worse than others, but it\u2019s finally manageable. As my health has improved I have been able to reach out to my extensive network. At this very moment I\u2019m being considered for an executive position with a massive company that is world famous. \n\nNow, if only someone could shut the crow that has been stalking my porch up \u2013 I\u2019d be exceptionally happy.

In the past it has been to places like animal shelters.  This year I called my parents up and got $50 from each of them.

Get a Narcan package and be as safe as you possibly can be. &amp; most importantly - Good Luck out there. ","346":"The day seemed to go smoothly. I spent a few hours on campus, dropped off the final and skipped out on class. I remember being confronted by the teacher\u2019s assistant, \u201cWhy are you leaving early?\u201d  he barked at my friend and I as we attempted to leave the 300-student lecture hall. I responded with, \u201cI\u2019ve got a class to drop and family business to take care of. I\u2019ve attended every lecture and I need to go.\u201d He couldn\u2019t keep me there and I left.\n\nHe seemed puzzled by my commitment to family, that family was more important to me than school. I remember him protesting to me, lecturing me that family, places to be, and things to do would always be there. That I should seize hold of my education and opportunity ahead of me.\n\nAt that moment I agreed with him, and to be honest, I was just being a terrible student in that moment.\n\nIt was the end of the term, I was having a good day and I didn\u2019t feel like sitting through the professor\u2019s last lecture. The class had been a complete bore the entire term. All he did was discuss his missed dreams of Hollywood and tell melodramatic stories about what could have been. I wasn\u2019t about to miss out on life happening right now to listen to him moan about how it did not happen for him.\n\nAfter leaving the classroom and getting home, I received a call from my father. He wanted to talk. I had no idea what was going on. \n\nWhen they arrived, I saw my mother\u2019s face, a picture of distress and anguish, an expression that is the definition of pure anguish, and without words I reached out to hug her, knowing something was horribly amiss. But before I could dive in for that hug, dad touched my shoulder and simply said, \u201cHe's dead.\u201d I crumpled to the ground in what was a collapse in tears of incomprehensible grief.\n\nSomehow we made it to my couch.  I don\u2019t think, sitting on that couch that afternoon on November 30th, 2010, anything had ever been as dreadful and heartbreaking to me as that single moment in time. From there, time passed over like a glossy, unreal film. A young, seemingly healthy 20-year-old boy was dead, and it wasn\u2019t any 20-year-old boy\u2014it was my parent\u2019s son and my brother. \n\nI packed up my bags, knowing I\u2019d be staying in the family home for a little bit now. I felt as though I were on autopilot as tears faded and shock immediately set in.\nYou see he died from a Heroin overdose. He was cold upon discovery. He died alone in his room. I'll never get to see his kids or meet his girlfriend. I will never be able to lean on him and I will never be able to let him lean on me. I never got to celebrate his 21st birthday with him and I\u2019ll never get to tease him about turning 30. All I have is 20 precious years that were far more valuable than I could have thought.\n\nGuys, be careful out there, if you have not done so already I urge you to get a kit from \/u\/traceyh415. Her program is life saving and I only wish my brother had his own kit. I miss him terribly. I wish he was here everyday. I\u2019ll tell you when you lose someone close, it doesn\u2019t matter how much time has gone by. 5years later it is still as painful as the day it happened. The only real difference is that I have better ways of coping and dealing with the pain. Otherwise, I\u2019d be a puddle of mush day in and day out. Be careful and be safe out there. \n\n*NOTE: I know a lot of people here have a bit of hate here towards myself. I am posting this because today would be my brother's 25th birthday. He died when he was 20 years old from a Heroin overdose if just one person here thinks twice or* ***gets a kit from \/u\/traceyh415 - I know I'll have done my part.*** *Drama or not, its worth it to me to post and leave this reminder.*\n","347":"I really spent some time debating if it was worth it for me to post here or not. I originally had a plan to post on October 24th and November 29th to commemorate the life and death of my brother due to Heroin. \n\nHowever, I'm back a bit sooner with some very sad news. My older cousin in her late 20s was found almost a week ago on Thursday. It is unknown what her cause of death is at this point in time is. However, there is a very strong chance that it was a Heroin Overdose. Back in May, I reconnected with her after not being in contact for over a decade. \n\nIn fact the last memory of her I have aside from the recent past was when I was about 11 or 12. \n\nShe grew into a beautiful adult. Despite her struggles she was supposedly clean. She constantly would reassure her mother that she would never die of an overdose. That people who die, die because they start out at their old dosage and that causes them to die. She knew better and if a relapse occurred she would take it slow and deal with it. She also swore to her mother that there was no way she'd ever go back to Heroin.\n\nYou see 3years after my brother died, so did hers, due to a diabetes complication (unrelated to drugs). \n\nWe reconnected back in May. No longer children, but adults who have seen more than most do in a lifetime. It felt good to have her around. We seemed more like sisters and for me, the idea of being left alone without my brother seemed to evaporate because she would be there for me and I would be there for her. We got really close really quick. \n\nWe would talk almost daily by phone or text message. We had long talks about everything as we got super close in the recent past. \n\nI was just scrolling through my messages with her. We were discussing AA Meetings because she wanted me to go with her. I turned her down because, I felt  it would be too triggering for me and that I would feel like a misfit with my pain condition that requires medication. \n\nDuring this conversation, I took the plunge and mentioned this SubReddit. She confirmed she had an account and would participate here in the past, but hadn't been here recently. \n\nI will update if I find her username... soon as I get into town for the services I will see if her aunt will allow me to see her laptop. If you have a female facebook friend who has passed away recently and their name begins with an \"L\" please feel free to PM me. I would be very grateful to know about it. Seeing as there is a likelihood it was her. \n\nI'm sorry I don't have her username. I just know she was a member of the community and is now gone. I can't even comprehend it.\n\nThere's a chance this wasn't a drug overdose, that it was a freak thing. Only time will tell, but it probably was an overdose.\n\nFor all the users and members of the community that have suffered a loss or death due to drugs, may you find peace.\n\nEDIT: This is a blanket comment for anyone who feels they need to harass me. I honestly thought about posting this under a throwaway, for fear of being ridiculed yet again. Apparently, I'm super controversial here.\n\nJust to keep things transparent, yes there's been some drama. Yes, I posted [this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/3clrg0\/see_ya_later_fuckers_the_ride_was_great\/) almost 3 months ago. \n\nYes, I decided to post today in light of recent events. Mainly to see if anyone could possibly pair me up with her username and a reminder that NO ONE is immune from a drug overdose. All it takes is just a little bit too much or a bad cut to end up dead.\n\nI made this post to inform, the community of a loss of life. Regardless of everything I felt it was important to share. Especially, since my cousin was a member of the SubReddit.\n\nNow, with that said, you'll probably hear from me on October 24th and November 29th in remembrance of my brother. I feel strongly that if just one person here gets something out of the mistakes made by those around me, then the hate is absolutely worth it.\n\nIf you don't like it, use RES to put me on ignore and\/or just downvote and move on. That is all.","348":"I know these posts are hated. I honestly do NOT give a flying fuck anymore. I'm obviously severely disliked\/hated\/unwelcomed here. I'm gonna jet. This will be my ***LAST*** post in this SubReddit. \n\nI will not be responding to any messages here.\n\nI'm sorry, but the hate around here isn't worth being a member of the community.\n\nSo \/u\/annoyingopiates and others you have achieved your goal... I'll leave you all alone.\n\nTo those who have been kickass and awesome, thank you so much for a great ride. I have made some valuable friendships. If you need to get ahold of me feel free to PM me. Most of you (&amp; You know who you are) can get ahold of me in other ways.\n\nThis isn't anything against \/r\/opiates - just those who make this place so bitter that it isn't worth it. I am of the opinion that if the internet is upsetting you - it's time to take a fucking break from it and this subreddit has been the source of a great deal of negative feelings. I no longer come on excited to share or help out and offer what I know. \n\nInstead, I worry about being *judged,* *yelled at,* *downvoted,* and *ridiculed.*\n\nSee you all in another life.","349":"So, I have been under an incredibly stressful few days. Basically to sum it up my therapy team started making a lot of outlandish claims:\n\n*\"You're eating food daily when you're not supposed to be!\"*\n\n*\"You're not following your pain pill script! You're abusing the medications!\"*\n\n*\"You're lead surgeon lied to make himself look good, you don't really have a GI Disorder!\"*\n\nJust to name a few of the weird things I've heard in this parallel universe over the last two days. My parents were brought in on all of this and it was the last claim that I don't \"really have a GI disorder\" that damaged the credibility of the Psychiatrist making that statement. \n\nI handed the psychiatrist my medical records that state there was a test done and it was positive. Something I could not fake even if I wanted to. He didn't seem to give a damn and I was pissed. \n\nAnyway, we sat down as a family today and decided to ***not*** put me in Rehab, especially since my pain doctor is okay with me being on the medications I am on. My Pain Doctor today was really happy that I was off the Lyrica, Tramadol and Topamax. He also validated my illness stating he had reviewed the operative reports and knows what a difficult thing what I have can be.\n\nI expressed that I'm sure there's some level of psychosis alongside all fo the medical stuff ad at some point pain and whatnot can be amplified but so long as I remain in therapy with my trusted psychiatrist (not the 2nd opinion or the therapy team) he feels I will be good!\n\nSuch a fucking relief. I can't even. ","350":"So, I saw a psychiatrist that I was hoping would have some brains to do a consult with in regards on how to handle my medical &amp; physiatric issues. I don't deny that I have a physiatrist history or anything of the sort.\n\nI just feel that this psychiatrist who originally promised to look at my medical records as well as my psych history only took into account my psych records and not my medical history.\n\nUpon asking him what he thought of the surgical reports he was just like, \"I don't think anything was wrong and that operation should have been performed.\" He went on to say that my surgeon, \"was overreaching in his diagnosis in order to make himself look better and unlike he did an unnecessary surgery.\" Which, is a load of bullshit and an audacious claim. Especially from someone who did not read that operative report or look at those documents at all.\n\nIt just felt like he was chraging us a ton of money to blow smoke up my ass. \n\nHe claims that if I take different medications for my depression my pain and physical wellbeing will get better. I disagree strongly. There is no medication that makes this better. I require a multipronged approach from all aspects and closing the door on viable treatment options be it pain management, GI medications or whatever and replacing it with antipsychotics and therapy is a bad idea.\n\nThis isn't all or nothing. I want to take a multipronged approach to this use pain medication, therapy, antidepressants etc. together to achieve a wellbeing.\n\nWhat people fail to see is I'm finally somewhat happy. I'm doing *well* I'm not broken at the moment to a point where it is making me unhappy. There is no denying I am broken since I can't eat but making false promises that if I do certain things without narcotics I can eat again just seems shortsighted. \n\nI don't want to gamble on a fix that could make me worse. \n\nThe current regime is working. Why fuck with it? I did this under the pressure of my family and a psych team that I am just about ready to fire. \n\nI think starting today I'm making my own medical decisions and building my team appropriately. \n\nI know some of you are going to come in here and challenge me about all of this. I am very stressed right now and will be explicit with what I need right now:\n\n(1) Support &amp; Understanding - not to be confused with pity party or sympathy\n\n(2) Practical advice or what you would do if you were faced with my situation.\n\n(3) Please do not patronize me, I just don't need it right now\n\n(4) No tough love - I'm not in the mood to hear \"harsh realiities\"\n\n(5) Take a caring approach with kindness\n\n(6) I don't want you to bullshit me but please don't be harsh. I don't need that either.\n\n(7) If you only have mean things to say or \"I told you so\" keep your trap shut. ","351":"*I feel like doing something nice\/fun. So, let us play a game:*\n\nLeave a comment summoning someone on this subreddit that you haven't talked to in awhile and say something nice\/positive about them. \n\nThe first 6 people to do so - I will give them and whoever they summon some Reddit gold :-).\n\nJust thought some Saturday love was in order!

I heard Lyrica was good for fighting W\/Ds.

As many of you know I'm not in my regular city\/state. Instead, I'm visiting elsewhere,  well while in elsewhere I've been panicking and having some issues with potentially running out of my narcotic script.\n\nI even posted a little bit ago about how I might go about getting an emergency supply and decided against contacting my doctor about that for fear he may find things highly suspicious or think that I ran out of my script too early and just needed an early refill or whatever. \n\nAnyway, I ended up with some bad vomiting last night and was forced to go to the ER where I am visiting. I started the visit off by just getting the necessary medications - zofran, fluids, torodol just until labs and XRays came back etc., etc., to see if I'd be justified to accept narcotics.\n\nAnyway, my XRay came back showing severe Gastroenteritis. The doctor at the ER administered a total of 2mg of IV Dialudid and wrote for a script of 20 5\/325oxycodones for the increased pain I'm expected to have over the next 2-3weeks. \n\nSo, today I called my regular pain doctor before filling the script and led with, *\"I wont fill this if you don't want me to...\"* My pain doctor thanked me for calling him and said it would be fine to fill the script and that I did the right thing by going to the ER. \n\nI thanked him for being reasonable and just explained that I didn't want to go against his orders. He seemed really receptive of that and was just great overall.\n\nNot that he would've been bad had he said no to my request - I just would have dealt with it and suffered through, but finally having a doctor on my side who is willing to treat me like a respectable human is excellent.\n\nLike so much relief right &amp; now I can enjoy my trip without stressing!\n\nxxx,\n\nDori\n\n","355":"I'm just wondering in this atypical hypothetic if this would work\/be okay:\n\nI'm thinking of getting in touch with my pain doctor to see if he'll write me a bit of an extended perscription because, I am fearful that I am going to be out of my perscription before my next appointment.\n\nThing is I am out of state from my hometown and won't be back in my state until just a few days before my next appointment.\n\nSo I do not want to bother my doctor if this can't happen - hence why I'm asking here....\n\nCan my doctor write a pen &amp; paper prescription for Oxycodone to be picked up by my family and then my family member can drop the prescription off at a big chain pharmacy (like CVS\/Walgreens\/Etc...) from there I could maybe called the pharmacy in my current area\/state and they can pull &amp; fill that script here for me?\n\nOr is that just completely impossible.\n\nI know I recently had 5 prescriptions filled here using that method but none of those were narcotics. \n\nPlease Advise Thanks!","356":"I swear to fucking junkie jesus this has *got* to be in my head at this point. I was having some bad pain issues yesterday &amp; I'm not running low on my script but, I'm not like rolling around in all the medication either. \n\nSo I haven't taken anything for a good 3-4 days and then yesterday with the pain I was like, \"here lemme cut up a 5mg to make 2.5mgs and see if that helps!\" worked like charm. Took 2.5mg around 4pm and then around 9pm I took another 2.5mg and was good to go. \n\nAnyway, 3pm today rolls around and I noticed my nose getting very  runny - but I wasn't having any pain. So, I sat and then I squirmed and then about 2hrs later at 5pm I decided to take another 2.5mg half to just hopefully get myself through whatever uncomfiness I was feeling.\n\nNow I'm swimming in a sea of warmth and my nose is no longer running.\n\nHoly fuck balls... was I in withdrawals!?!? From a 5mg oxycodone?!?!? WTF is *wrong* with me and my better question is HOW THE HELL AM I HIGH OFF 2.5mg right now. \n\nWhich leads me to believe that all this crap about nose running and withdrawals has got to be in my head.\n\nExcept, my nose was most definitely sniffly and wet and cold an hour ago and that is not the case after taking this dose of medication. \n\nBlargh... any thoughts on this?","357":"Winning the war on drugs is simple, you see all that needs to happen is this:\n\n1.

I saw a new pain doctor to whom I spoke very candidly to. Told him about the bullshit, the shit I've been through and that I've just been dragging myself along best I can. \n\nThis pain doctor is **NO BS** ... he took one list of my long list of medications and was just like, *wtf, why are you on 4 different non-narcotic pain medication that aren't doing shit?!* and I was kinda like, \"that's been my arguement but no one seems to want to touch it\/listen to me about it and my previous pain doctor was dead set against scripting narcotics because of my brother's death.\" \n\nFor context purposes my brother died 5years ago of a Heroin Overdose and my previous pain doctor felt that addiction was something that was inevitable for me if he were to prescribe me a pain med so instead he had me on 3-5 non-narcotic pain medications to \"manage\" the situation. I finally got frustrated with him when he started pushing AA Meetings on me when I had never had an issue with drug abuse or encounter with opiates outside of a doctor perscribed setting and dropped him as a doctor. \n\nSo, this new doctor who was referred to me by my blood doctor who is a prominent cancer specialist (I don't have cancer - just iron issues) really listened to me and felt that it was appropriate to remove the Lryica, Topamax, Tramadol, &amp; potentially the Linzess and replace it with a low dose of Baclofen and an Oxycodone 5mg PRN Script.\n\nIn fact he was ready to put me on Oxy's daily &amp; we discussed how that should be a thing eventually, but for the time being if we can put that off for as long as possible - then that is going to be the best bet. So I got a small script, nothing huge, but it's a big deal to me a bottle of 30 5mg IR Oxycodone tablets to last me 6weeks. The instruction reads to take \"1-2 as needed for pain\" \n\nThis is a dream for me. It will keep me out of that damned ER and will help me deal with the pain on a manageable level. I can handle a 3-5 sometimes even a 6 on the pain scale. It's when it jumps to a 7-9 that I am really suffering and this script is going to tackle those days when my pain is at 7+. I'm literally so relieved I could cry. In fact, I think I'm going to go ahead and cry. It's been a long ass journey and hopefully they're finally willing to manage my situation. Maybe my team is finally falling into place.\n\nThere is hope.\n\nxxx,\n\nDori\n\nPS: For those who do not know, I have a feeding tube, I have a rare disorder that causes chronic pancreatitis. The feeding tube helps with this, but I still have pain from the original disorder + having a tube surgically implanted into my body. I've been strictly tube fed for two years and have not consumed food orally in that time period with the exception of just a few rare breakdown moments that made me very sick....","359":"***sMILEs***\n----\n\n'cause there's a MILE between the S's!\n\n**Happy Saturday Everyone** \n\nHope you are fantastic.

Unfortunately, he is not in a position to prescribe me any kind of pain medication. So, instead he's been working on finding out why these doctors do not wish to take on my case and\/or why they will not prescribe me pain medication.\n\n***They think I might be suicidal and may kill myself with said pain medication script...***\n\nThis pisses me off for a number of reasons:\n\n1) It's insulting\n\nGreat. Now, that's out of the way. Of course, it's insulting, now what? Well, it is also valid. As well as disappointing that no one has felt comfortable enough to address this with me directly. Instead it has been thought that I be better left in the dark about it, left wondering and confused. That in and of itself is infurriating. \n\nBut, back to valid. Yes, I have a history of sucicidality. Once when I was 16 (10 years ago) and another time just after my brother died (4years ago) when you look at my history of actual suicidality and what took place, I always reached out for help and there was never an attempt on my own life accidental or otherwise. So, yes it is valid, yes I have a history of depression &amp; mental illness, yes it is well managed, yes I am under the care of a therapy team &amp; a psychiatrist, no have none of my pain management specialist ever wished to reach out to said people. Which, is just *irresponsible* in my opinion if they are going to deny a legit pain patient pain medication for that reason without consulting their psych team...\n\nWell then my blood doctor made a very valid point to me, **\"these specialists are just as responsible for overtreating you as they are for undertreating you - if you buy off the street and die, they are still at fault insurance wise. They think they're covering their asses however, they are not.\"**\n\nWhich, is great and all. But eghhhgwwads it so does not help me right now. \n\nMy pain doctor then made a second referral to an outside pain management specialist who I now have an appointment with for later on in the month. Hoping to hell he takes me on and works with me. Otherwise, I'm pretty much at the end of my rope suffering wise. \n\nIt doesn't help that my brother died of a Heroin Overdose either. I feel as if that is haunting me a lot lately too.\n\nAnyway, not doing too well. I'll see myself out now &amp; for those of you who are sick of my updates you can see yourself out too no-one is forcing you to read them and for those of you who have shown your continued support I am forever grateful.

You may not.\n\nEssentially, I'm to angry, upset, and just flat out beaten up to go through the latest development.\n\nJust some key things to those who care (or don't):\n\n* Apparently the information that I violated my pain contract was false information.

Today is a gift taht is why it is called the present.\n* I am beauty &amp; brains\n* I stick by my values: Health, Family, Friends, Giving Back\n* I refuse to be put in a box and labeled. \n* My identity is fluid. \n* Emotions change every 15minutes or so, lets see how I feel then.\n\nI actually have them *written* down and posted in my kitchen!\n\nThe next step after I took some time to create this list that I could believe\/buy into\/understand\/achieve, I went about my day normally, except when I'd catch myself thinking about \"what a dumb fuck I am\" I'd pause and take a deep breath before letting it really hurt me in that same moment of taking a breath I'd pull from my statement\/affirmations and go, \"I am beauty and brains\"\n\nBAM! POW! CHICAWOWOW! \n\nInstantaneous mood boost.  \n\nSo my challenge to you is to (1) Tell me (or not!) 1-3 mantras and\/or sayings designed for you, that you believe you can actually use and be excited about using. (2) Do it once this weekend and just make a mental note on how you felt after you tried it. Did you go back to the situation\/group? Did you feel empowered? (3) Write down anything from 1 word to thousands of pages focusing on what, why, when, how, where. \n\nDefine yourself outside of being whatever it is that you dislike (or even do like). Just like I am not my physical illness you are not whatever issue is stressing you out at this very moment.\n\nI don't know. I felt compelled to share this knowledge in hopes it helps - I know this type of thinking has gotten me through some pretty terrible days. \n\nStay beautiful \/r\/opiates!","363":"HALP!\n\nI'm not normally an angry person. Tell me about you. Anything about you. I need some sincere distracting from this crap. My old pain clinic has jaded the view of all my other reputable doctors and it has left me in the dust in regards to getting treatment. \n\nNo wonder my GI a few months back thought I needed to go to the psychward and get evaluated, which I did and they told my GI if my pain was better managed I wouldn't be a psych case anymore, and my GI had me take that inforamtion to my new pain doctor who told me that the psych people just were passing the buck on me. That he cared. So he offered a few things to try and I have been giving them an honest shot.\n\nEverytime I walk into my current pain doctors office he tells me about how I'm too high risk for addiction, how because of everything I've been through, I'm just too high of a risk and I was assuming he meant my brother... he told me to go to an AA meeting or an NA meeting this last visit....\n\nI reacted by telling him that I thought it'd make me really sad to remember my brother like that and I'd think about it. \n\nIt wasn't till I was home thinking about it that I picked up the phone and found out I had been dismissed from my old pain clinics care. I wasn't simply discharged from my old pain doctor I was dismissed. I asked what the difference was and was finally told that it was on record I had broken my pain contract.\n\nI explained, I was *discharged*, with a referral to try suboxone offlabel , ***for pain,*** and that the doctor then never mentioned anything about breaking my pain contract. That I was never told I had done this, that it did take me awhile to go ahead and try the subxone because, it was a \"scary\" drug for me and that I had seizure on it and informed their offices of said seizure and was told it was merely a suggestion to go ahead and try suboxone and that they could no longer help me. \n\nThat whatever was in their notes about the way I was discharged or what had happened has been negatively impacting the way I receive care in the ER is truly traumatic and that I've been struggling day in and day out for a long 6months off all narcotics with the exception of 7 ER visits and 3 Hospitalizations in 6 months. \n\nSadly, that is the lowest number of hospital encounters in recent times than ever before....\n\nThey seemed surprised that I haven't had a script at home since August. Said, they'd look into it further and would get back to me. I'm just hurt. Really hurt and hurting.\n\nI'm just so blood boiling angry. I don't know. Tell me about you.","364":"Ugh. I don't even know how this is possible. I developed a sore throat around 7pm and for some reason no matter what I do I can't get comfy enough to get to sleep. It is now almost 3:30am and I haven't slept a wink. I'm a bit worried because I have a 10:30am appointment and my day is go, go, go from then till 3 in the afternoon. Ugh. FML. I'm not withdrawing from anything or even currently using. \n\nI seriously hope I'm not coming down with some kind of strange sore throat. It is the last thing I need just after I was starting to feel better emotionally and everything.\n\nI even took a bit of Ativan and it didn't knock me out. Ugh. Maybe just the stress about all the crap with my medical stuff is finally eating at me bad enough to keep me up all night that along with the soreness of my throat and the runny tummy I have from the antibiotic just has me screwed up. \n\nAnyway, how everyone? What's your latest and greatest? Tell me about your day\/week\/month. What's your story?","365":"Hey Guys!!!\n\nSo, the bad news first:\n\nI had a super discouraging doctors appointment. He was way overly judgmental. Saying shit like that my ER Visit was not a good thing and that he understands I'm in pain but that I need to work through going to the ER. I pointed out that it had been 6weeks since I last visited the hospital and last time I stayed for 2days and this time I left the ER after 12hrs so that was an improvement from this time last year when I was in the ER like weekly. \n\nIt just pissed me off because he told me to be great its not about what you have achieved but its about what you're going to achieve. Which my mom liked, for whatever reason, but I hated it. Because, I have come so far and I have done really well and I have followed his lead (for the most part). He wasn't my doctor a year ago when things were horrid so I don't think he realizes what a huge accomplishment this was for me.\n\nAlso, he bitched about my weight for a long ass time because, I guess the high triglyceride levels in my body from sudden weight gain can contribute to my pancreatic pain. (I've gained about 30lbs in 3months). So, he lectured me quite a bit. I took it with stride - I've struggled with my weight for most of my young adult life so now that I'm in my mid-twenties - I know all about it &amp; the simple equation to loose weight. I get it. I have no excuse my caloric intake is perfectly measured to the last small calorie because of my feeding tube. &amp; I just need to actually work out vs. just walking the dog leisurely. He wants me to work up a sweat 15minutes per day but that so is not going to happen at least not anytime soon. He claimed my current regime with the dog is for like 60-80year olds and that I'm 25 so I should be doing more. *Should've, Would've, Could've,* I mean REALLY!?\n\nAnyway, now good news:\n\nI was able to get a back supply of my stuff. My guy got it to me in an exceptionally fast manner and put me on the honor system fronting me just a small amount (which, I have since paid up). So, that was excellent. So, even though my pain doctor wont help narcotic wise - I'm at least covered for the next 20 days before I have to do withdrawals etc., to pass my drug test at my stupid pain doctors office next time. \n\n&amp; In other news my pain doctor did put me on topamax (aka dopeamax because, it gives you brain fog), and that helps with weightloss + pain typically migraine type pain which could help my small headaches and potentially my pancreatic pain - we will see. So that's good. Not only that but I got my supply of celebrex too, so with starting that we should see a difference pain wise. *fingers crossed!!!*\n\nHe also mentioned that my weight gain could be partially due to the increase in Lyrica so having the topamax to combat that will be super useful.\n\nIn other good news - my boyfriend bought a plane ticket out to see me again in May &amp; him + me might meet up in Vegas in April so all of that stuff is good and exciting.\n\nOverall, my quality of life has drastically improved and I'm just so happy about that. It's just hard dealing with the severe daily pain, but like I said at least I'm covered till my next drug test. For those wondering why I take 10days to withdraw vs. 3 or 5 is to leave buffer room for slipping up and needing something within the first 5days and then I have an extra 5days to just be clean + it helps with keeping my tolerance in check and not only that it is financially beneficial so yah. yep. It sucks but it works!\n\nJust felt like sharing iono. Didn't expect to write so freaking much. Anyway stay beautiful \/r\/opiates!!!\n\nxxx,\n\nDori","366":"Hey All You Awesome Folks!\n\nYou may remember [my last post here,](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/2xhzlz\/idgf_anymore\/) where I was all kinds of depressed and struggling with withdrawal.

So that is something &amp; I'll catch all you fun folk on TinyChat yea yeah? \n\n:-)\n\nOh &amp; as far as the drugs go - I'm not sure if I'm gonna keep up this crazy cycle of 10days off 20days on per month with the Oxycodones. I'll have to see what my pain doc wants to do with me first. But, yah I'm considering just biting the bullet and dealing with the pain on a more holistic level but I do want stuff in stock for those crazy emergencies. So yeppers.\n\n^ _ ^","367":"I'm really feeling depressed. Withdrawing from Oxy atm. I need to pass my drug test in 10days and I ran out early so here I am detoxing. Fuck this shit so much.

No matter the physical pain consequences. I just can't be fogged out all the time anymore. \n\nIt just sucks. It breaks my heart to post this for some reason. IDK why. It just does. I guess I just really wish my doctors would take me seriously. Living with what I have isn't easy and more than that I just want to be okay.","369":"Hey guys!\n\nIn case any of you were wondering what might've happened to me *cough*\/u\/NoTimeLikeToday*cough*\/u\/kittykins89*cough*\/u\/pinkpixie81*cough* I am doing fantastic.

I've got a feeding tube and my doctors aren't great. Which has resorted to me using an old back supply of opiates but I have to be clean for 10days prior to my pain doctor appointments for drug testing. I know I can go less but I need to be 100% clean and they lab test it so I leave 10days as a good buffer every month + it helps my tolerance.\n\nAnyway talk soon! Tell me something interesting about you!","371":"I may or may not be drug tested at my pain doctors office. I've been on 7.5mg - 20mg of oxycodone. My last dose was 7.5mg about 24hrs ago. \n\nMy appointment is on the 13th of January. There is NO WAY I can test \"dirty\" for oxycodone at this appointment. How many days before the appointment should I stay off the oxycodone? I have been reading that its 3-4days for it to get out of the urine but if its a really important test then give it 5days. \n\nIs this accurate? Also does the amount of water consumption make a difference?","372":"He would be 24 today. Today is October 24th, 2014. He would be 24.\n\nOn November 29th, 2010 he passed away from a Heroin Overdose. It is suspected that he had injected himself and missed and then did another hit to get high. Later on the first one that he missed caught up with the dose that he got right and it slowed his respiratory rate and eventually caused him to die. The coroner said, *\"I just don't understand, he had barely enough to kill himself with it. This should not have happened.\"* He died alone upstairs in his room.\n\n**He was my younger brother dead at 20 and I was left hopeless at 22**. We never knew he was on Heroin. We never knew what was happening or how deep into drugs he really was. We thought at best he was into Cannabis and a few pills here and there. We thought it was all manageable. We were wrong.\n\nI'll never forget that day finding out. Or the fact that the night he died was the night of my parents 23rd wedding anniversary.\n\nJust a reminder to stay safe out there. Just stay safe.\n\n*Edit 10\/24\/14 @ 5pm PST: I just wanted to say thank yo so much to everyone for your amazing well wishes.

There is nothing more unfortunate than losing your life to your drug addiction. I've seen what it does to the family\/friends and it's not pretty.*","373":"Hey,\n\nSo, I thought I'd be better. My doctors told me I would be better. That I should be excited about going off my pain medications and that there was no reason for my pain. I took my last dose of 2.5mg of Oxycodone Saturday. I vomited a bit last week but it was okayish. Today, I've vomited 5times and the pain is killing me. I've taken Tylenol and my prescribed tramadol only to vomit that up again.  \n\nI'm on a feeding tube. I haven't had any food in a year. I fear that while the tube helps it is by no means a cure. Like my doctor thinks it is. \n\nI'm just sobbing, I feel like such a failure for needing the narcotics, but who am I kidding? I'm not getting any today. Unless, if I go to the ER but now I have a dog to take care of. I love him to death. He's helped me so much these past two weeks. \n\nNo one needs to live in such pain. I don't understand why my doctors feel this insane need to deny me a quality of life. I am a lab rat.","374":"Hey \/r\/Opiates,\n\nI've been through the mill and back again. I developed a painful pancreatic condition in my early 20s and it has followed me for years. Now, my doctors are insisting I get off my pain medication. That it wasn't helping anything. Only making this worse. At first I wI had a lot of resentment and stubborn about it and refused to do it. \n\nUntil 10days ago. I adopted a dog. He is a total love bug and when I'm in pain he curls up on me or next to me. This dog lowers all my anxiety, blood pressure and heart rate. Thus allowing my pain to be very minimal. This week has been incredible and I cannot wait to get my life back together with my dog in tow.\n\nI am on 5mg of oxy tomorrow is my last dose at that dosage. Then, the next four days are half pills or about 2.5mg of oxycodone. I'm so excited about this. Even though I had so much resistance to the plan originally, with this dog - things are so much better. :-) I now get a fair shot at life!","375":"Hey! \n\nSo, I have chronic pain issues. Has anyone ever heard of Suboxone being used for pain? What was the experience like? I just saw a Suboxone doctor who specializes in it for pain but, he doesn't take my insurance and was $545 for today's visit. Fucking outrageous. It really, really, really sucked.\n\nThis doctor treats patients with pain issues specifically with Suboxone. He also works with a few Heroin addicts as well, but it is not a clinic, it is a doctors office where this is his specialty and he's an internist.\n\nI have chronic abdominal pain from a rare bile duct disorder (It's kinda like Crohns with a ton of pancreatitis episodes)....\n\nThe doctor obviously gave me a lot of information but I was wondering if anyone here is on it for pain or knows someone who is\/was on it for pain and what happened with them? What kind of pain condition was\/is present and if there's EXTRA pain or \"FLARES\" how does Suboxone work\/help?\n\nInsights are greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nDori","376":"So my last dose of Methadone was the 22nd of May and my last Oxycodone dose was Friday the 20th of June. I did have to take some Oxycodone on Tuesday the 24th of June due to a Gastroinstinal bleed that was causing pain and then on Thursday the 26th of June around 1am I was treated in the ER for the bleed and they gave me Dilaudid but, I feel like Tuesday\/Thursdays uses were warranted.\n\nIt is now Saturday and my Gastrointestinal symptoms are under control and so is the pain. (last real pain med dose was Wednesday night\/early Thursday morning) I still have bad abdominal pain, but I'm learning to breathe\/be off the narcotics with it. I'm slowly but surely noticing improvements.\n\nThe methadone withdrawals were intense and triggered some psychotic issues for me but I managed to stay home and was able to deal with it. Then came the oxycodone withdrawals and I swear the biggest thing with that was my runny nose for days on end. Right now I'm just on a muscle relaxant and Tylenol and it seems to be pretty much doing the job.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to share my story in case anyone could relate\/was going off stuff themselves while in chronic pain. It is possible to get clean and not use narcotics everyday and more as a rescue medication. So yah. xD.","377":"So, I tried to jump off about two weeks ago from a 2.5mg dose and had to go back on it. Now, I am jumping off again and it hasn't been easy. I jumped off at 1.25 and for the first 2 days it was at least manageable. Then yesterday, day 3 I flipped a  lid. \n\nEvery bone in my body hurt and to make things worse I was experiencing auditory hallucinations. Mind you I'm prone to those so it wasn't that much of a surprise and I'm proud of my parents for helping me make it though the night. It sure wasn't easy with all my shenanigans. \n\nI apparently from what I'm told I dialed 911 twice and my parents spoke to the operator and said I was fine. Apparently they weren't too happy with 2 calls from my household and did not come out.\n\nUltimately I'm glad because I didn't end up wasting a week of my life at the hospital and am a lot better today but getting through last night was absolute murder between the bone pain and auditory hallucinations.\n\nHowever, I have parents who love me dearly and they both slept next to me and kept rubbing my body to help the bone pain and to soothe me. So they are kinda awesome.\n\nIt sucks having this disability and when my parents no longer exist I will have to go to the hospital but right now I understand they are here for me and can help me greatly.\n\nRight now I'm looking into an IOP and just getting back ontrack. The hallucinations are gone and the withdrawals and becoming less and less severe. Although god damn bone pain is the worst.\n\nAnyway it is day 4 going on day 5 and the hallucinations are gone.The bones still hurt but I figure once I sleep that'll go away - we'll see and overall I'm starting to feel better.

So I was on a tolerance break, made it to day 3 which isn't bad, when I started vomiting like crazy. I was taken to the Emergency Room loaded up on IV Dialudid &amp; hospitalized.

What would that look like? Was he really done with drugs? \n\nHe expressed interest in coming here and doing rehab and we hatched a plan. We expected it to take till January to really happen because of his legal issues across the country. \n\nWell, he was able to cut a deal for time served in the summer and early August he was sitting in my living room. We got him signed up with social services and within 3 days of arriving he was in a non-profit rehab facility in town that is known to be very good. \n\nI thought for sure he'd run.\n\nHe surprised me and didn't run. Instead he's stayed and he's doing the fucking hard work it takes to recover. I'm just so fucking proud of him. He's been there almost 3 months. He plans to do their outpatient program even! I'm excited for him to be my neighbor and friend in recovery. &lt;3.","389":"It\u2019s Monday\u2026\n\n\u2026&amp; I am doing much [better since my last post.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/oy9vpm\/im_fucking_sad\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).  It\u2019s funny how when I\u2019m sad, mad, craving or feeling anything negative it seems like it\u2019s never ending. However, I\u2019m learning that the more I resist giving into temptation and do not relapse the stronger I am becoming.  \n\nToday I feel so much better. I got a ton of solid sleep and rest this weekend which was incredibly helpful and I told a few people around me how I was feeling. That really helped me. \n\nI also decided on a whim to start my YouTube channel and just jump into it. That\u2019s definitely a passion project and I just wanted to express that I\u2019m proud of myself for doing it because that\u2019s been a goal of mine all year. I won\u2019t link it here because I\u2019m not into shameless promotion. I just wanted to talk about it a bit.  \n\nIn any event, today is a good day and I thought I\u2019d share something positive versus bitching about the negative.\n\nOpiate addiction is hard to deal with. The lows are plentiful, however the more I resist the \u201cfuck it\u2019s\u201d the better of a person I\u2019m becoming. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary today.  I\u2019m on my way to work, I will come home, do laundry, browse Reddit and go to bed. It\u2019ll be a relatively boring day and boring isn\u2019t so bad. After all, I\u2019ve lived in chaos for so long it\u2019s nice when things go well.","390":"[Just 6 days ago I celebrated 1 year clean.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/oubl5f\/today_is_significant\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) So, I feel really weird posting this today, but I gotta keep it real. I\u2019m suffering from extreme depression. I\u2019m beyond upset about it too. It\u2019s been a long road. \n\nFrom an outsiders perspective I have nothing to complain about. \n\nI\u2019m 1 year clean! What an accomplishment! I have an excellent job! People in my life love me! People believe in me! \n\nSomeone believes in me so much that they gave me something very special to them to celebrate my one year and as I graciously accepted it, thought it was cool as fuck, I also got very angry because now it means I can\u2019t relapse. If I do I\u2019ll destroy those around me and well \u2026 myself. \n\nI got angry that people care about me so much that they won\u2019t let me destroy my life.  \n\nI got mad that I care enough to not self destruct.  \n\nI told someone important to me today that I was tired and I felt felt like they dismissed it. \u201cIt\u2019s over 100 degrees here lately. Everyone is tired.\u201d They said. I felt so invalidated.  I kinda shut down a bit. Didn\u2019t want to go into how I\u2019m just depressed. After all, I just need to suck it up and keep on pressing on. Right? Right? \n\nIt\u2019s more than that though.  I\u2019m doing everything possible to handle my depression, I\u2019m on meds, in therapy, working a strong recovery program, being careful about my physical pain, and I plan on getting a full psych evaluation here in the near future and addressing my nutrition but, I can\u2019t help but wonder if it\u2019s worth it because I seem to be programmed to be depressed. I mean if I can\u2019t be happy after being a year clean and all the positivity in my life then what hope is there for me?\n\nI\u2019m not gonna relapse. I\u2019m just pissed off. I\u2019m not a victim. I just need to get this out there. This sounds so woe is me. Which, I know I hate doing.\n\nFuck depression.","391":"Today is significant because I am exactly 1 year clean. For those around here that knew me KNOW that today is a long time coming.\n\nI have been around r\/opiates for 9 whole years. It\u2019s only in the last three years I\u2019ve attempted to recover and it\u2019s only in the last year that I\u2019ve actually stayed clean! \n\nI describe myself as an egomaniac with and inferiority complex. I like attention but god forbid I ask someone for help. Yet\u2026\n\nA year ago today I didn\u2019t plan on not using anymore, I didn\u2019t have a one last use, but in a rare moment of clarity I reached out for help. In that moment I was thrown a life raft and since then I\u2019ve stuck with it. \n\nI have chronic pain. This year has been hard as hell. Heck, even [16 days ago I was convinced I\u2019d relapse](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/oja0s8\/i_am_insane\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), but I didn\u2019t. I stuck with my recovery and things changed. \n\nLife doesn\u2019t always suck. It isn\u2019t always great, but it\u2019s amazing that I can have the presence of mind to be a survivor and not a victim. \n\nXo, Dori","392":"I see the train coming, but I don't have the energy or will to stop it. I feel like a relapse is going to be unavoidable. I've already slipped into old behaviors and patterns. I've started gambling again and I noticed that I'm playing mental gymnastics with myself to justify using again. Right now the latest rationale is, \"get to your one year anniversary and then go do whatever you want.\" or, \"why can't you just start chipping. No one will know. how will they know?\"\n\nI see all of this. I know all of this, yet I don't know if I care enough to not relapse. Sometimes I feel so detached from myself. It's like an out of body experience. It's like I have no control over myself, yet I recognize how wrong I am and have incredible insight into it. I just can't control the compulsion to act out or destroy my life when things are going well.\n\nI became so used to chaos over the course of my life that I find it hard to sit still with me, myself, and I. I'm coming up on a year here at the end of the month and while I'm excited about it, I'm absolutely terrified.","393":"I am an opiate addict and I cannot believe it. This is the longest consecutive amount of clean time I've ever had. I'm really surprised I've made it this far. Especially because of my chronic pain and how I used to be. I was ALWAYS the victim. I hated the idea of NA and the only God that existed was junkie Jesus.\n\nToday, I am empowered. I have found that NA works fantastically for me (go figure) and I am so damn lucky that I survived my addiction thus far because not everyone does. I\u2019ve lost my brother and cousin to addiction and I\u2019ve seen the devastating results of that.\n\nI am proud to be a chronic pain patient in recovery from addiction.\n\nAt 8.5 months clean I was craving badly and it was looking like I wasn't going to make 9 months.\n\nI was ready to cave. I was scheming and scamming and had a whole relapse plan that I intended to carry out. Somehow though, someway, I realized that if I put as much effort into scheming as I might my recovery, I might have a shot.\n\nSo, instead of scheming and scamming as per usual, I tried something different, stepped entirely outside of my comfort zone and moved into a sober living.\n\nIt made all the difference for me. I now have 9 amazing roommates and I love living here for the time being.\n\nAsking for help 8.5 months in wasn't easy too. I knew without any kind of change though, I would relapse. I cannot help but be genuinely proud of myself right now for making it to 9 months.\n\nSo, now it's onto one year and beyond, one day at a time. I can do this.","394":"When I first joined r\/opiates nearly 10years ago 98% of the time it was all about wild stories and pill porn. Also, does anyone remember that mugshot trend we had here 8 or so years ago?\n\nToday it is very different. There\u2019s no pill porn and certainly no one is posting their selfies as mugshots, today there\u2019s a lot more talk about harm reduction and recovery. \n\nOne thing hasn\u2019t changed though everyone here is amazing. I\u2019ve met some of the best people on this subreddit over the years. \n\nJust wanted to share.","395":"I'm definitely obsessed with using. To the point where my brain goes, *\"don't take those antibiotics for your infection! Let it fester and you'll have a reason to accept drugs in the hospital when it gets really bad!\"* Yeah. It's fucking terrifying being inside my brain sometimes. Anyway, the next thought was, *\"Shut the fuck up, your guilt will consume you if you do that. If you're gonna go to those kinds of lengths it's easier to pick up on the streets.\"* So now here I am with all these ~~bright~~ stupid ideas, left thinking to myself, *\"WTF is wrong with you. Sthap. Just take your fucking antibiotic and stop trying to think up ways to self destruct.\"*\n\nSo, now I'm here on Reddit sharing the things my fucked up brain likes to tell me instead of self destructing....\n\nHow's your night going?","396":"Tomorrow I'll officially be 5 months sober and as I reflect on my journey this year -- it's hard to believe. This time last year I had gotten off Suboxone and convinced my doctors to put me back on Oxycodone. From there, I decided to get off the oxycodone in early February and returned to recovery.\n\nI didn't take it seriously though and I started cheating. Then on July 29th in a moment of clarity -- I guess -- I confessed to my therapist that I had been using on and off Between February and July. I had no intention of quitting. As far as I was concerned I was just going to chip and use opiates \"for pain,\" and be fine. \n\n*'cuz everything is fiiinnnnneeeeee.* (meanwhile everything is on fire). \n\nAnyway, that didn't happen. \n\nI started doing things differently. I decided to take each and every suggestion that was made to me with the best of intentions. Not every suggestion was right for me, but eventually, I found a system that worked for me. \n\nI still haven't used since July 29th, 2020. I even had a hospitalization in the past 5 months for my pancreas and didn't use opiates whatsoever during that time. If you'd seen or know me from this subreddit 2 years ago, you know that this is all a dramatic change for me.\n\nI know today is Christmas, but tomorrow I get a huge gift. The gift of being five months sober and I just wanted to share my story a bit in hopes of uplifting someone else here.\n\nXo, Dori.","397":"Why is it that growing up it takes 100 good things to compensate for 1 bad thing.  Like even now there could be 1 negative comment on a post and 100 good ones and my brain will be absorbed with the 1 negative thing...\n\nHowever, when I think back to my addiction I fixate on all the good things and ignore the rest. It\u2019s like the bad shit doesn\u2019t even matter but reverse that anywhere else in my life and it takes 100 good things to undo 1 bad. Whereas with addiction 100 good experiences heavily outweigh any kind of negative experiences.  \n\nWhat. The. Fuck. Is. This. Sorcery!?","398":"Age: Early 30's\n\nMedications: Prozac, Abilify, &amp; Wellbutrin\n\nMedical Condition: Depression and Substance Abuse Disorder\n\nI've been off of narcotics for 129 days. I've been experiencing post acute withdrawal syndrome to the point that I feel like I'm in active withdrawals out of nowhere, body aches, sweating, restless legs, etc. I was wondering would a dose of clonidine help with this or any other medication I should ask my doctor about?\n\nThanks.","399":"I've been posting about my brother on r\/opiates at the end of November for 8 years. This year is not any different. I want to bring awareness opioid addiction and how I've coped with it over the years.\n\nYou see, 10 years ago today my brother was in the last 24hours of his life. He died in the late night on November 29th, 2010. The last time I saw him alive was at Thanksgiving. The holidays are a rough time for myself and my family.  \n\nToday, I am 122 days off drugs and doing much better, while I do miss my brother, I\u2019m happy and I\u2019m sharing my story, because I want to show others that, no matter how painful your situation is, you can and will get through it all. I honor my brother's memory by not using and working hard for my recovery. I overcame the hardest thing to ever happen to me. It\u2019s all about perseverance and taking it one step at a time. It sound cliche but it is true that every moment is precious. \n\nTime doesn\u2019t heal all wounds. It only allows you a chance to develop better coping mechanisms. Over the years my tools to handle the grief have improved dramatically despite the fact that my grief will always be incredibly painful.","400":"This past week I was hospitalized for pancreatitis. I don't know how I did it without opiates, but I did. After lengthy discussions with my sponsor, doctors, and family we all decided low dose ketamine and a solid amount of Benadryl to sedate me throughout the process was the way to go. It sorta worked. I cannot believe I did it without the opiates or without benzos because that shit was very anxiety inducing.\n\nThe problem is I'm in the aftermath of my hospitalization and beginning to process what I just went through. I keep playing the tape through and as a result my brain keeps trying to justify using. I'm even slightly annoyed with myself for not taking anything in the hospital because I keep telling myself, \"you would've been justified!\" I get the physical addiction, but holy shit the way opiates have hijacked my brain is incredible. Here I am with 110 days clean and all I want to do is use after fighting tooth and nail to NOT use.\n\nWHAT IS THIS SORCERY!?\n\nAlso if anyone has any tips on how to combat Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome - it would be greatly appreciated. I need more tools in my toolbox so far I've got \"call my sponsor,\" \"text 5-10 friends,\" \"do step work,\" \"read from the basic text,\" and \"try to meditate.\" Any other suggestions are warmly welcomed.","401":"I recently celebrated 90 days of clean time. Well, today my brain decided to fuck with me a whole bunch. My disease was talking to me: \n\n&gt;\"Imagine how good the painkillers would work right now! You wouldn't need a lot! AND YOU HAVE MONEY TO GET THEM!!!\"\n\nSo all day I've been telling that thought to come back later. Like a boomerang it kept circling back into my head. So INSTEAD of picking up I went ahead and texted a few people including my sponsor. Then, I started working on my step work when my sponsor texted back. We made a small plan for me to go for a walk, listen to music, come home, take a hot bath and have some ice cream after.\n\nOf course, I don't ever listen 100% so I got dressed went outside and instead of listening to music I called her. I also decided not to do a hot bath or ice cream. Instead I decided to walk to 7\/11 to get snacks. I ended up with Orange Juice, a PushPop, and Salt&amp;Vinegar Chips instead of dope.\n\nGot home safe and sound, and am seriously lowkey proud of me right now.","402":"Hi Reddit. For those that don't know me my name is Dori. I joined [r\/opiates](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/) eight years ago. I am definitely an addict and have dealt with many struggles. Today I am cleaned up and we'll get there. For right now though this is about my cousin's and her memory.\n\nI'll never forget 5 years ago today. I was away from home, shooting my prescription opiates through my feeding tube and lounging on the couch because, that's what I did every single day. That morning I had posted to my cousins Facebook page with a picture of Kristen Stuart. Apparently some stupid Facebook quiz told me that I looked like her and because my cousin and I looked a lot alike I tagged her in that post.\n\nA few hours later, I'm on a skype call with my best friend. We've known each other since childhood. So, as we're chitchatting she asks, \"Who is \\[cousin\\]?\" &amp; I respond with \"Oh, that's \\[cousin\\] she's amazing! We reconnected recently.\" She asks if I'd been to her facebook page recently and I tell her I was there that morning when I posted the Kristen Stuart photo and as I'm telling my best friend this I pull up my cousin's page because I know something was up.\n\nI was not prepared for what I found.\n\nI found condolences, RIP posts, and \"is this a joke?!\" posts all over my cousin's Facebook. Immediately, I freak out, I hang up on my best friend to make calls as my brain is trying to process this information. I want to call my aunt ASAP. I decide against it. I call up my dad who is overseas. It's the middle of the night for him and I leave a horrific voicemail of me freaking out. I call my mom who lived a state away and she tells me it's true &amp; she's 3 hours away from me. She was driving out to me to tell me the news in person.\n\nThat comforted me a lot despite finding out on Facebook of all things. It also helped that I was live with my best friend, because she's seen some shit with me and is an amazing person.\n\nThere's more to that day, but in the days following I had found out my cousin relapsed on heroin. In the months following we found out that she had died from a fentanyl overdose. My cousin struggled with heroin for most of her life. She died in her late-20s.\n\nA few months before my cousin's death I was in my hometown and my cousin asked me if I wanted to support her and go to an NA meeting with her. I had declined. I thought it would be weird for me because I \"needed\" pain medication for my chronic pain. This is a decision I regret every single day.\n\nMy aunt had outlived her only two children. Her son had passed two years prior to a diabetes complication. Seeing her pain motivated me to clean up my life. Today, I walk the exact same rooms of narcotics anonymous that my cousin walked in my original hometown.\n\nI didn't get there right away though. It wasn't until three long years after my cousins death that I attended my first meeting. From there, I'd like to say the path to recovery was beautiful, but that's simply not the truth. I struggled and even after entering the rooms I had many setbacks, relapses, temper tantrums, &amp; caught many cases of the \"fuckits.\" before my most recent relapse 57 days ago.\n\nI'm coming up on 60 days clean and this time I'm hopeful it's going to stick, because for the first time ever the pain and misery of using has outweighed the temporary relief it gives me. Some recovering addicts in the rooms knew my cousin too. I've started to embrace that and now it has become a blessing for me because they have experience with someone who was genetically like me. They've guided me and help me immensely. I've been able to learn from my cousin and grow as a result.\n\nThat in my opinion is the best way to honor my cousin's memory.\n\nI share this story with you all today, because even though it's horrific and sad, there's hope to it and I just hope that someone here gets something out of this story. I don't post often anymore, but I still lurk around and if no one has said it to you today, active addiction or not, let me tell you that I love you just the way you are.","403":"Hey guys, I love you all. &amp; I'm thinking of deleting Dori. I've gotten a huge opportunity in my life right now and there's a few things at play:\n\n1. Regardless my social media is going on lockdown within the next year. I have a stalker that gets out of prison within the year after serving a 12-year sentence.\n2. I have an amazing opportunity to work with some big names in the entertainment industry on a human level. I found a place of healing. I'm extremely excited about it. I wish I could say more.\n3. I've outgrown narcotics. Those close to me know this. They know my struggles, and they see a difference. I can commitment myself to 5 years of sobriety starting 11 days ago.\n4. I'm taking a path to getting a potential book deal. I'm very hesitant about this. It'd be a book about the loss of my younger brother. I'm writing currently, but I've signed no contracts and want to see where it could go and if I even WANT to share.\n5. I'm finding myself less able to share things on here and just am not relating to many. It's rough. These forums have been a safe space for me.\n\nSo, ultimately, I know the Dori in me will never go away. I just don't know.","404":"Tonight I'm 4 days clean from oxycodone. It's not my first rodeo. I've done it a few times voluntarily since 2017. I'm hoping I took my last recreational dose Friday for good. Despite what I was prepared for the withdrawals weren't anywhere near difficult. A mix of Lyrica, Clonidine, &amp; Xanax + Tylenol, Ibuprofen, Imodium, and Anti-Nausea meds. Slept through most of Saturday and most of Sunday. I felt ill. However, come bed time on Sunday my only serious problem seemed to be my restless leg. \n\nRegardless I slept well enough to feel like a new person.\n\nTuesday, today, though, well that's where Miss Karma showed up. For those that know my story, part of the reason I stopped going to Narcotics Anonymous had to do with two failed sponsorships and increasing legitimate physical pain. I haven't been into an NA room since my 1 year this past October.\n\n&gt;I felt betrayed, angry, and simply defeated by the fact that my body was out of my control. The speech I gave on my October 14th, was designed to give a newcomer hope. It was made to fit the mold, tell everyone how WELL I was doing.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;All I wanted to really do though, was call bullshit. Call bullshit on my legitimacy, call bullshit about not being scared, call bullshit on my insecurities and ego. I wanted to let the room know I was never supposed to be there in the first place. So why was I?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;I was the one who strictly went by, \"*best way to never get addicted is to never try*.\" I never sought Marijuana out, illegal drugs? WHAT THE FUCK was that!? I didn't even know my closest blood cousin, because who wants to associate with a heroin addict? Her disease haunted her from the time she was 16. She was 29 upon death. \n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;She walked these EXACT rooms. She's been in the same room years prior that I was standing in. What good did it do her? How many birthdays did she celebrate before it killed her? I had reconnected with her when she was in these rooms and I realize she was living the same unhappy lie I was living.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;Conforming to what every expects a *good* addict to do. Get your steps done, tell your sponsor EVERYTHING, be happy, be grateful, count your blessings, have quality problems, one day at a time.  you have to want it, think about the similarities not the differences. It works if you work it. \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;Then think about my brother. Who despite never hanging with my cousin died of an heroin dose of his own. An addiction we didn't know he had. It was a foreign to me. I went to a Dual Diagnosis Facility for DEPRESSION and suicidality almost a year after his death. Because if my brother can die, twisted enough, \"anything you can do I can do better,\" disturbing sibling rivalry   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;The drug counselor was baffled my naivety, \"so a \\[blank city\\] girl?\" I told him it was the land of \\[what we're known for\\] looking back now he was trying to get me to talk drugs, \"youre brother died of heroin...how do you cope?\" my response, \"Well, I'm here aren't, I.\" looking back he was looking for me to say, \"drugs,\" I wouldn't know Heroin from Marijuana from prescription pills if he put them in front of me.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;So, how do I get here. How am I detoxing for the countless time in the last 3 years. Surely therapy helped? Would I have just stayed away?  kept saying no? The chilling answer is:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**No.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I got ill. Chronically ill. An illness, an illness that impacts me for the rest of my life. An illness that has caused countless ER visits and hospitalizations. Not deadly, just a huge PHYSICALLY PAINFUL nuisance. Was that all that was going on though? No. I had a dead brother who died of virtually the same thing the hospital put into my veins, I struggled, and shamed myself for needing it and then...\n\n&gt;....well I gave up and gave in. \n\n\n\nSo, here we are 4 days clean and I'm at the supermarket at an ungodly hour on My Way To Work which is something I RARELY do. I wanted to get a thing of creamer for my keurig I got going here at my desk and figure the ladies in events will let me store the creamer in their mini fridge vs. the main one - I digress.\n\nI stop and grab a naked juice as well and go over to the only cashier there that's opened.\n\nI have two items this woman has about 5 iced tea drinks and few other random things. She says good morning out of nowhere &amp; I'm all like oh morning and she looks at me, at first I figure she's gonna let me go ahead since I have two items. Interestingly enough, it's Her. \\[first sponsor\\]'s sponsor. I never had any hard feelings to her. Ever. She's the first person I've seen outside of NA. \n\nSince I last went on October 14th.\n\nand out of no where she reaches in for a hug and we have this big hug in the middle of the check out. like a real hug. the kinda hug that means something. haven't seen her since I stopped going to NA. Even deleted her number out of my phone so I wouldn't accidentally text her or first sponsor or anything.\n\nI gave her the 3-5 minute rundown, that my physicians put me back on stuff, the extra trouble with my neck, the fact that I'm currently 4\/5 days off of everything as of today - how odd - miss karma at work -- and finally, the good stuff too, still engaged to be married soon, and just did the engagement pictures. I added her number back to my phone - just in case. \n\n&amp; that's where the story ends for now.","405":"I'm withdrawing from opiates. Both a 45mg per day max of oxycodone and a 5g of heroin. That lasted me an entire month.  \n\nYesterday I was in extreme pain from it and my legs wouldn't stop being restless. It was awful so I opted to knock myself out with lyrica and xanax. It was helpful. I slept the day away only waking up for  30minutes here and there. \n\nIt continued through the night and so I dosed with clonidine. That helped but was doing jack shit. So I started with the lope. I think I took rough 15mg (not all at once) of lope last night. This morning ... day 2 when i was expecting it to be the worst.... I feel 80\u066a better. \n\nWtf.

I was going to use that money to buy comfort meds but now that's out of the picture. I don't know I'm really hurting physically and mentally right now.

I've even ventured down the Heroin route because my tolerance is so fucked. I want to get up and thrive. It's not about my next high or not feeling sick, it's about living. I can't live when I'm dying from addiction. \n\nI have wrestled over that the last few years wanting to be clean and going back and forth. Especially with my pain problems. It's a hell of a battle. I guess for me it has gotten worse. I still hold out hope that it can get better. \n\nRight now I'm blessed with an incredible job. I'm getting married. I'm living with my fianc\u00e9. I have a life. A life that I built in my sobriety. A life that I am afraid I am going to destroy with my current relapse.\n\nI believe I'm a ticking time bomb. I need to suffer through it and just pull the band aid off. I seem to be hopeless at tapering and I'm finding myself thinking Heroin is an acceptable answer. ^(hint: Heroin is NEVER the answer)\n\nI want my doctor to prescribe me comfort meds and let me just withdraw over a weeks time and just tell work it is the flu. The problem is that would mean admitting to the truth. The truth about my addiction. \n\nWhen I DO have a chronic pain problem that will need to be medicated in the future. I NEVER want to be in a situation where if required I'm denied reasonable painkillers. I've been there a few times and it is immensely traumatic.\n\nOne thing that may work and that I'm considering is to source the comfort medications through illicit means and rip the band aid off myself and do it on my own. That would give me the freedom to continue getting painkillers from my doctor that I could store away for those times when I legitimately need them. \n\nThe good news in all of this is I have not been to the ER since November. While that may seem like a short amount of time, I've been averaging a monthly ER visit in the last few yeas with actual hospitalizations roughly 4-6 times a year. So, I'm proud of myself for that. \n\nAnyway, I just felt a need to get my thoughts out of my head. Thanks for listening.","408":"Despite being a drug addict for 7 years I was always able to avoid Heroin. Until now. It used to always be that oxycodone, opana, dilaudid - well anything but heroin could carry my addiction. Until now, I currently need 160mg of oxycodone to feel well. With a habit that big it is financially unsustainable. So, I've moved to heroin. I really just want off of it all. I keep telling myself I'll be able to taper the H. But that's probably horseshit. Fuck me. Fuck me. Fuck me.\n\nEdit #1: Thanks for the love. I'm starting to think I might be better off going through withdrawal and risking my job. After all, my health is most important at the end of the day.","409":"OK so, today was gonna be sweet. I was going to lounge around the house and then go out to dinner with my cousin, parents and fiance.  It was gonna be great. \n\nUntil I felt super constipated. SO, So much pain. No matter what I did, nothing happened. I was pissed off and remember my GI doctor gave me samples of a medication on Friday that I was supposed to take daily. I skipped it Saturday because I'm always weary about new medications and didn't want any problems at the bridal shop.\n\nTomorrow I have work. I don't need anything strange happening there. That'd not be good. So, I took it today. Sunday. Just to get a feel for how it worked. My idea of it was that it may make me need to use the restroom because the Relistor makes you do that. Relistor is for opioid induced constipation. OK fair enough.\n\nWithin 20 minutes I'm itchy and little bumps are showing up. I wait 5 minutes to see if I'm hallucinating or if something bizarre is happening. So, then I confirm it's  severe I take 50mg of Benadryl and dial 911. By this time I massive red welts all over my arms, chest, and legs. 911 has me on FUCKING HOLD and I start panicking. I text my fiance and mom that if I don't respond and let them know paramedics where there or whatever, to dial 911 as well. Meanwhile I finally got through and the dispatcher stayed on the phone with me.\n\nParamedics show up just as the Benadryl starts to take affect still though, they take one single look at it and say, \"you're coming with us.\" I blow out the candles, snag my phone throw on fuzzy boots and get loaded up into the ambulance. I don't even lock my apartment.\n\nThey insist on taking me to the nearest hospital. 'cuz well allergic reactions can be deadly and I looked pretty awful. Kinda wish I took a photo but I was thinking in the moment and that didn't involve selfies of my arms, legs, and chest area at all. Priorities, ya know? \n\nER kept me for about an hour after administering some oral medications and then sent me home with a script of steroids to be safe. So, now, here's the next problem. Although I've never tried meth I react to steroids as if I'm fucking on it. You can probably tell by how long this is getting and stuff that I'm amped up. \n\nNow, I just have to be really careful for the next week or so and avoid annoying people\/getting emotional and into fights because there's been massive breakdowns for me as a result of the steroids. Breakdowns to the point that I'm pretty sure some Chinese tourist has video of 16 year old me going full meltdown mode on Hollywood Blvd throwing a toddler style fit over concert tickets (I forgot who) and to the point where the homeless are yelling that they need to shut me up.\n\nI'll only use them if I ABSOLUTELY have to. This is one of those times. I need to be so careful now, and stay away from  the drama.","410":"The day seemed to go smoothly. I spent a few hours on campus, dropped off the final and skipped out on class. I remember being confronted by the teacher\u2019s assistant, \u201cWhy are you leaving early?\u201d  he barked at my friend and I as we attempted to leave the 300-student lecture hall. He protested to me, lecturing me that family, places to be, and things to do would always be there. That I should seize hold of my education and opportunity ahead of me.\n\nAt that moment I agreed with him, and to be honest, I was just being a terrible student. It was the end of the term, I was having a good day and I didn\u2019t feel like sitting through the professor\u2019s last lecture. It was optional and the class had been a complete bore.\n\nAs I grabbed the bus back into my building I was done with fall term officially. I smiled to myself as I walked home from the bus stop. I noticed my phone had a voicemail. Short and sweet it struck fear into my heart:\n\n\u201cHey Dori\\_88, it is Daddy. Call me\u2014we need to talk.\u201d\n\nI called him back right away. The phone rang once, and he answered. We talked, and he said that him and mom were coming right over, that there was something to discuss\u2014we needed to have a family meeting right a way. They were on their way to my apartment.\n\nIt was strange. Why would we need to meet? Now? What for? I flew into a mode of panic. The apartment was a mess. \u201cJust get the place cleaned\u2014think later.\u201d  I don\u2019t know why I felt this way. Perhaps it was something in my father's tone that gave him away or a sixth sense of sorts. I acted out of fear and took 20 minutes to get the kitchen, bedroom area, and living area fully organized and done. My parents should have been arriving at any minute.\n\nYet they weren\u2019t there. Five long minutes passed and I racked my brain, \u201cThis isn\u2019t good,\u201d I thought to myself, as I peeked out the front window to look for them pulling up. They weren\u2019t there, and I paced.\n\n\u201cWell, think!\u201d I remember telling myself harshly. I remember analyzing it. \u201cDad called me, not mom. He said Daddy. Something\u2019s wrong, his tone was off. My great grandmother, she\u2019s 93 perhaps something horrible has happened to her? But that\u2019s on Mom\u2019s side, why wouldn\u2019t mom call me about that?\u201d I wondered, \u201cWell, wait, the dog\u2019s been sick. We know we have to put him down soon. Maybe he needs to be put down. Maybe the vet called.\u201d\n\n\u201c\\[My Brother\\] is going to freak out. I wonder if he\u2019s coming with mom and dad. They should be in the car by now. It\u2019s been thirty minutes, they should\u2019ve been here by now. They don\u2019t live that far away. Maybe I should call the house and see if \\[My Brother\\] answers, they\u2019re probably in the car alone without him and he\u2019s at home and already knows.\u201d\n\nIt was at that moment I was paralyzed with fear. I went to dial the house number but could not. I did not want to confirm the next thought I had. \u201cWhat if \\[My Brother\\] doesn\u2019t answer? What if something\u2019s happened to him?\u201d\n\nAnd then it struck me, ten minutes before my parents arrived. Ten minutes before I knew anything had happened, I feared the worst. \u201cWhat if \\[Brother\\] got into trouble\u2014what if he\u2019s dead?\u201d And like a mantra I repeated over and over again, out loud, \u201cPlease let it be the dog. Please let it be the dog. Don\u2019t let it be \\[Brother\\], not \\[Brother\\].\u201d\n\nI saw my parents pull up through the window. Before I knew it they were at my door, and as I opened the door before they could even fully ring the bell because I was right on the other end, waiting, I saw my mother\u2019s face, a picture of distress, an expression that is the definition of pure anguish, and without words I reached out to hug her, knowing something was horribly amiss. But before I could dive in for that hug, dad touched my shoulder and simply said, \u201c\\[Brother's\\] dead.\u201d I crumpled to the ground in what was a collapse in tears of incomprehensible grief.\n\nThat was nine short, yet long years ago.  He died of a heroin overdose. I miss him every day.\n\n***Be safe fam. You ARE loved.***","411":"On Sunday, I had an MRI on my neck to check some things. Monday my head was killing me. Not only that I was having extreme pain down my left arm. While I knew it wasn't a heart attack, I still went to the ER because it was painful. So, very painful. \n\nAt the ER I found out I have two bulging discs in my neck right below my metal plate from spinal surgery in 2016. Well, needless to say the ER awful. More so than usual. Due to being on the Subutex they \"couldn't\" and wouldn't give me any narcotics to help.\n\nThe pain was agonizing. So, instead they gave me was nausea meds, benadyl, toradol. That did nothing for me. Then, they decided to give me an IV steroid. Seconds after they administrated it, my ass started to burn. I was so shocked, turned to the nurse, and was like, \"OH GOD MY BUTTHOLE IS ON FIRE!\"  It quickly migrated to my crotch so between my stomach, arm and asshole I was in more pain than I could handle. They ended up sedating with valium, more benadryl, and a haladol So, that I could sleep and hopefully wake up to less pain.\n\nIt was bad.\n\nAfter that experience, I went to my doctors the next day. This is the one that was offering the Fentanyl. The ER visited really spooked me. I never want to end up in a situation where treating my pain is impossible. It was so traumatizing. Never again.I ended up walking out of there with a plan of action and oxycodone. My personal plan is to use the oxycodone until they can do neck injections to help with my neck pain. After that, I plan to reevaluate. I ultimately do not want to be on it for more than 3 months.\n\nPain is such a difficult thing to handle. I wouldn't wish it on anyone. Anyway, that's the latest. I'm no longer clean.","412":"You all have known me for a good few years. Some of you have even watched as I grew up on this subreddit. You saw me at my worst in terms of pain and addiction and you've seen me at my best in supposed recovery.\u00a0\n\nThe truth of the matter is I sit day to day at a solid 6 painscore. Daily. I'm exhausted by it and run down from it. Yet, I still put on a smile of sorts. I still get up. I still go to work. I still live a fulfilling life. At the same time, I've also cut down on Narcotics Anonymous. I wasn't able to relate as much as I would've liked and kept getting dropped by sponsors.\u00a0\n\n\nI don't think the answer for me is that program and neither is a pill.\n\n\nI'm currently on Buprenorphine.\n\n\nToday, I went in for an appointment for a pain management doctor that specializes in spinal problems. My neck has been getting worse and worse over time. I've had 2 surgeries on it and my spinal team is located a state away so I've been wanting to get a local team anyway.\n\n\nAs I talked to this doctor and he did some simple physical test he quickly realized I had more pain going on than I was letting on. He asked about my medication. I explained how I've been doing an unorthodox thing of being on subutex and taking 15mg oxycodone for pain relief when I flare.\u00a0\n\n\nHe wasn't too surprised, but as I explained that the bupe is stable and safe, it doesn't help the pain at all. I only take enough to not be in withdrawals and regretted getting on it. That I'd rather be on nothing than the bupe.\n\n\nThis doctor recommended I try fentanyl patches. He had read a study recently where they were saying fentanyl patches could help a ton that they were proven to be the new standard for gut issues and with my coexisting spinal problems I was a good candidate for it.\u00a0\n\n\nNow, I've been on fent patches before. They worked great ...\u00a0 until I got greedy and wanted to be on oxymorphone so I dropped the fentanyl patches for that. I wonder if I had stayed with the patches how things would've turned out....\u00a0\n\n\nIDK. Here is a doctor in the middle of an opioid crisis willing to put that aside and treat me like a human and potentially get my pain under control. Or at least try too. He's also licensed for the bupe so he said if things weren't working he could always switch me back to where I am now.\n\n\nWhile I don't think this is the complete answer, I do feel strongly that I'd like to give it a go. I have a lot of hesitation about this though. Ugh. I have no idea where I'm going with this. Just trying to talk it through in my brain and possibly get feedback.","413":"When I made decision to get clean in November of 2017, all I wanted was to not be dope sick. I had run out of money and had no more drugs. I decided then and there I would tough it out. Since then have there been relapses? Yes. Am I clean to the standards of NA? Absolutely not. I still smoke weed for pain and in the last year I've been put on subutex. The important question is:\n\n**Am I happy? 100% Absolutely!**\n\nThe night that I decided to be clean was the first positive step of many. From there I moved out of my parents, got a job, got engaged, and have been living an amazing life. I've been just amazed at how awesome my life has been. Could it get any better? Any better at all?\n\n**Yes, yes it can. Today I got a $5 raise.**\n\nThe biggest thing I've learned in these last few years is that I am worth something. I cannot describe how depressed I've been. Between my physical problems, mental health, and addiction, I thought I was meant to just survive. Now, I am thriving. Who knew it was possible?","414":"Wow. I cannot believe it Here we are. It's my 1 year 'birthday,'  Coincidentally, I have the day off work because it's Sukkot, a Jewish Holiday, and I work for a religious-based company. I actually have today and Tuesday off. Same thing for next week too. Which, in my opinion, is awesome. \n\nSo, originally, I was planning on hitting up a meeting I like and taking a cake there, but in all honesty, I've had such a hard time with Narcotics Anonymous that I wasn't feeling it. \n\nToday, was pretty lackluster, but in a good way. Ya know? A buddy of mine promised not to use or relapse today or anytime because it would insult me to do that on my one year or near it in their opinion. I agree and that alone makes me feel really good. \n\nIn some ways, I feel like I've accomplished jackshit because I'm on Subutex, and sometimes do need narcotics because of my pain problems with my health and all. \n\nHowever, when you look at the reality of it, I moved out of my damned parent's house, I'm engaged! I've got a job, and my finances are getting better. To me being clean is more about the transformation of your life than the actual drug. I do see how cutting the drug out helped me transform my world too.\n\nI don't know I'm having a lot of random thoughts and just wanted to share. XOXO. Stay beautiful fam.","415":"I'd really like to know why. I don't get it. We are the outcasts of society. Many people think we're all junkie scum. That we deserve to die. People believe we are the cause of our addiction. People think we are thieves. People think we are liars. People think we belong in prison. \n\nYet, we feel this need to pass that same type of hate onto each other. Why?\n\nI've been a victim of bullying on this subreddit as well. People used to say nasty things to me and about me all the time. To this day I get downvoted no matter what by at least 1 person. \n\n... &amp; of course Spinderella is in the hot seat and she doesn't even have the ability to defend herself. It's extremely dishearting.\n\nI know users who have left this subreddit entirely because they were harassed here. \n\nYou can disagree or hold an opinion without being nasty, aggressive, or hateful in your comments.\n\nTry reading your comments aloud before posting them. It's easy to forget that there are humans behind every username here. \n\n# Now, let's be nicer to each other. We all deserve respect.","416":"I'm approaching my 1-year clean birthday and I don't think I'm going to go to Narcotics Anonymous and take a cake for it. \n\nI feel really conflicted about Narcotics Anonymous. I've had two awful experiences with sponsors in this past year. I felt really hurt by it. Everyone is telling me to move on and find someone new, but I'm so freaked out about getting into another bad situation that it just isn't worth it for me.  \n\nIt's not like I didn't give NA a chance either. I kept with it for over a year, accepted relapses, and worked the program as best I could despite my horrible issues with sponsorship. \n\nWhat I've found\/learned for myself is that Narcotics Anonymous is a suggestion. It is not a MUST for sobriety. I think using Narcotics Anonymous in conjunction with things like medication, therapy, and positive activities is the key to getting clean. For me following a rigid all or nothing \/ fail or pass type of system does more harm than good.\n\nSo October 14th, 2019 marks my 1 year consecutive anniversary and November 23rd, 2017 marks the date I decided to change my life. Both of those dates are so meaningful to me. I just wanted to share.","417":"I just felt like making a check in\/how are you doing post. Sometimes life can be hectic. There will always be stressors. Some days will be better than other and at the end of the day - you are who you are. So I want to know how are you doing today? Are you withdrawing? Copping? Grieving? Clean? Happy? Sad? What about angry? \n\nI'm asking how are you and want your genuine answer. \n\nAs for me, I'm doing well. Down to 1.50mg of subutex. I see my suboxone doctor tomorrow. Gonna get 2mg pills to make the taper easier. I haven't been to the hospital since early july and its mid September now! I cannot believe it. That much time out of the hospital is unheard of.  I have been pretty exhausted. So I've been handling that as I best I can. I also have stopped attending narcotics Anonymous. It helped a lot when I first started, but after that - it just wasn't for me  Overall, things are genuinely going well for a change.","418":"My mother did a fantastic job of tearing me down earlier today.

However, other than that it went fine in my eyes.\n\nI call my parents this morning and the first thing my dad says, \"what were you on last night? You were really fucked up!\" I was very confused and started rattling off my normal medications. Dad cuts me off and asked if I took too many opiates or was smoking weed. I told him I could guarantee I was clean and if he'd like I'd come by and do a urine test for him. \n\nIt was an empty treat and my dad backed off a little bit after that. \n\nWhat was really annoying is I was doing the opposite of being on anything, I was tapering my Subutex script.

It's so bad that I'm considering asking my doctor about getting tested for narcolepsy. It's so bad, that I went to an NA meeting 100% clean and sober and was nodding off.

If you live outside of the USA and were NOT affected and cannot collect, *don't be sad*, just know your social security number and\/or **private details aren't compromised and that's a lot better.**\n\n# You are all very welcome.","427":"Whelp, between all my physical health struggles and ever since my feeding tube was removed - I've gained 70lbs in 2 years making me 70lbs overweight. It's disgusting. It's disturbing to me. \n\nI really don't think I eat a whole heck of a lot seeing as I'm nauseated most days. I eat in small increments, my stomach can't handle more. I've been throughly elevated and aside from a minor autoimmune disorder and my existing pancreatic condition there is no good reason for me to be gaining all this weight. Luckily I've plateaued  at my current weight and I fluctuate 8-10 pounds from morning to night. \n\nI know this isn't really opiate related, but you guys are my fam and I'm in need of serious help. I don't even know where to start diet wise. So, I've been thinking of ways I could try to get exercise. However when it takes a whole hour to burn 250 calories - that's pretty discouraging for me. \n\nAnyway, any encouragement, advice or spot to start would be amazing. I'm thinking of buying a swim cap\/googles and going swimming at my friend's condo. She lives a mile from me, I could walk there swim for 30-60 minutes and then walk back home. We've talked about doing this regularly after work. Then on days I'm not swimming I could potentially work on a couch to 5K program.\n\nAs for food, I'm just so lost. I can't eat a lot of fat or veggies because of my digestive system. Fruits work as does carbohydrates. The problem with that is that's a really high sugar diet. My GP prescribed me Adderall and said it might help. I haven't filled the script because it concerns me to take something else that I could potentially get addicted to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHELP!","428":"I'm 9 months clean. And I get to spend it the hospital hooked up to the same drugs that turned me into an addict in the first place. Its concerning because I have no one to talk to about it seeing as my sponsor has ditched me. I do know its necessary to treat myself with kindness and take the opioids as directed by the hospital. Because without them the healing process would be a grueling one.  Since I've been here I've been on meds every 4hours for the lat 3days. Plus infusions of ketamine for 2 days. I need to trust myself md realize that I need to treat the pain properly because otherwise I wont heal and I'm a human being before I am an addict. I feel like due to my situation I work a Narcotics Anonymous program through the times of illness literature.","429":"I'm having trouble sleeping. Anyone else around to just chat with? Xo.

I\u2019ve been on methadone for like 9 months. Clean just as long. I\u2019ve been really struggling lately and sure enough I\u2019m at my dudes house picking up a bag. \n\nBut I had a question. If I have been doing well at the clinic will they take away my take homes? I\u2019m on phase 2 which means I get 3 bottles on Thursday and I\u2019m set to phase up in a few weeks. \n\nWill a relapse take away my bottles?","1":"I was just served by a debt collector today. \n\nThankfully I already had a plan to file bankruptcy. \n\nOf course even tho I\u2019m clean and I\u2019m doing okay, I can barely afford to eat, so my mom is lending me the money to file. \n\nMan, I finally get my shit together and the universe still likes kicking me in the balls. \n\nHas anyone else here ever filled for bankruptcy after getting clean??","2":"I\u2019ve been getting crazy cravings lately. I don\u2019t know what it is. I\u2019ve been on 105mg of methadone since July 20th and haven\u2019t really wanted to use much. But lately... I\u2019ve been thinking about it. \n\nMy life isn\u2019t great by any means. BUT I\u2019m not homeless or waking up sick. \n\nThere have been a few posts in a FB support group for users who\u2019ve relapsed after years clean. \n\nIdk. I just rented Ben Is Back on amazon because I have the money to do shit like that again lol a shame wow it was awesome. \n\nOh and yesterday was my 29th birthday. ","3":"So I\u2019ve been clean for most of the last year since rehab last winter. \n\nI\u2019m doing well, have a job, have steady income, on methadone, but that\u2019s it. \n\nI\u2019m a 28yo gay guy that\u2019s been  single for basically ever... and I\u2019m afraid my life isn\u2019t going to get much better than this. \n\nDating as a gay guy is already hard as it is, and for the most part people are really encouraging about my recovery (I\u2019m always upfront about recovery before we even go on a date)\n\nBut I have to deal with the rejection without using, and I\u2019ve been rejected SO much that it\u2019s not even a reason to use. \n\nIf this is all my life, I don\u2019t know what the point of getting clean was. ","4":"Yesterday I ran into an old dealer after a few years. He\u2019s now working full time, has a hot girlfriend, and he just bought  a fucking house. \n\nI haven\u2019t been clean as long as him but I only make $10\/hr part time, I can\u2019t afford to date, and I\u2019m never going to make enough to buy a house.  \n\nPeople are always like LIFE IS AMAZING SOBER. \n\nWell fuck you. No it\u2019s not. The least shitty part of my day is taking my methadone because of the buzz. Other than that I sleep for as long as I can. \n\nThis is simply how my life is going to be no matter how much clean time I get. I\u2019m not going to wake up one day to a raise. Not happening. \n\nThis is just me, isn\u2019t it?","5":"Does anyone else struggle with being clean sometimes?\n\nGreat jobs tend to fall into my lap, and the most recent is a job at Facebook HQ, doing \u201canything I want\u201d they said. But I\u2019m nervous because if I get my dream job, start making 6 figures, and I\u2019m lonely as hell... that\u2019s a recipe for disaster. I haven\u2019t told Facebook yes or no yet. \n\nThe other issue is that my ex lives within driving distance of Palo Alto, and I\u2019m still madly in love with him and I always will be, so I\u2019ll be tempted to make a fool of myself because he made it clear it was over. \n\n\n","6":"I have a very marketable career,  but I keep fucking it up. I\u2019m so ready for the next shot to take me out. \n\nNothing it criticism for how so..? Idk. Not even really any party ","7":"Hey so I recently got on methadone and I was wondering if drug tests (rapid) can tell the difference between methadone and other opiates?\n\nLike, if I popped for opiates would that be expected because I\u2019m on methadone, and if I were to relapse,the rapid tests wouldn\u2019t know the difference?\n\nThanks. ","8":"So I found a thread in a huge FB group (you've probably seen it -- they ban you for mentioning Kratom, and hate harm reduction)\n\nThis woman, who's OBVIOUSLY never used before, tried to tell us all what caused endocarditis...\n\n\" endocarditis is when the tiny fibers of cotton eventually clog the valve of the heart and causes and infection that can lead to needing a heart valve replacement, biological or mechanical. Think of your drain getting clogged with hair.\"\n\nI tried to tell her that's VERY WRONG. and she replied, \"I respectfully disagree\"\n\nBITCH YOU CANT DISAGREE WITH SCIENCE.","9":"I've now had 3 shots, most recently last Thursday, but last Monday I picked up a bag... roughly 25 days after my 2nd shot. \n\nAccording to science all anecdotal reports, I should've felt NOTHING. Especially with the .2 shot I did.\n\nBut no, I got higher than I've been in 5 years. If I broke thru, I have no idea how.\n\nNaltrexone DOES lower opiate tolerance, which explains why I was puking my brains out but it doesn't explain why it didn't block the shot.\n\nI also did some on Sunday... 3 days after shot #3 and while I didn't feel anything super strong, I did get a nice mood boost, and a little of the warm tingles.\n\nThere's also something else worth considering ... Since I did some on that Monday, and my shot was on Thursday, I should've popped for dope at the doctor, but my UA was 100% clean. From the results I saw, it doesnt look like they test for fent or its analogues... In fact the only opiate on the list is morphine.\n\nSo maybe I got a super potent fent analogue that cuts through naltrexone like butter?\n\nWhat do you guys think?","10":"So 3 days ago I posted about how awesome my life was. Well, apparently a lot can happen in 3 days.\n\nSo I\u2019m 1200 miles from home until next Tuesday with my boyfriend, right? Well last night he basically called it off. While I\u2019m 1200 miles away from home.\n\nHe said he\u2019s not ready for a guy (we\u2019re gay) in his life at this point and he thought he was. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s learning more about himself, but I wished it wouldn\u2019t have been at my expense. I didn\u2019t see this coming a million miles away. I can\u2019t help but laugh because I should be so used to shit like this happening to me, but it always blindsides me. Maybe I should actually listen when I tell myself to not get involved. Dating is such a waste of time lol\n\nI got really drunk last night and a friend of his held me while I cried. This is why I don\u2019t drink, I embarrass myself.\n\nHad I not been on the shot, getting high would be the first thing on my mind. And honestly, I\u2019m half tempted to see if I can break through the shot. Yeah I know the risks, but I\u2019m past the point of caring.\n\nI gues whenever your life looks perfect, and its too good to be true? It probably is.","11":"I\u2019m still alive and still clean. 136 days to be exact. \n\nOn Friday I graduated from my halfway house, moved into a new apartment, flew to somewhere warm for 10 days to be with my boyfriend, AND as I was waiting for the plane I got a call from a company i interviewed at saying they\u2019re offering me a job. \n\nI think this tI\u2019ve it\u2019s gonna stick. Hopefully. I\u2019m on Vivitrol this time and not subs. \n\nI hope you\u2019re all well. This place has been there for me during all my crazy ups and downs and I wanted to share how well I\u2019m doing. \n\n\u2764\ufe0f","12":"Hey everyone! I\u2019m doing the recovery thing again. I\u2019m back up to 77 days. \n\nI\u2019m on naltrexone now instead of subs. It handles my cravings easily 10x better. \n\nBut since I\u2019m not on a narcotic all my chronic joint pain is rushing back. It sucks. But I stand by my decision. \n\nI hope you\u2019re all well \u2764\ufe0f","13":"I slipped after like 7 months of sobriety on subs, after my state insurance was taken over by a new work insurance that my sub doc didn't take.\n\nBut that's not why I'm here. I need to talk to someone that's not my fam.\n\nRewind to August 2011, My Grandma (mom's mom) leaves my mother a NASTY voicemail out of the blue telling her what a shitty mother she is, and to leave, and never come back.\n\nThat was a gut punch. My mom was adopted, and you DONT TREAT ADOPTED KIDS OR OTHERWISE THAT WAY.\n\nAlso, my Grandma was my rock, I mean weekly phone calls for YEARS. I told her everything, vice versa. Until my mom played me the voicemail.\n\nI'm FIERCELY loyal to my mother. She's put up my with my addiction, being homeless, going to jail, there's nothing I can do to push her away. So I took my moms \"side\" and never spoke to my grandma (or grandpa, because he never once apologized for her) ever again.\n\nIt made me really said over the years, and they both recently passed between July - Sept. It was a shock.\n\nThey had a large estate, and my mom, and my brothers all assumed we were taken out of the will.\n\nDRUMROLL PLEASE....................\n\nMy aunt told us today that my brothers and I (NOT my mom) will be getting an inheritance. We're just stunned. Absolutely stunned. My little brother told me his \"heart hurts so much\" and mine does too, because we never TRIED to reconcile. I mean, I don't regret supporting my mom, she supports me daily, but taking us out of the will was never even DISCUSSED. and we cut off all contact, and NOW, getting this money means 2 people who never stopped loving us are gone, and we can't fix it.\n\nI have to stop now, because if they ask why I'm sniffling at my desk, I'll have to come up with something and I can't even think right now.\n\nWhat is a barely-sober addict like me going to do with an inheritance I really, really thought was out of the question??","14":"Hey people. heard about \/u\/timbf. that makes me so sad.\n\nJust made me miss this community of lovely people.\n\nI thought I'd just poke in an say I'm still alive, and still clean! (a few slips, but I've been mostly clean since October!)\n\nHow has everyone been??","15":"Sometimes it's really hard to be doing well when every few weeks or so I look around and see the corpses of friends, some really good friends.\n\nI woke up to see a good friend I met in rehab died in his sleep last night. Or so that's the word.\n\nHe was the sweetest person I've ever met.\n\nSometimes I hate being one of the few still standing.\n\n&lt;3 you, Ethan","16":"Heyo!\n\nMan, its' been a LONG 5 months. I've been clean since October 20th, 2016. I thought I'd miss Reddit, but I don't.\n\nI'm on 16mg of Suboxone. Working from home full-time, as a web developer, and spending time with my family.\n\nToday is my 27th birthday. This time last year, my addiction started driving my life into the ground. I ended up living in my boyfriends car for 5 months before entering treatment. Being homeless, hungry, and withdrawing is a position I NEVER want to be in again.\n\n Just the simple fact that I'm clean now, and working on my life, showed my dad he can trust me to live in his house again.\n\nMy boyfriend are no longer together, but hes better off. He has a decent job, and living with his parents almost 12 hours away.\n\nI spent 3 years high on anything I could touch, but Suboxone has given me my life back. I don't even THINK about getting high. Sure, I do miss the people sometimes, but I'm not sure I can say I miss heroin.\n\nI love you guys. \n\nWhat's happened on the sub in the last 5 months? I wanna hear from you! \n\n&lt;3 benzo","17":"I'm going to a halfway house. I missed you guys a ton.\n\nWhat's happened here since October???","18":"I got my results.\n\nI have a bed waiting for tomorrow at a program!!! I'm kinda relieved because I'd drop dirty for a few things just today... But now that I'll be in treatment, I won't have to do that shitty color wheel thing.\n\nThey called me yesterday and said there's a waiting list and I could be waiting 1-3 weeks\n\nWell, because I'm a homeless IV addict, I got the open spot today!!\n\nMy heads going a million miles an hour but I'm so thankful that I have a way out of this game. I'm so tired.\n\n I ran into my best dude the other day, and hes happy for me, hes like \"you keep in touch, I don't wanna worry about you not calling when you're clean. Losing friends that die or get clean is shitty \"\n\nI'm excited. I'm nervous. But it's a FUCKING LGBT REHAB\n\n\nI told them my sexuality has nothing to do with my sobriety, because it was never why I used.\n\nI can't have a cell phone, laptop, etc, but I can get letters!! I know there's a group that sends letters to those of us behind bars, but I would LOVE to hear from any of you. And I'll write back. Promise.\n\nIll get my info to either u\/traceyh415 u\/FashionablyFake\n\nAnd u\/Krewtan is local, so he'll even be visiting.\n\nWish me luck fam!","19":"On June 9th, I lost a really good friend. Fent, Xanax, and alcohol. A fatal combination.\n\nI thought his death would've been enough.\n\nIt wasn't.\n\nHis best friend, another friend of mine, was taken off live support on September 16th. Same combination.\n\nHe said he'd use in moderation, but with fent, and it's analogues, moderation is often fatal.\n\nIt makes me so sad. These kids just got their degrees. Not even 23.\n\nIf you use ECP, even every once in a while, please understand the danger you're in. Your tolerance is too low to save you from carfentanil. No matter what.\n\nI've seen an almost fatal overdose from snorting a small line, and that's even with frequent use. It doesn't happen immediately, but within 5 minutes, he was purple. He thought the small line he did was safe. Nothing is safe with fentanyl. No ROA. NOTHING.\n\nPlease, I beg you, stop.\n\nThe people you leave behind are left with so much guilt and sadness, you couldn't possibly understand. \n\nI only have texts and Facebook messages from my friends because they thought they were safe with snorting.\n\nI really miss my friends.\n\n\n","20":"No, not that waiting \n\nSince I was arrested, I've stayed clean, got all my court ordered shit done, and my PO is very happy.\n\nIm waiting to hear back about my chemical assessment. Known as a rule 25 in MN. Its used to decide what kind of treatment I need. Since im homeless, i really want an inpatient rehab with methadone or subs. I should find out hopefully tomorrow or Monday.\n\nI can get started on methadone the minute the assessment is approved.\n\nIll be staying with my mom for a few days, while I wait for the call.\n\nOn the plus side, ive been clean 2 weeks tomorrow.","21":"Friday night I was arrested. 5th degree possession. \n\nThank God Minnesota dropped it down to a gross misdemeanor instead of a felony as of August 1st. I'm lucky. \n\nI am still in withdrawals. \n\nIt also started Thursday when I got some with a friend. Ended up hitting him with a shot of a sub strip to save his life. \n\nThe same batch almost killed another friend after he snorted a single line. This leads me to believe that fent is everywhere here. Also,  the tar here doesn't even get me high anymore,  and only fent would raise my tolerance so high.\n\nI don't know how I'm going to comply with probation while living in a car when it's going to snow shortly. ","22":"How I went from having a successful career at 23 to being homeless,  and living in my car,  eating  only every few days,  at age 26,  is foreign and mind-boggling to normal people. \n\nBut we are not normal. \n\nI used to have things. Nice things. A nice apartment,  a new car,  the newest toys,  treating my mom to an expensive vacation every summer. Now I'm sleeping on the floor on her apartment a few days a week  and sleeping in my car the other half. \n\nHow I got here doesn't matter,  because lightning doesn't strike twice. \n\nThere is no repairing things I've broken. \n\nI got lucky with my career the first time around. That won't happen again. \n\nI have no brighter future, because I'm living my future. This is where my life was supposed to go,  how I was supposed to end up. \n\nAt least at this point,  I have nothing to worry about anymore. Things literally can't get any worse. \n\nMy mom came into the room and starting sobbing,  saying  she can't support me,  and that I have to figure something out. And that she's been so depressed lately because she feels so guilty. \n\nSo,  in the morning,  before she wakes up,  I'm leaving. I don't know where I'm going but at this point I'm done. I give up. Heroin wins. I can't keep trying anymore. There is no point in getting a minimum wage job because using what little energy I have to work my ass off,  for  a small percentage of what I used to make, is more upsetting to me than sleeping in my car. \n\nIt bears repeating,  if you're thinking of trying opiates,  or graduating to heroin,  DONT.  Unless you want this post to be you in a few years. My life is over. I'll never,  ever get it back. There's nothing I can do to ever be happy again. I wouldn't want this for my worst enemy. \n\nMy family cries for me,  my friends are to stressed to even worry about me anymore. \n\nI quite literally have nothing left. \n\nLet my life be a lesson for those who chip,  or are thinking about starting. \n\nMy life is not a life you want,  trust me. Waking up every morning is like being tortured slowly every single day. ","23":"So just this morning I got my Oregon state refund. Still waiting on another state but I'm so happy for this $200. Half is going to a bag,  and the other half is for living. I'm not totally broke!!! \n\nSo happy. ","24":"I hate my addict brain. So much. \n\nSo,  I have $70 to last 10 days. It'll be possible,  if I don't pick up \n\nBut I want a bag so bad. If I picked up,  I'd be totally broke,  and be right back in the same spot in 2 days. \n\nIf I took the 10 days and stopped,  I save the money for food and gas, and I take a tolerance break. The dope will there when I want it. My dealer isn't going anywhere. \n\nSo why am I panicking?? Taking a break will do nothing but good. My veins will at least partially rebound in that time, too. Ugh. \n\nWhy am I getting drugs when I'm living in my car? Because I can't stop. \n\nI even have subs so I won't even be sick. \n\nI just have to be patient. \n\nWe're going back to my moms place for the week. I'll have a place to relax,  and sleep. \n\nI might start writing,  or working on some projects,  or Netflix. \n\nThe dope around here is finally real. It's been so good,  and not fent shit. Bad time to stop. Or the perfect time. ","25":"We've been staying with my mom the last month or so. \n\nI managed to nail an awesome job,  get a place all setup.. Then job lost. I'm not sure why,  as I was behaving myself. Showing up early,  etc. \n\nIt's like,  no matter what happens,  I always fail. \n\nWith my final paycheck,  that was supposed to go toward rent for out new place,  I used it to go HARD on speedballs with the hope that my heart would stop. I mean,  I was doing a lot of crack. I mean,  a lot. It didn't work,  so now I'm laying around in the same clothes everyday,  maybe I'll eat,  but I just sit on Netflix. \n\nIm currently watching Scandal,  it's made the last week go by really fast.

Friends and dealers are more than happy to buy you food,  let you shower, etc. \n\nThats fucked up. No? \n\nAfter a REALLY big fight with my mom today,  she's letting us come over. That's usually how it goes. Screaming. Crying. Over it. \n\nThis is why I can't do this anymore. Ugh. ","27":"I honestly thought I'd never write on of these,  but here I am,  sobbing at my desk because Kevin was just tagged in a RIP post on Facebook. \n\nIt's true. \n\nKevin died last Sunday,  and I'm trying to figure out why. \n\nWe got pretty close over the last 2 years. He was always careful about never shooting up. To my knowledge he never did. \n\nBut the last 2 times I saw him,  he was completely blacked out on dope and benzos. He was puking,  and half asleep in the car 2 weeks ago when we picked up. \n\nHE JUST GRADUATED FROM FUCKING COLLEGE AND JUST STARTED A JOB. FUCK. \n\nHe last text me Saturday,  looking to score. I told him I couldn't help him. Apparently he found some anyway. \n\nIm not sure if drugs were involved,  waiting to hear back still,  but I'm almost positive it was a fatal mix of benzos and fent laced dope. \n\nIm so sad. Fuck,  I'm so sad. He'd text me when I'd make a post here,  asking if I was okay. Every time. \n\nNow,  I'm not okay. \n\nFuck this game. I'm out. I can't do this. \n\n***PSA: HIS DEATH WAS CAUSED BY A COMBINATION OF FENT,  BENZOS,  AND ALCOHOL. Even if you don't shoot,  fent is dangerous! Snorting will not save your life. ***","28":"So,  been living out of my car for like 2 weeks now. It's not terrible. I've been getting high a ton,  which helps me cope. Then I just spend all day in a coffee shop,  with wifi,  so it's not a huge deal \n\nSo yesterday,  a recruiter I've been working with told me a company wanted to interview me in an hour. It was a really fast turn around. I had to get ready fast,  and prepare. \n\nI ended up nailing the interview and I start the job on Friday!!! \n\nNot sure how I'm going to maintain this job while homeless,  but... I have to because it pays well enough that I'll be able to get a nice place after a few weeks. \n\nThings are slowly starting to get better. \n\nMy relationship with my parents is shit,  but once I start building my life back,  and getting my shit together they cant say shut about my use.

All without ever bugging me about payment. I paid them back each time, but man, it was so cool.\n\nMy dude back home now, I've known him the longest. When my sister died, he sat in my car, let me cry, turned off his phone, and gave m a bunch of dope. We even just talked about that night 2 days ago. He was like, \"dude, that was deep. If you ever need anything I'm here. You're a little destructive. You're still a good guy.\"","30":"A few years ago, I slipped on some ice after work. Think cartoon banana peel. It probably looked hilarious.\n\nI hurt my back really bad. Scheduled a dr appooint with my friends moms doctor because she said shes \"sympathetic to pain\" hint, hint.\n\nI met this doctor for the first time, and after a 10-minute check up, she gave me a script for 45x 5mg Percocet, and a bunch of Flexeril. FANTASTIC. Went back a week later, and got a pain contract.. for tramadol. I took it, but never refilled it. It's garbage.\n\nSo fast-forward to yesterday, my boyfriend can barely move. Hes been complaining about back pain that's getting worse everyday. I take him to the ER, thinking he'll get a one-offf script for oxy or something, and some muscle relaxers. Just like I did.\n\nNOPE.\n\n***I fucking took him to the same ER where they treated his fent OD like 5 days prior. I didn't even THINK about that.***\n\nThey said, \"we'd usually give something for pain, but you'll just have to make due with this\" (Flexeril)\n\nGODDAMIT.\n\nSo yeah, don't go to the same hospital for pain meds, where they've treated you for an OD.","31":"Just a heads up,  all of the ECP in the Minneapolis area is just all fent now. It's very,  very rare that you'll get real dope. \n\nThe area is known for having lots of fent,  but now its basically replaced heroin completely. \n\nUnless you get tar. Tar is legit. \n\nPlease be careful. ","32":"So last night,  my boyfriend prepped a shot. Nothing he hasn't done before. And not any more than he's done before. \n\nHe was unconscious within 15 seconds. His eyes closed and he fell forward. \n\nHe didn't totally stop breathing,  but with his sleep apnea,  his airway gets obstructed. So he was suffocating himself. \n\nWe didn't have any narcan,  so I called 911 and kept breathing for him until the ambulance got there. \n\nHad I not breathed for him,  he would have died. \n\nBecause of the overdose  we were kicked out of the place we were staying. \n\nOh,  and after, 3 days the company I started work for decided I wasn't getting tasks done fast enough and let me go. (the recruiter said it wasn't even my fault. He believes the company has unrealistic expectations) \n\nSo,  my boyfriend almost died,  we got kicked out,  and I don't have a job. \n\nWe slept in the car last night,  and probably will for some time. \n\nIm thankful for the vodka I have. Maybe I can drink my self unconscious today. Because fuck everything. I'm done. I give up.

I already  feel guilty enough for dragging people through my shit. \n\nMost of you will understand that drugs are the single reason I have for not killing myself. It's true. But as of tomorrow,  I won't have drugs to rely on. So,  I don't know how I'll handle it. The thirst for no longer being here is stronger than urge to get high. It's something that eats at you until the second you fall asleep. \n\nBut tomorrow,  I'm going to try to ignore those urges. Try to create some semblance of a normal life. Not for me,  for everyone around me. \n\nYou guys have brought me so much joy and companionship through some really awful times,  and while I might be a lurker every so often,  you'll see my name less and less,  and you may have even noticed my absence lately. \n\nIm hoping this clean shit will work...

I ordered a couple New York stamps from the darknet, and they arrived without issue.\n\nI remember the day more vividly than almost any other occasion. I know the exact date because it was the day before the Minneapolis Pride parade, and I was excited about my first couple stamps for the weekend.\n\nI was at my apartment in a Minneapolis suburb when the mail came. I could hardly open the package, I was so excited.\n\nI cut up a nice line, and up it went. My immediate thought was, verbatim, \"It feels just like Vicodin. That's it? Boring.\"\n\nNot 10 minutes after I did my very first line of dope, my mom arrives with  groceries and asks me to help get them. I enthusiastically agreed. It was, to this day, the most fun I've ever had unloading groceries.\n\nAfterwards, I went on a long walk. None of my friends were around but it was really sunny out so I wanted to be outside. Best. Walk. Ever.\n\nI don't think I've ever been that happy. It was scary. I didn't even get nauseous until like the 3rd or 4th day of consecutive use.\n\nAfter my walk, I went home and put on a history documentary, and did a few more lines. At this point I was nodding hardcore and I ended up falling asleep for 4 hours. During my nap I had the SCARIEST DREAM EVER. There was this dark red demon chasing me. I had heard of opiate nightmares, but man, that felt so real. It was the only time heroin ever gave me nightmares, though.\n\nI slept well that night.\n\nI spent the next couple months making bigger and bigger orders of stamps, successfully chipping for a while even. Even ordered some awesome DMT I smoked with a friend.\n\nLater on I found reddit (namely, this sub) but I can't remember HOW I found it. Ended up finding a local connect, and, well, the rest is history.\n\nDoes anyone else remember details about their very first time? Do you remember the day?

I'm not hungry, I'm not worrying about being sick as fuck. I'm clean, fed, stable, and I have a job. Why am I so ungrateful, and why do I have this massive ego like just because I used to make $30\/hr it means I'm too good to make $8.15\/hr (cry...)\n\nI spend all day drinking FAR too much caffeine, smoking too much weed, and WAY too many cigarettes..\n\nIt's about to get cold as hell which means my seasonal depression will REALLY test my sobriety and push it to it's limits.\n\nI have a few friends offering to get me back to my hometown. If m boyfriend wasn't in the picture, I'd be back in  MN, which means I'd be using again. So, while I want to, I also... don't want to.

Might port it to Android\/iOS at some point.\n\nHow are my favorite people? &lt;3 If anyone's bored, let me know. I' super talkative at the moment, haha.\n\n***Edit: here's a screenshot of my game. It's basically block dude on steroids. Like 12 different block types, weapons, etc. It's pretty neat.***\n\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/Xp0xoZZ","56":"Did you ever find out who the dealer was and where he lived and is he kicking some your way?","57":"Soo, it's been 6 weeks-ish. My head's leveling off. BF and I both got jobs today (at the same place). Not exactly super excited, but I'm excited to get a paycheck.\n\nI haven't been clean this long in 2 years.\n\nLast time I had any length of clean time was December 2014 (30 days)\n\nAlso, the last time I started getting a paycheck again is when things got really bad... soo it's kinda like I'm wondering what'll happen when I actually have spendable cash.\n\nI mean, I would be able to get dope if I truly wanted to (and I do want to), but I won't have nearly as much income as I have before and that will have a huge impact.\n\nAlthough... I was told I'm allowed to use pills if I don't go overboard lol. Gotta find them pharms!\n\nOh, off topic, but everyone's getting morbo's book on Halloween?? SO EXCITED.","58":"Not opiate related,  but I'm sure you all know this antihistamine is garbage.  I was reading last night and apparently \"numerous\"  studies say that hydroxyzine has the equivalent anxiolytic,  sedative,  and hypnotic effects as benzos. Nope. \n\nIf anything it makes me super energized (a rare symptom,  but possible my doctor says) \n\nAnyone use it successfully to potential dope or pills?","59":"Talking to a friend and I just realized I could get dope in more states than I've even visited. Good to know, I guess LOL. \n\n(but, still, I'm 5 weeks clean today. Ew)","60":"Since you're all so intrigued (lol) I figured I'd update you guys. \n\nGot 1.5lb of seeds for $12. Cool right? No. The containers said \"100% pure. Nothing added\"  and they looked really nice. \n\nI am only slightly sedated and warm. They were either bunk or super weak.\n\nThey weren't very bitter,  if at all But...  They had that nice dark yellow\/brown tint to it. \n\nGlad it was only $12 wasted. Ah well. Got some strips of etiz coming in a few days. Should have me fucked right up.","61":"Everything is ready and I'm hours away from my first PST batch in a year and my first opiate in a month. I kept think about how excited I am. \n\nI've never been this excited to get high before. Then what would you call it when I would get well?  Not excitement. \n\nRelief. \n\nI can't tell you how good it feels to be excited I can get high,  and not relieved because I have to. \n\nBeing excited is way better than feeling relieved.","62":"So, I started a business 2 years ago, and sometimes it pays out. I got a check today and hopefully the deposit will be in my Simple tomorrow morning.\n\nI plan on nodding so hard with these awesome seeds I found at the small grocery store down the street. I also plan on ordering some Etiz, and maybe some stimulant RC.\n\nCan't spend alll the money on getting high, though. I have shit to do. It'll be a really nice escape for a little while, though.\n\nI hope everyone who wants to get faded this weekend will be able to :D\n\n**EDIT: Fuck. Simple waited until 20 minutes AFTER the cutoff to tell me the photo was too blurry. Now I'm sober until Tuesday. -_-**\n\n**EDIT 2: Ignore my edit. They got it in before the cutoff. TOMORROW IT IS!**","63":"This feels like a total noob question and I apologize. \n\nBasically a month clean,  but in the next week I'm getting some seeds. Hopefully this weekend even. \n\nWould 2 pounds be too much if the seeds are decent? \n\nSorry for asking a dumb question.","64":"At least a dozen 6.5oz bottles of clearly unwashed poppy seeds for $4 each. \n\nThat means i can go down the street and get 1.2lb for $12. \n\nNo shipping. No waiting. \n\nYesssssss","65":"I've been gaining some clean time by isolating myself the last few weeks as you probably know. It's been a nice tolerance break. \n\nThings are really stressful where I'm at and I'm constantly on edge which is why... when a check for me comes in the mail (YAY MONEY) later this week I'm getting high off my ass with PST.\n\nOr maybe some benzos. Probably weed, too.\n\nI just can't sit around with nothing flooding my brain. I've actually been doing okay without sticking a needle in my arm, I just need SOMETHING.\n\n&lt;3","66":"While I'm sitting around doing nothing, I've been wanting to get high like nothing else. But today is a little different. \n\nBoyfriends mom gave me weed and xanax. I really missed my namesake drugs :)\n\nThat'd all I guess. Haha, I'm just really happy to not be stone sober.","67":"As I sit around doing absolutely nothing with my days (just for now, I hope) I've been wondering why being clean is SO hard.\n\nI think it's because I never expected to live this long, so I have no idea what to do with myself now. Just looking around like, \"uhhhh, what now?\"\n\nOh, and here's a tip for addicts who are using or just getting clean: Do NOT date non-users. They just don't understand and it only causes stress, and you'll be bitched at, even when you're getting clean. They'll nitpick every part of your reddit posts and demand you talk about every part. Ugh.\n\nI don't want to be clean, I'm not ready but I have no choice.","68":"Been clean for 2 weeks today and I HATE IT. I'm so bored I'd give anything to get high... but it probably won't be happening for quite some time which is probably a good thing.\n\nSince I don't have a car, or job, and I'm living in a really small town with my boyfriend and his parents, I have nothing to do at ALL.\n\nIt's also difficult to pretend to be \"fine\" in front of everybody when in reality I just wanna cry all day long.\n\nDo your next shot\/line\/smoke for me :D\n\n**Edit: Might be making a new account to post this stuff under... boyfriend keeps reading my stuff when all I wanna do is post about it, not talk about it.**","69":"So I'm 24 hours away from officially living with my boyfriends parents. I am terrified because I know what it means. \n\nIt means I'm starting over. I had an awesome life, and was mostly content. Until I wasn't. \n\nIn the last 30 hours I've begun waking up from my drug induced coma and its not pretty at all. Just sitting here with my thoughts is slowly KILLING me. \n\nI've realized that while all my friends had their shit together they all got married, had babies, and are farther along in their career than I am. Even if I kicked ass I couldn't catch up. That's a nasty pill to swallow. I'm nowhere near accomplishing anything. \n\nThe hard part won't be staying clean, it will be finding the motivation to start over. I haven't found it on this bus yet. I wanna run away at every stop. I don't even know if I CAN get what I lost. If I can, I don't even know where to start. \n\nHow do you find the motivation to give a shit? Because at present, I don't.","70":"So after being on this bus for 9 hours with a few days clean, I've realized I have things I have to work out. Things I'd rather not, but I have to. \n\nMy little sister and I were very close. She called me daily. We always hung out. She always wanted to hear about the guys I dated. Even wanted to set me up a few times haha. \n\nI am 2 years older than her so we grew up together and had the same friends. Our rooms were next to each other even. \n\nAs we got older we just got closer. She'd always tell me how proud she was of me (I had a kick ass career and life was just generally great)\n\nBut on December 2nd, 2011 I got a phone call from my mom to drive home. I fought her. It was midnight and I lived 90 minutes from home. But I still got in my car and drove home. \n\nI first tried calling my sister to see what's going on. She didn't answer her phone. I didn't think anything of it. \n\nWhen I got in the door, I could tell my mom was crying. Oh shit. \n\n\"Carlie was in a car accident. She didn't make it\"\n\nI threw up. I spent the next 12 hours just not even believing it. My parents had to take my phone away from me so I'd stop calling her. It was bad. \n\nTo this day we don't know what caused the accident. But I do know horrible details about the accident that makes it worse (she laid in the snow alone before she died, and the ambulance was just pulling up as she passed. )\n\nAt the funeral everyone kept saying how beautiful she was. My parents had her wearing her favorite zebra print shirt and her hair curled. Yes, she was beautiful. \n\nI spent the next month seeing her face every time I closed my eyes and just in a general fog. I quit my job, left my apartment and moved home. \n\nMy mom started giving me her oxy and I never stopped. \n\nI haven't been clean long term since then. \n\nWhen I talk to people about my habit they often say, \"your sister wouldnt want...'\n\nAnd I lose it every time. It's so old.\n\nIt's been 3 years and I've only gotten worse. I don't even know what to do with myself anymore. I hope I'll stay clean, and I'll be in an environment conducive to it. So it won't be hard. \n\nMaybe I'll fall asleep at some point on this bus. I hope.","71":"I did a rapid sub taper, and I'm 6 days clean. I get to be on a bus for 58 hours (moving to Michigan). I'm SO glad I'm not physically dependant anymore. \n\nI won't end up homeless because my boyfriends parents got me a ticket and made me move in. I suppose that's a good thing. I kept telling him to leave without me. \n\nMaybe moving to a place with no connections, without a  dependence, will lead to me finally staying clean. I'm ready to stop worrying about getting well and money and hiding my shit. \n\nI don't wanna live in the middle of nowhere but maybe it's for the best.","72":"I've gotten so much love and support and even offers of REAL HELP. \n\nLuke and I are just in awe. The love here is unmatched. \n\nThere are people in my messages offering food, places to stay, transportation, and just and ear to listen. \n\nI've been crying all day. \n\nThank you, opiates. So much. I'd name you all, but there are tons. Just know I'll reply to EVERYTHING. \n\njust amazing.","73":"I'm sick. In a week il be homeless. No job. Money. Food. Nothing. \n\nI probably deserve it. Hopefully this klonipin, booze and maybe some gabapentin will help me sleep. \n\nNever ever thought I'd be here. Ever.","74":"STOPPIT!\n\nUs PNWers drool so hard seeing your fat lines of precious ECP, it makes our actual fire tar look like, well, shit.\n\nHappy Monday &lt;3","75":"Most of you know I have a boyfriend who I've been using behind his back for a little while.\n\nHe said if I used, he'd leave me. Fair enough.\n\nSo after some thought, I told him I couldn't stop soon enough. Figured he'd be better off anyway. \n\nWell, my plan fucking backfired. \n\nHe got tears in his eyes and said, \"I don't care. I'm not leaving. I love you. \"\n\nAnd after some talking I was going to pick up anyway. Fuck me, right?\n\nAt the end he kissed my cheek and whispered in my ear, \"please be careful\"\n\nJESUS FUCKING CHRIST WHAT JUST HAPPENED.\n\nFor this moment. And this moment only. I am firmly planted in this bedroom. \n\nHoly. Shit. Maybe I'll stop crying next week.","76":"i love having dudes who are awake before you are. just got 6 points :)\n\nI've been trying to slow down for my boyfriends sake, but the cravings this morning were SO BAD. \n\nMaybe one day...","77":"I only ask because I was watching Intervention and they said this girl was shooting Percocet. There's no way she could do that and live right? Hell, snorting percs is bad..\n\nDo they know what they were talking about, or is it possible without any problems? It made shudder...","78":"Since I moved out here 3 months ago, I've overdosed on meth, almost died from speedballs, fallen out like twice.... was hospitalized twice (once for a suicide attempt) and almost lost my job.\n\nNow, I'm clean, I have my dream job, and I have someone who loves me.\n\nBut today I was notified my application to be added as a roommate on my friends apartment was denied, so I technically can't stay here. He moved back home, and he can't afford to break the lease.\n\nSo, he's basically counting on me to be here to pay for stuff.\n\nHe said he's fine with us staying here (even though we technically can't be), so that's good. For now. I'm still freaking out because most of you know my boyfriend is moving out here in TWO WEEKS to live with me... I kinda need a place for him to stay when he gets out here. Sounds like I do for the moment.\n\nI want a break, please?","79":"My roommates moved out last night. My paycheck clears Monday. I'm all by myself for 2 weeks. Will I or won't I relapse? That is the question. I really want to because I get super lonely when I'm by myself, but I could lose a LOT if I do\n\nHope you all get what you need this weekend!","80":"Tomorrow is payday. Tomorrow both of my roommates are moving out and I'll be alone for 16 days.\n\nHow the HELL am I going to stay clean... I've been doing a mostly okay job of distracting myself lately.\n\nThere's a Kava bar by my work I really wanna try. That stuff knocks me OUT COLD.","81":"So, I've never been tested for anything, and I've put myself in some not-so-safe situations. My boyfriend is moving across the country so we can be together and he knows all about my use and stuff and he says he doesn't care if I end up testing positive for anything, and that he'll just let me give it to him because he plans on marrying me.\n\nHow nuts does that sound? I plan on getting tested before he gets here, and then we'll know for sure.\n\nThe only thing that scares me is that I've shared needles. Oh well, nothing I can do about it now.","82":"Been clean 13 days. I feel okay. None of my connects are responding, I have no idea why. Maybe its for the better because I'm craving BAD.\n\nBut in 42 days, the single reason I'd stay clean is moving in. I'm really optimistic but my addict brain is trying to psych me out.\n\nHow is everyone doing?","83":"Anyone ever get an IV, or blood drawn from someone in anesthesiology in a vein they didn't know existed?\n\nI got blood drawn today twice right in the middle of my arm, to the right of my crook. They felt a huge vein, but I can't at all.\n\nThey're wizards. and I thought I was good at my body. :P","84":"Still in the hospital. Day 7. I'm on day 12 of being clean. No more withdrawal.\n\nBut the doctors gave me some news last night night. Something is wrong with my heart, so they did an EKG, and took some blood this morning.\n\nGreat. Right as I planned on getting my shit together. \n\nBut at this point, dope is the only thing that will put me to sleep. The sleeping pill they gave me didnt even work last night so I somehow got 3 hours of sleep.\n\nI hope I dont use when I get out, but if my stress comes back... or if I lose my job... my hopes will be gone.","85":"I've been clean 11 days. Cold turkey.\r\rMy heart is beating out of my chest, but my mood is great.\r\rAfter a recent suicide attempt I've been in the hospital since Monday.\r\rI plan on staying clean, mostly for one person. The love of my life. \r\r9\/12\/2012 a new Facebook friend decided to visit me. He stayed 2 weeks. \r\rNow instead of getting high and ruining my life, im planning (with his mom) to surprise him for his birthday in 2 months.\r\rWe haven't seen each other in almost 3 years but that doesn't diminish what I've always felt.\r\rIf I can find a reason to stay clean, every reader of this sub does.\r\rIm NOT leaving :)","86":"At first I loved speedballs, but now their magic is gone ao I just feel the coke and strung out. \n\nGot some ice Today and I'm pumped for the rush. To me,meth is a  nice clean high over coke no euphoria. \n ","87":".. as I pour this shot into my nose because I forgot to go to the exchange today. Fuck. Me.\n\nBetter than nothing :\/\n\nBeing gay, you'd think I'd be a fan of another, more efficient ROA, but I actually HATE it lol. Props to those who don't flinch.","88":"I get my first paycheck in 2 months on July 10th.and on monday a payment of $800 from a friend is posting my account.\n\nMost of you know I've been struggling with withdrawal \/ getting dope.\n\nSo, today I managed to get one of my dudes to get me a sack for 2 subs.. he USUALLY does 4. He felt bad so he's like, \"Fine. JUST once.\"\n\nand I got to see my partner in crime, \"A FRIEND\" (he didn't like being called out) today.\n\nSo at the moment I'm not sick... but the next few days will be a mental challenge. luckily I have Hulu &amp; Workoholics to distract me :D\n\nLet's all hope that the cash posts on Monday and I can score and finally do a proper fucking speedball. Otherwise I just have to wait until Friday.. then my money issues will be wiped out.","89":"First started snorting a few times a week in June 2013. Now I IV as much as humanly possible. I often reflect on how I got here... the milestones are permanently part of my memory. IVing for the first time... getting that first non-middle phone number... meeting other users and actually becoming close friends... then destroying my life in the process.\n\nI remember where I was when I snorted for the first time. When I IVd, too. When I copped for the first time. All these firsts make me smile. My favorite is walking my friend through the process of IVing for the first time over the phone.. and after 10 minutes, he did it! That made me super proud, haha.\n\nThe fond memories are getting me through the sickness. \n\nAs always, love you guys.","90":"AND BITCHES ARE OUT. It never takes them this long to reup. Jesus.\n\nStill dying :P","91":"I'm broke. So I'm sick. And it hurts. Physically and mentally. It doesn't help that I'm already suicidal but oh boy. Advil and kava tea really help with the physical stuff. We have a lava bar out here that im going to tomorrow but for now... My flesh feels like it's falling off my bones and I will do ANYTHING for it to stop. \n\nAhhhhhh. ","92":"Tomorrow I get my LAST bag for almost 2 weeks. I can't stop, but I have to take a break. I started my job just on time for a decent pay check. So in about 10 days, I can get super high. :D\n\nIf you're sick over the next week and a half, I'll be with you.\n\nOh and one of my closest friends proposed today. He was serious.","93":"I've been here 2 months. I have all the connects I need. I just got a fancy job but today is actually the first day in 3 months I haven't used daily. So I'm sweating my balls off and the sub I've been saving isn't doing ANYTHING for all my sensitive nerves. Seriously, someone walks by and I shudder. Blech, nothing a little dopamine rush from music can't at least patch up for now.\n\nSo, I guess I LOVE my new area and new job. I'M EVEN DATING A GUY. IMAGINE THAT LOL.\n\nTotally random post but I haven't talked to a bunch of you in a while. Figured I'd give an update.\n\n(PS- the movie Cake on Netflix is fucking amazing. Don't watch it when you're emotional, you'll jump off a building.)","94":"What. The. Fuck. \n\nSomething just happened. I just did a speedball nothing too large; in fact I've done larger before. I feel the response almost killed me. First it was fine. Then my body got tingly. Then it hurt like an artery from head to toe. Then my heard was so bizarre. Like I was hearing noises I couldn't possibly ever describe the sounds I was hearing. I didn't know if I hit an artery, if the shit was bad, or what. \n\nI've had both before without ANY issues. \n\nWhat. The. Fuck. \n\nEDIT: yes, 5 minutes later I was alright. It just stopped. But the sound effects I was hearing was soooooo bizarre. ","95":"I've been using every single day for at LEAST the last month. I thought I was doing a good job, but my roommates wanted to go through my shit today. Luckily I was able to ditch everything before they caught me. I could tell they suspected, but I never expected them to actually confront me.\n\nI have been really careless lately.. not caring how much I do, or what happens. But now my tolerance is so high, I barely feel 4 points. I should try a G shot.\n\nI love this place, and I'm even dating (sort of) which is way more than I can say for my hometown. A friend of mine said I should tell the guy I'm seeing about my use... HA, YEAH RIGHT GIRL. PSH. NOT HAPPENING.\n\nI need a shot now, lol.\n\n&lt;3 you guys.","96":"Hiya. Haven't posted really anything since I've moved. My life has been put on pause, but my drug use has only gotten worse. \n\nComing out here, I ended up meeting an awesome guywho helped me out a ton. He ended up giving me 3 numbers. The cast of characters I've met is nothing short of entertaining. \n\nIm currently wait for a  G to be delivered to me, and even if I get there at the same time they do, they'll still apologize for being late. These guys are the nicest, and they serve as early as 6am I've heard. \n\nHow has everyone been??","97":"who's withdrawal symptoms are WAY worse when snorting. IVing, they're so minimal, it's almost non-existent.\n\nWhen I was snorting, if I stopped for any length of time, I was bed-ridden. Sweating, runny nose, entire body on fire but now I just have a tiny bit of anxiety in my chest, and no physical symptoms at all. No sweating, no watery eyes. It's the WEIRDEST thing.","98":"So, it took moving across the country to realize I was getting fucked at $120\/g before. I'm paying about $90\/g or $10\/point now which I'm hearing is only because I don't have the \"golden\" connect.\n\nWow, so much money wasted.","99":"I just up and moved 1700 miles. I have no family and very few friends out here. I have all the dope in the world, though. It's only half as good as where I'm from. It sucks.\n\nJust when I start to get really anxious about everything, I calm myself down. I hope moving was the right thing. It happened so fast...","100":"In 48 hours I'll start the 26 hour drive to the Pacific Northwest. I already have more numbers there than I do here. So much for getting clean, if anything it'll get worse but.. who cares?\n\nIn a few hours I'll be picking up for the last time in Minneapolis. I'm really excited to leave. Most people would be nervous but I couldn't be more excited. \n\nMy best friend said if I move out there and I continue using, she'll open the gates of hell on me lol. I feel bad, but I've gotten really good at hiding it.\n\nI'm watching Intervention at work (that needle fix, yo), what's everyone else doing??","101":"so i pick up fairly often and when my guy cant get more and i get sick, he usually throws me a point or 2 from his own stash.  today hes bringing me some at work  im going to miss this kind of service when I move :(","102":"I've only used once in like the last 2 weeks. Subs made my landing smooth. I feel OKAY... but bored. Just got the results of an interview I had the other day, and submitted my code test and basically they really want me. So I'm expecting a formal offer in the next day. That would mean moving to PDX, WOO :D\n\nBut it gives me pause. I may have found an \"easy\" way out if I treat it that way, but I'm leaving behind really good friends who are just going to get worse and it kills me. One of these friends asked me to help him shoot up, so I taught him. Never doing that again, my god. he's worse than me now :( it makes me sad.\n\nI'm actually kinda close with these 2 college kids who pick up every so often. They only smoke tar (at the moment). I'm really glad I met them, they're good kids, but.. if I just gave them the key to the city...I don't know what I'll do if they end up like me. I'd never forgive myself.\n\n(I know they're reading this, so guys you know I care about you, so take my warnings seriously... I never did)\n\nI really hope I don't use again.","103":"I met Matt in 2011 through some mutual friends. We haven't spoken much in the last year, and just tonight when I go to message him I found out he died of a heroin overdose in January.\n\nGOD DAMMIT. He was one of the good ones.\n\nTEST SHOTS PEOPLE.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.burnhamours.com\/obits\/obituary.php?id=527794","104":"I don't entirely know and that's probably a good thing. All I know are bit and pieces of memory flashes here and there (thanks, Etizolam)\n\nBut I just know my mom, dad, and brother ALL confronted me and asked what the hell I was doing.\n\nMy dad owns a restaurant so we all met up there for brunch. I remember going there but I don't remember anything else. But I heard it was bad. I'll ask my brother for details today and update the post.\n\nIt started on Saturday when a friend and her boyfriend took me to a movie. After the movie I think I suggested we get meth, and we did. Over the next couple hours I was all over my friend's boyfriend... which they were both fine with. He totally didn't care -- only after proclaiming he was straight a million times, haha. Which then lead to .. (I'll let your imagination go from here)\n\nI was dropped off at 8am Easter morning and that's the last thing I remember.\n\nThat was, hands down, the craziest weekend I've ever had. I did things I never thought I'd do. I regret nothing, except embarrassing my parents with whatever it is I did.\n\nAfter everything that happened this weekend, I realized I'm jealous of the connection my friends have. If you have someone in your life you share everything with, don't take it for granted. There are those of us who sit around alone everyday.\n\n(If you guys are reading this, thanks for everything)","105":"Today is payday, and I have tomorrow off work.\n\nSo, I'm picking up for the first time since Sunday! YES. Nodding all day tomorrow sounds awesome. Anyone else have absolutely no plans tomorrow??\n\nOh, and I saw someone else post a pic with his eyes all effed up. Mine get REALLY bad, so maybe I'll post one, too. It's pretty hilarious.","106":"I haven't hard a car since September when I took too many benzos and crashed it. Oops.\n\nBut that hasnt stopped me from getting dope. I take the train downtown, then take a bus to my guys house. \n\nThe only shitty part is that he's tar only :( I need a vehicle to get the kickass powder here. Oh well, tar is better than nothing, and cheaper too.\n\nI know some of you drive across state lines, and even drive for hours to cop. What's the longest trip you've made just to get dope??\n\nStay safe &lt;3","107":"The title is kind of a metaphor for the last few days.\n\nFirst of all, the coolest people on the internet are in this sub and made yesterday really awesome for me. I'm clean-ish and I actually feel fine (I really hope to stay that way.). \n\nAfter my best friend moved, I got really lonely  and I'm still struggling with it but I'm becoming more okay with not being the social butterfly I was before ever using. Actually meeting people here has really helped with that actually.\n\nHere's to no dope, more friends, and who knows what else.\n\nI'll be on TinyChat on and off most of the night, so don't leave me alone, haha","108":"So, why am I posting today? Because I'm chatty, and I won't wanna hear the word \"birthday' tomorrow.\n\ngot some free subs so I feel good today. but it FUCKING SNOWED last night. So, fuck that.\n\nBasically, you're my only people. All my IRL \"friends\" are all married with kids.. and here I am, 25 and never dated (gay guy here). Kinda puts a damper on having any fun. So I'll be around here tomorrow. \n\nFeel free to say hi if we've never talked! :D\n\n(PS, super chatty today, so say hi today too, haha)\n\nLove you all, stick around plzzzzz.\n\nEDIT: My mom said something that stopped me stone cold. Because she's so right. She said, and I quote, \"No wonder you have no friends. Nobody wants to get close to someone who's going to die!\"\n\nThat's rough.\n\n**Edit 3: I have no words. I never expected much of a response to this bratty post, but I'm beyond overwhelmed by how great you all are. Today will be better than I hoped and its because of you.**","109":"Sunday's are the days I usually run out so I kinda just lounge around.\n\nBut it looks like my crystal guy might have a friend who can get some dope! He gave it up a while ago due to all the shit, but said he'll help me out.\n\nI'm so excited, guys.","110":"He replied, \"Bro we had this talk once before they not trying to meet anyone else I tried to hook up one of the brothers with him no good later don't ask me that no more\"\r\rWTF is my deal? Ugh, fuck!\r\rTime to go with someone else. ","111":"This is the longest I've gone without dope since I started shooting. Yesterday I basically wanted to die. \r\rI decided to pop a couple caffeine pills about an hour ago and I feel like I can run a few miles. I feel great. Plus im probably copping today. \r\rHope today is better than yesterday! \r\rOh and if you haven't had the pleasure of chatting at length with Tracey, do so! She distracted me almost all day yesterday from the crazy anxiety. \r\rLove you all bunches!","112":"I hate them so much. It can take me a good 10 minutes to register with a brand new rig.\r\rBut the longer ones are easier to handle with my massive, clumsy hands. \r\rAnybody have any tips to make hitting with short ones easier? My arm looks like a nasty pincushion. ","113":"My closest friend is moving accross the country today. She told me last week. Like what the hell. \r\rShe was the only friend who still give a shit about me. \r\rNow all I have is my using friends, endless dope, and the broke\/dope cycle. \r\rHoping to score a small bag today to forget for ay least a little while. \r\rWithdrawing and being sick SUCKS. ","114":"Up until today he's been hesitant but he bought some rigs today, and asked me to help him.\n\nI simply walked him through some tips, and after 15 minutes, he registered. :)\n\nIf you're having issues registering, just call me haha.","115":"I have a few connects that I trust with my money. I found out a friend of mine has a local H guy. I should have a bag within the hour... If not, well shit. ","116":"so, my use is relatively hidden. My connects \/ using friends aren't connected in anyway to my \"real\" life.. yet Facebook happens to suggest my tar guy, and a using friend as \"people I may know\"\nYOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT FACEBOOK. Of course I added them lol","117":null,"118":"The best damn text message ever!!\r\rSometimes my tar boy is around early (like today) and somwtimes it takes him all day.\r\rBut as soon as he sends \"Im here\", I jump out of my desk, take the elevator down 8 floors and navigate the skyway for 4 blocks. And proceed to do a drug deal in one of the most active buildings downtown. \r\rToday we did it not 10 feet from a cop.\r\rGoddamn I love being high!!","119":"So I finally did the math and my last shot was on November 20th. So I'm 32 days in but certain circumstances will put me in touch with some tar today and im so excited. \n\nIM not worried about getting sucked in again because this is just a 1 time event due to my new job. (I'm doing a test run to find my office so I don't get lost on my first day)\n\nIt's gonna feel SO good to push off &lt;3","120":"I haven't gone this long with  single opiate in like 2 years. Meth made the physical WD super easy. But now I CANT SLEEP FOR SHIIIIT. I stay up at late and wake up by 6am. EVeryday. That would be great if I didn't get let go in October.\n\nI'm just glad I have some sort of a support system while I try to find a job because unemployment is NOT close to enough to pay my bills.\n\nBut at least I'm clean.","121":"So I've been crashing on my friends couch for the past month after I lost my job. I've been waiting for unemployment to kick in for 3 weeks and it finally came! And my friend gave me some dope that doesn't suck! \n\nNow that I have cash, I can now prepare for Thanksgiving next week so I won't be sick, and I can go out and do shit, like buy food =P\n\nHope your weekend goes well :)","122":"So guys, I went to treatment!\n\nFirst thing I did when I got back? Fixed up 3 fat shots. And now I'm drinking myself to sleep. \n\nMaybe I'll get help one day. Maybe I won't wake up at all one day. \n\nEither is ok with me. \n\nI'm thinking of getting on subs long-term also. \n\nHow's everyone??","123":"I used to rely on lope and etiz. \n\nDiclazepam gets rid of every symptom except the faucet in the bathroom ;)\n\nBut that's what lope is for. \n\nDiclazepam is great. Take 3-5mg. (If you can find \/ import it)","124":"In the last week I've started using the needle 95% of the time. I love every part of it. The initial breaking of the skin, the blood plume knowing you're in, and the obsessive excitement when you're pushing down the plunger knowing whats coming.\n\nSO... my issue has been registering. Out of 10 attempts, I MAYBE register once. Maybe. So either I just get pissed and snort it, but probably plug it, but tonight, I wouldn't give up and I hit the biggest shot I've mixed so far! The cotton was 2-3 days old so I'm a little worried.\n\nThe point of the post is that if you're like me and have issues registering- DONT GIVE UP! They're always a vein, and there's always a way.\n\nI'm super high and happy, how are you? :)","125":"So the first time someone hit me, he found a vein. I have HUGE juice veins in my crooks. \n\nNow that I boUght rigs I can't find a vein for shit. \n\nAll this poking is gonna call for lots of long sleeves. \n\nI did hit on my first try, though. That was cool. But I wanted another shot but NOPE. IT WOULDNT REGISTER. Ugh. Maybe tomorrow. \n\nI hate not knowing everything about shooting. ","126":"And I don't think I'll be going back. \n\nIt was the most heavenly feeling ever. \n\nI'm already fiending for my shot of tar tomorrow. \n\nWell, I'm fucked. ","127":"Since my new job noticied when Id take hours for \"lunch\"\n\nA good using friend said hell bring me a bag TO MY OFFICE for me. \n\nAfter I totalled my car on Etiz, he drove me to work 2 days when he could've slept in. \n\nI LOVE my friends.  ","128":"It's day 7 of being clean. But you know who gets my paycheck today. It's gross but I can't wait to be high. ","129":"So my dealer may have walked off with $50. That's very unlike him but he says to come pick up my bag after work. So hopefully he's still legit.\nHe knows I just a great job at the one of the biggest companies in the Midwest and knows my salary is like doubling and told him my use was only going to get larger. \n\nIf he took my $50 in exchange for hundreds of dollars in a few weeks, serves him right. \n\nSo I'm sitting at day 2 of my new job and I'm sick as HELL. I didn't take anything this morning because id get well before work. NOPE. \n\nMy new job is awesome in so many ways but if I have to start my search for a dboy over again im going to flip my shit. It took me 4 months to find this guy...\n\nDealers, man. It's disappointing. \n\n*EDIT: he was legit! I picked up the bag after work! WOO*","130":"I'm going to wake up in a world of hurt tomorrow morning. I know meth typically helps WD symptoms, but would these 20mg Adderall XR be worth taking upon awaking? I have butt loads of gabapentin so I'll be taking a gram before work to see what that does (typically doesn't work for me, but I have nothing else)\n\nI get paid tomorrow like some of you, but I've been spending $50-$100 a day on dope and it needs to slow the hell down, like, now.\n\nIf you're sitting pretty and all stocked-up, I hate you. Have a pleasant evening for me.","131":"Yesterday picked up a bag and nodded like I literally never have before. The single greatest feeling of my entire life, and I only sniff.\n\nDude is out today. Fuck.\n\nWaiting for him to re-up and just hoping it's the same shit. It went from shitty as hell to almost pure in a few weeks.\n\nWhen's the last time you've gotten stuff so pure, only to have it gone the next day?\n\nI WANT THE SAME SHIT DAMMIT!","132":"Siting in my car waiting for my dealer. \n\nA big dude pulls up, \"you looking for &lt;guys name&gt;?\"\n\n\"Yeah... Maybe.\"\n\n\"I got the H right here. \"\n\nHe plops a huge bag on my lap, I give him the cash. \n\nHe also put his number in my phone. I may be hitting up him now.  \n\nHappy Friday!\n","133":"That pretty much sums up my day. Can't afford to pick up until Friday. Dosed 50mg of lope between last night and this morning. Thank god I had the foresight to dose before going to bed because even on the 30mg I took last night.. I still woke up with the shakes, and promptly took another 20mg.\n\nI'm now sitting at work, mostly well. I have my kava tea, more lope, and a bunch of tramadol. \n\nGetting high isn't even fun anymore.","134":"http:\/\/www.drugs-forum.com\/forum\/showthread.php?t=231815\n\nThis makes me less nervous about withdrawals. I was just prescribed gabapentin and I have both DXM-only pills and generic loperamide gels. \n\nLet's get this bitch ON tomorrow!\n\n(Mother-fucking... I did my last line again instead of saving it for the morning.)","135":"Waiting on the dboy, sick. \n\nI also made my first purchase on the Darknet last night! 100mg of pure alprazolam. Should be here in a few days. \n\nI should've popped a few trams before waiting for dude. It's been almost 3 hours now :(\n\nI do plan on doing volumetric dosing with the alprazolam. After I dip my finger and lick it, of course ;)","136":"Most of you know me as \/u\/YoudLike2Know - I figured a better username was in order. I've been high as a mofo on Etizolam solution and heroin. I contemplated turning to the spike, but instead I'm waiting on some tar from a friend of mine.\n\nWhile benzos are my thing, opiates are my candy.\n\nIt's going to be a very, very high evening.","137":"I\u2019ve been clean for a while now and occasionally I pop in to say i haven\u2019t died (are there even any OGs around these days even? I don\u2019t even recognize the mod list...)\n\nBut I was thinking right when I got on methadone last year, I got this dope that was really strange. I don\u2019t remember feeling high, I just remember a \u201ctrippy\u201d feeling. It was SUPER dysphoric for daaaayyyss and I just found out some kappa opioid agonists can do that. \n\nHas anyone had that had before? Are there any particular cuts that would induce such a dysphoric feeling? I meant to ask back then but I was busy.","138":"So I posted a few days ago about how much my life has gotten better. And I got a lot of support. \n\nBut I\u2019ve been thinking about a lot of things recently. \n\nI have an ex whose life I practically imploded in every possible way. \n\nHe blocked me on FB last year suddenly. But we remained friendly from the time we broke up until then. (Like a 2y span) \n\nThen suddenly yesterday my mom asks why she couldn\u2019t see his FB profile anymore. And I had to explain that I knew exactly why he did it. \n\nI assume he woke up one day and realized that I\u2019m a shitty person and he deserved way better. But now my moms upset because she loved him and she misses talking to him. \n\nSo now I\u2019ve spent this weekend actually trying to process what I did to him. \n\nIt was BAD. And I know that. I was bad. I was very harmful, incredibly manipulative and VERY uncaring. \n\nAnd somehow he found this out (I have no idea. We do still have mutual friends tho) and sent a friend to explain what I already knew. \n\nI guess he\u2019s engaged to an amazing guy, and they\u2019re buying a house soon. And he basically just needed to cut me out so he can heal and build a life for himself. \n\nI am incredibly happy for him. Genuinely. I\u2019m just very guilty for what I put him through. \n\nFor those that have extended clean time, how do you deal with the guilt of hurting people in your past?","139":"You guys I can\u2019t believe it. \n\nI\u2019ve been clean for like 13 months. \n\nYesterday I got  job offer at a treatment center and I started crying. They said he was incredibly impressed and they really wanted me. \n\nI just cannot believe where\u2019re I\u2019m at. \n\nI used to be homeless and unemployed and now I\u2019m doing SO WELL. \n\n(If you even remotely remember me, this would shock you)","140":"So saturday i fucked myself up omehow overnight and ended up with 2 slipped herbiated discs in my back and pretty aever sciatic nerve damage.

Completed the week, and got sent home with no prospects of any inpatient programs to affect me for a minimum of 3 weeks. ...so of course after that suboxone was finished and out if my system, as much as I really wanted sobriety this time around, I picked some heroin up. I didn't IV it though I snorted it lol so of course that makes it all OK now smh......well anyway I'm still an addict, and can't get into a rehab till third week of March. Smh so I have to wait before anywhere has a bed open to get in. \n\nSo next week or so I'll have to go back to the detox place for the week so I can get in to the rehab and go right from the detox so I wouldn't be stuck going back to the streets and having any temptations ruin my start of sobriety.\n\nI got home from detox yesterday and within 5 hours was on the street living again. Went to the local salvation army shelter right now..got dome dinner atleast and s bed for he night..praying I can keep this together till this rehab has an open bed for me.\n\nSo anyway just a little check up on my life if anyone's wondering haha I'm sure no-one is but hey whatever lol love you guys hope y'all Doing well yourselves.\n\n Love, Jangles","143":"Called 1000 junkies.

I mean I'm not complaining but I can't get a benadryl or ambient or even a simple Valium but they keep handing me opiates like candy. I'm now on 10mg norco, 30mg oxy, 4mg morphine iv. And they'll probably double everything after surgery in a couple weeks but can't just give me a d damn ambient to sleep SMH.

Literally dying almost sounds better than  bring on this much pain every day. Pray this week infection don't spread by Monday to any vital organs. On the flip side the hospital gives me 100% coverage on any thing I need done thanks to community charity program there cause Medicaid denied my ass cause of my history being an IV drug user.

I haven't done a shot of dope since way earlier in the late afternoon, and I smoke cigarettes way too much I'm thinking the cigarettes have something to do with this. COPD is normal to get in my family, my grandmother just passed from it two years ago. Could it be this on setting as young as 28? Fml I really don't wanna go to the hospital, last time I was there they said I had some abnormalities and a growth it looked like on my heart, which sounds super serious obviously. I got no health insurance tho, and if I goto the hospital and strain myself going into really bad withdrawal sounds like it could worsen the problem. Anyone ever have these pains? \n\nEdit;;; went out back in the crisp morning air and breathed deep a few times and it completely went away .

It was terrible lol and of course in every nightmare\/dream I spend my whole time Tryna get dope and I finally always end up with a fat sack of fiyah and I wake up right before I get high.

He hits me up when I'm 5 mins away bitching saying if I'm not there in 2 mjns he's leaving and I'm just thinkin damn how many times have u left me sitting for 30+ mins waiting on u? He was bitching bout waiting 10 mins for me to show up but anyway I get to him an he is being a dick and sold me some straight garbage. And it was light. This never happens so idk if dude got fucked somehow on reup or was just in a really bad mood and took it out on the next person to call which was me but I was super tight. Thankfully he met me next door to another dboy of mines house and he had hmu saying he had some shit that'll\nMake me do the James brown lol. Had no money of course but called him anyway asking for a sample to try the new stuff out since he knows I middle for a lot of people and will bring him a lot of money he agrees and shows up 3 mins later with a nice bit of gun powder for me. Now I hate tar, gun powder, etc...I only like ecp but when broke and being given a free bag I'll take whatever. This shit was phenomenal lol and the best part about tar is I can usually do 2\/3 nice cotton shots out of it. So of course after I do my two shots and get home I end up getting 4 cotton washes out of these 3 cottons and each shot fucked me up as if I did a normal shot. I was amazed and I literally just did my last wash cause I finally came out f my nod and wanted to go back and surprisingly got another nice shot out of the wash and even caught a short rush. Crazy shit. Anyone else do multiple washes of their tar cottons? That's the only benefit I see in doing that shit otherwise it's powder all day long.

Oh well atleast I have a few Xanax, a bunch of soaked cottons and about .1 of fire for work left. Think I get paid in cash daily as well.! Oh how clutch that would be lol\n\nTime For an ice cream sandwich then a nap!

My stomach is beyond fucked up right now. Idc what anyone says it's not worth taking that much lope. Fuck that right in the arse. Well off to the dboy I go. Fml smh lol love u guys","170":"are the most fire thing ever when your high. I just killed a box in like 30 mins and jonesin for more. Food lion brand FTW. Shit post and a half but damn these shits r good","171":"So I'm home high chillen and I decide to ask the dboy for a spot. Call the homie to scoop and he has like no gas. We make it a mile from the dboy and we run out. I walk a mile to get gas and we fill up and then battery dies. Fucked. We get a jump and make it to the dboy. Get high and try to figure out gas. Dude gives us 2 bucks. Instead of goin home we call another dboy and get another spot haha cause junkie logic. Now we stuck in the hood outta gas freezin but we gonna do a nice shot each lol. Time to figure out the next move. Hope everyone's night is a lot smoother than ours, but atleast we high...right?","172":"Got some new basketball shorts for Christmas and they already have burn holes. Winning?","173":"Spending Christmas with the family. No fighting, no bullshit, stayed super high all day. My dumbass just finished what could have lasted me till tomorrow night cause I'm terrible with saving dope. Figure it out tomorrow right? Haha. Every year my family scratches lotto tickets together on xmas eve. I lost. Head to bed to do my last shot and my mom knocks on my door and hands me her 40$ winning ticket. Things have been good. Folks got me a new 3ds and the new Pokemon game too! Didn't expect anything but socks and boxers but they got me some presents apparently. Doubt there's anything else cool like the 3ds but I could use some new shirts without burn holes! Ran outta bogies Nd walked downstairs and saw 4 packs of cigarettes stickin outta my stocking! Lol sweet! Today's been pretty gnarly, I'm happy to be home and with all the family. Hope y'all are having a great Christmas, kwanza, Chanukah, whatever you celebrate!  Gonna get up early and open presents with everyone and then head to the hood to score some fuego and then head to my sisters for a fun day with everyone again! Hope y'all are feelin nice and noddy as well! Good night my friends!","174":"So tonight me and the homie went to cop some dope. We had like no gas at all and would just make it to the dboy and back to our homes. Well this kid hits me up asking if I could help him with a dub of some boy. I say sure but your gonna have to throw gas money cause we're literally out as wont make it. He agrees and thanks us. So first he lies about where we have to go. Saying its 1 mile off this exit...then when we get there he says oh it's like 3 miles down. So we get closer and then he goes oh wait it's actually 14 miles. I'm like really bro we aren't gonna make it, but he insists he has a gas can full of gas. So we get there, and this kid comes to the car and hops in. The gas can had maybe 2$ worth of gas in it...if that. Then he pulls out two Starbucks gift cards as payment for the dope. Wait so u got no money bro? Naw I'm sorry just 35$ on these gift cards. Wow dude ok your a piece of shit for lying about everything so I take his bag and empty 3\/4 out of it and say take it or leave it now we have to find a food lion to sell this gift card to the coin star machine. We finally find a food lion but no damn machine. Fcked. So we pull out and bam we run out of gas. Now we're broke and out of gas about 35 mins from either of our homes. Time for a 2 mile walk to find. Gas station and a kind hearted soul. Thankfully we get to one and this guy throws is 5$ for gas. Awesome then this kid asks us to buy him beer and we tell him yea but u gotta drive us to our car. Nice. Now time to find a food lion we can sell the cards at and get more gas and cigarettes before headin home. Every machine we find doesnt work. Fucked. So now we're about 2 miles from my house and my boys still 20 miles from his. Cars puttering outta gas, but we make it to my house. We brainstorm how to get him home and come up with nothing. He says fuck it he gonna go to a close gas station and try to ask someone to help him out. I really hope he made it home okay. Of course we were lookin around my garage for a full gas can I thought we had before he left and my folks come out thinking were stealing shit from the garage. Fucked. Lol tonight has been a fuckin trip from hell. Did I do something wrong to deserve all this bad karma coming my way? Fucked isn't even the word anymore this whole night has been a cluster fuck of bullshit. All because this stupid fucking kid couldn't just tell the truth, and got us all fucked up. He's lucky he didn't get knocked out for making us come 30 mins away to help him out since he was sick and he actually pulled that bhllshit. If he woulda said where he actually was we could taken a better route and saved gas, and if we knew we were getting gift cards instead of money we would of saved a few bucks for gas instead of gettin just dope. I really despise some people.its people like him that give us a bad name. Smh. End rant.\n\nTldr: junkies lie. Made us run out of gas. Buzz kill. No bogies. No Bueno. Fuck Starbucks. And fuck that kid.","175":"You don't realiZe u passed out with ur dope next to u on paper and knocked it into your pina coloda drink mix. Go to get high and realize your fucked. Fml so hard. Atleast I'm working tonight n tomorrow. Hope yalls mornin has been better than mine!","176":"I got this dope from one of my normal dboys today..it was light tan. Not thinking anything of it, I do my normal decent size shot....only 1 shot all day, it was about 2 points only. Nothing crazy or huge at all. I got the most intense rush I've ever had, then pins n needles set in, and then I fell out. Woke up 30\/40 mins later contorted in my buddies front seat with my head on the center console. He's like damn bro u been noddin hard. I'm like half awake like what's goin on? He drops me off And i hop out, go inside the crib, goto take a shit and bam fall out again for 2 hours sitting on the toilet. Thought I was dead. So I wake up hours later sitting there like wtf is up wit this shit. Go and sit down and bam I'm out again. Literally been 8 hours now and every time I sit down and relax for 2\/3 mins I'm noddin out hard as fuck. \n\nI've been doin dope for a very long time and this has never happened like this from one single shot way earlier today. If it's fentanyl it's or crazy legs cause the high I can compare to fent. Idk though I'm still nodding  off, I don't even wanna get more dope I'm still high which is super weird for me, normally even fire dope has me redosing a couple hours later.\n\nSo is there a fent analog out there with legs? Or was this possibly just some of the best most pure dope I've ever had? And I'm from NY we used to get some serious fire and this shit was a whole other level. Bright yellow clear like piss in my rig. Reeked of vinegar and tasted like dope. Hmmm","177":"This morning I wake up sick and whatnot, before I can even get up and moving around my newest dboy I met that lives around the corner from me calls me and asks if I needed anything and I say naw I'm broke and sick bro, i wish. So he says oh ite an hangs up. 3 mins later I get a text saying \"kome outside bruh\". Walk outside and he's out there and hands me a bag and says go eat some breakfast and get outta bed. Dude just gave me a free .25. Stoked! Haven't even been fuckin wit dude for long, only met him a couple weeks ago and lucked out since he lives about a 30 second walk away. Never expected him to be this cool though haha. Sorry for shitposting. Dude just put me in a good ass mood lol.\n\nAnyway it's shitty out and raining here. Sunday's suck. How's everyone else's day going so far?? Everyone be safe out there!!!","178":"Another friend died today. That's fucking 4 now this week. Wtf. Why? And this other kid left a note and went missing so if he's found dead that's 5 friends in a fuckin week. Idk what to do. This fentanyl bullshit has to stop","179":"And another good friend gone today. RIP Anthony, this shits gotta stop already too many people the past couple weeks","180":"So me an my two boys go to pickup some fire. The one kid said he hasn't been using a lot lately and been tryna get clean cause of court. Anyway we get some top notch fire and we all do a shot, we're all noddin but I notice dude I front of me in front passenger seat isn't responding to anything so I'm like oh fuck bro did he overdose? We shake him and try to wake him but no luck. Thankfully we were only down the road like 3 mins from where I'm staying and my boy I stay with had narcan. So I rush back to the crib get all the narcan and we hit him with 2mg....nothing. Fuck ok so we do another 2mg and still nothing. We call an ambulance since hospital was too far with traffic, and thankfully dude wakes up. Sheesh shit was dumb scary thought another friend was gonna die. This stuff wasn't even fentanyl either dude just had no tolerance since getting arrested and tryna stay clean. Crazy shit man narcan is a life saver.. Thank god my boy had some or else we would be burying another friend. Smh\ud83d\ude30","181":"Hope everyone had an awesome day! I had very low hopes I'd have a good thanksgiving not being with family this year and no one inviting me over but the homie u\/lolzlikeforreal and his wife made today one of the better turkey days I've had. These two have opened their home up to me and treated me like a member of their family. I owe them so much and then some, they have been the backbone to me coming out of my depression and funk, and have restored my faith in humanity. These two are some awesome human beings, and anyone who has them in their lives are blessed beyond words. We ate so much awesome food and fried my first turkey ever an it was delicious! Was able to middle up some dope so I wasnt sick all day either, they had friend coming in and out all day so we pretty much just smoked a bunch of pot and ate a shitload of delicious food him and his wife cooked. It was an awesome day to say the least. Just felt humbled by today and my latest experiences and felt the need to share before I went to sleep. I love this community, almost all of you are awesome people!! Don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise! Hope y'all had a decent day though, and if ya didn't there's always next year! Don't take the small things for granted and be in a shitty mood if your sick, just remember you could be sick and not have anyone to be around or with for the holidays. If you got people around you that care about you then your already winning. With that said good night Reddit, I love y'all!","182":"So my buddy and his wife had this awesome idea to go around selling hot dogs, coffee, and lil bags of chips to all the people standing in line. Figure we can net a nice chunk of change off that. Figured I'd also share it with y'all in case some of y'all are broke and want a semi legal depending on where u live way to make some extra money to cop or pay rent or whatever. But dogs and chips are the only thing you'll need to really buy and it's cheap considering you can sell a dog chips and a coffee for like 4\/5$ to cold desperate people that you know have money on them most likely lol and make 30\/40 sales throughout the night and your Gucci. ","183":"When your family wants nothing to do with you, and your stuck with no job, no money, and a car that's 500 miles away. I'm so beyond stressed out and depressed nothing seems to be working out for me. I've lost everything good I had. I miss my dogs, I miss being able to eat normal meals and not dollar lunchables and ramen. I'm lucky to have some friends that let me stay with them but I'm so useless I figured I'd have a job and a rented room somewhere by now. Instead everyday I just fall deeper and deeper into this depressed state. Idk what to do anymore. Heroin isn't even the problem, it's that I'm in a kind of new state and got exiled after investing all my money into a house I can't live in and now I'm left fend for myself completely screwed. I lost my best friend, and my aunt, last week. Nothing in my life is good. I kind of just wanna overdose at this point. And no I don't want attention but I got nowhere else I say anything. I'm tired of this life and see no possible outcome where I pull through and am living a normal happy life. From here I see shelters, jail, rehab, halfway houses, etc.. And then inevitably the street until I'm that guy you might give a dollar to. Fuck.","184":"So I went up to food lion to grab some food and a drink, and waiting for my homie to scoop me to go grab something. I walk out and light a cigarette and skate towards the ga station next door. This black dude covered in gold jewelry calls me over asking if I need some bud. I say nah Tryna grab dog food. He looks around and says I got that. I'm like yea whatever and he says stay right here. So I give him the benefit of doubt, and wait for like 5\/6 mins and he comes back as has me walk into this cell phone store his girlfriend or whatever is working at. He throws a bag of rocks on the table and says here ya go, take my number. Boom he lives one block over from where I'm staying at. I do the stuff and it knocks me on my ass. Completely floored it was that easy to get some dope lol I was about to have to go like 20 miles to see my normal dude but nope not anymore haha can't believe that shit happened. Can't beat it though, don't have to go very far for my dope now lol wish this happened to me when I first move here and was out lookin for plugs. Successful afternoon. Now off to a job interview! ","185":"So things have been alright. An awesome human and his wife have opened their home to me to help me get back on my feet. I cannot express my gratitude and thanks to them for all they have done for me, it's completely restored my faith in humanity. They have made this transition back on my own so much better and easier on myself but I need to get my own spot asap I hate feeling like a moocher ya kno? The position my family left me in was pretty fucky\u00ff....anyway...\n\nSo I lost a few people over the past two or so weeks. One is still fighting for his life in ICU in a coma right now. His left lung just collapsed again last night, and he had a stroke a couple nights prior. No Bueno....\n\nSo today I was walking to a job at a catering hall, was suppose to work as a server tonight. I was stoked to make some extra money and all that jazz, but course life snuck up behind me with a raging hard on, and got me again. My mom calls me for the first time since I've been out of the house. I'm thinking maybe they're gonna apologize to me....but nope of course not, so this call can only be bad news. I thought  a thousands different reasons shed call me....well apparently early this morning on her way to work my aunt was in a bad wreck and passed away. Fucked. She was like a second mother, her and her family all just moved down here with us, they lived around the corner from the house i was just kicked out of....her, my uncle, and my cousins were the closest family we have they are like brothers and sisters and my aunt and uncle are like parents, we did everything together. Hell they moved down south with us only 20 seconds away just so we'd all be together. This shit sucks, it hits like a Fukin Mack truck...why does this kind of stuff happen to the good people who deserve nothing but happiness. Such a good person, always giving and never taking. When j heard the news, I just dropped down and sat against this stores back wall and haven't moved in awhile. I'm completely like idk just broken. I just can't take all this bullshit nothing in my life has been working out no matter how hard I try and pray for help and guidance, I just get shitted on. Fml idk what to do anymore. Everyone close to me is dying, and my family doesn't even want me around. The only thing that consistently doesn't let me down is heroin. It's sad as fuck. Idk what to do anymore","186":"So I head to do some middling and pick my stuff up from my dude. Hadda drive 20 mins away but He shows up quickly and I hop back in the car and the deal is over with in like 3 minutes of showing up, so we start heading back to the crib. My dboy always puts the shit in a dollar bill even if it's bagged up he wraps it in a dollar. So I open the dollar as we're heading back and offer a huge whiff of cannabis, and look at the bill and it's a shitload of weed wrapped up in the dollar and no dope. NOOO! Fml HAha thankfully my dboy is just a stoner and made a mistake he wasn't trying to jerk me. I call him and he says oh shit that's why I can't find my bud lol. He meets back up in like 30 seconds an gives me the good stuff, and then throws another half gram in my hand and says my bad bro just take that.  Boom! Stoked! Now I'm back chillin on the nod, waiting to see how fucked the country is gonna be; Either really fucked, or Really really fucked. Lol \n\nHope everyone's election night has been a dope one! ","187":"A Serbian film? Lolzlikeforreal showed me it and it has forever scarred me. Has anyone else ever viewed this horrific film? Baby rape is a no no!","188":"As if things couldn't get worse, I get that terrible phone call from back home. My best friend has died. Was found by his brother in his bed this morning. Smh...we were the best of friends..inseparable...fuck this hit me like a freight train idk what to do or say. \nNow I have to get my ass up to NY for the wake and funeral somehow. Idk how I'm gonna make it but I really have to try...fml and on top of it another good friend is in ICU in a coma and may be a vegetable. Shit is not cool at all....both cases had to be the fentanyl analogues going around back in my home state. \n\nThis sucks. My best friend. I didn't expect that phone call to happen. So messed up. \n\nRIP Greg, my brother I love you homie ","189":"And u get that text that someone needs and then bam two more people hit you up and next thing you know your rolling around in free heron. King Ezekiel on walking dead tonight who else tuning in? Hope everyone's feeling well tonight","190":"So I take a lyft with no hopes of getting home 25 mins away to grab again and now I'm stuck in the middle of downtown lol fml no way home and the giant burrito I had for lunch is running right through me. Fml","191":"Every time I save enough shit to do a fat shot in the morning, I end up either staying up all night waiting till the sun comes up to justify doing my last shot, or sleeping and waking up at 4\/5am and doing my last shot cause fuck it I'll figure something out in a few hours for more haha. I can never just sleep all night and wake up at a normal time and do my shot around 8\/9am so I'm well till I can get a ride into town to grab more. Gotta wait till 3\/4pm for a ride into downtown, so this last .25 shot must keep me well for the next 10\/11 hours. Fml at least this dope is straight fire and will have me sleeping atleast half that time. Worst part is if I do this shot rn I haven't slept so I'll pass right out and not enjoy my high AT ALL but I'll still do it cause fuck it.\n\nAnyone else have this problem with saving their stash ? lol like it should be so simple and yet I make it  into such a hard task and never make it last 5\/6am with the last of my shit. ","192":"So I woke up and realized like always I did all my dope at 5am. Fml. Seen the marketplace and threw up these old wrestling cards and some dumb porcelain dragons and made 200$ clutch as fuck","193":"Don't you hate it when you wait 30mins in a parking lot for your dealer to show up just to tell you oh I only have half of what you needed on me my bad . The. You have to scramble and call your backup guy just to find out he had way better dope to begin with and met up with you in less than 5 mins lol fml! Hope everyone's Sunday is going good!!","194":"I've met so many people through this sub and everyone of you are pretty damn cool. Give yourselves a round of applause! ","195":"So I woke up dying. Idk why so sick considering I had 2 nice bags the night before at like 9pm. Didn't sleep all night, and restless legs kicked in around 3-4am. Fucked. Idk why so fast. So around 11am I say fuck it, I had money but no way to my dude who was busy helping his roommate do trim work at their house. So I take a lyft about 25 mins to him. Only cost 15$ pretty decent, beat a taxi or waiting for the bus and the 2 hours the bus would have taken. Get into my dudes truck, he hands me 3 bags. I start making my shot, start to draw up, and boom my fucking rig gets stuck and the plunger pops out leaving rubber in and it popped out so fast that I dropped my spoon all over my shorts. Fucked. So fucked. Just lost 2 bags. Down the drain. Dunzo. So I say fml and do my last bag so I can get relief, and head up to the Burger King where I got my cousin to scoop me up and save me the money for a ride home. I get home, and have like 3 cottons that were pretty soaked with shit. So I do em, and instantly I'm nodding out like I just shot all three of those bags at once. I get woken up to a call from another job I applied for. So that's cool a second job would be good for me to keep me busy and pockets fat. So now I'm sitting here, staring at this huge white stain on my basket ball shorts, and these restless legs are kicking back in. Literally 2 bags of dope soaked into my basketball shorts and I have no idea how I would even get it out, haha I tried to put some water on it and rub it then suck up with my syringe but he material sucks and just wouldn't let me suck anything up. This blows lol. Why are my withdrawals starting only a few hours after each shot all the sudden? I mean the past month I was on a crazy bender doing as much dope as I wanted all day and night and then went from that to nothing really since my dude has been in and out of hospital and we haven't had any jobs. Fuck man this life is too crazy too many ups and downs in such a short time I'm getting gray hairs from this stress and I'm only 27.\n\nTl;dr.  Woke up sick, took a lyft to cop. Spilled almost all my dope due to a faulty rig and me being clumsy and sick. Got relief for an hour or two and I'm back to shit. No Bueno. I need my license back","196":"So today for the first day in a couple of months I was left with no dope. Terrible, right? First word junkie problems at its finest !\n\nSo anyway, everyone I called either couldn't get anything or had no ride and I had no ride. My main dude wss in the hospital for an ulcer. I'm freaking out here!!!! What is a junkie to do? Having money and no way to fill my desire is a literal hell on earth....in my mind atleast.\n\nMy main guy finally calls and says he's out of the E.R..... Thank you lord! But oh he doesn't feel up to driving to me snd he doesn't know what to do....fml I tel him my sympathetic heel bad for me homie lines, but to no avail....sheesh! He says try and make it through till tomorrow, when he picks me up for work and he'll take care of me. I know he will too but I want relief NOW damnit!! Haha so I call him back about 2 mins later being annoying. And luckily  one of his customers that I did a favor for last week was meeting him. Homie said I'll deliver it to broseph! Thank you lord!!! He says I'll hit you up when in close! He's only 15-20 mins tops from me so I'm like cool...set my shot up and stare at my wall waiting....and waiting...and waiting...Dafuck?!\n\nSo I call him...he says oh I'm still with buddy waiting for him to give it to me....what?!? It's been 45 mins and you didn't even leave yet....omggg haha I'm screaming in my head visualizing jumping off the Empire State Building into a pool of syringes. Why, oh why is the good lord torturing me today? I continue to be an annoying obnoxious sick pal and call homie up 3, 4, 5, 8 time! Ha ok not 8 but I did call him 2 or 3 times asking if he had left. Finally the 3rd call he says I'm 10 mins away! Oh snap! Ya boy bouta get his medicineee.!!.....\n\nSo homie pulls up 12 mins later, I grab it, thank him, and sprint into my house, up my stairs, into my roo--- wtf? I'm locked out of my room! Why Jesus, why me? So after another 20 mins of picking my lock I bust through the door as if I was saving a bunch of kids from a burning building. I'm here! I'm ready! Let's go\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc89\ud83d\udc89\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc4c\n\nSo that's my story of today's peril, and had a decently happy ending! Just felt like sharing cause now I'm bored and got no one to talk to or nothing to do. Gosh I wish I had a xanax rn lol \n\nHow's everyone else's day going? Hopefully not as crazy as mine was.  Anyway, have fun y'all and be safe! ","197":"So my dboy drops me off for the night, and I don't take anything home with me cause I thought I had saved a .3 for tonight in my lil stash spot at home. Dboy pulls away and I'm walking inside, get into my room and sit on my bed and then it dawns on me! I fucking shot that .3 in a daze at 330am last night cause I'm a complete moron. Fml. So I had about 5, 5mg hydros and 4, 5mg roxies. Ate the hydros and the sniffed the roxies 20 mins later the. Made a decent cotton shot with about 4\/5 cottons. What are my chances that those pills will do ANYTHING for me? It's been about 40 mins since I ate the hydros and still don't feel much of anything but I just did the cotton shot 15 mins ago...reckon I'll catch a nod? Or should I just take some diphenhydramine and try to pass out? Is it worth staying up for any kind of buzz? I have a decent tolerance for Opiates...I do about .2-.4 in a shot give or take (2-4 bags), and use about a gram give or take a day....cmon pills work your magic!!!! \n\nIs it worth staying up? Will I miraculously catch a buzz and nod in a lil bit?\n\nDamn! I wish I had a Xanax or some weed right about now!","198":"Ugh. So I just wrote this post out, and went to post it, and the damn thing says this sub doesn't allow text posts? Dafuck? Well try it again. Herewegooo...\n\nOk. So this has happened to me in the past and never thought much of it. But now since joining up to this sub, of what feels like thousands upon thousands if doppelg\u00e4ngers of my addict self, I think someone should have an answer for me.\n\nSo after I do my shot, while the rush is ringing my bells, some dope will give me this weird \"taste\" of sorts, in the back of my throat. I guess you'd say it's a taste, though its very faint and in the back of my throat only. It's strange. It's rare that it happens, I know that it's from whatever the dope is cut with. It's always different tasting depending on the dope, and the size of my shot. It just happened again after my last shot. \n\nThis dope I'm doing right now has some gross cut in it, it's super bitter tasting, but a completely different taste in my throat during my rush, and I actually have to cook it a bit in a spoon just to draw it up without any of the gross shit in it. Which is very rare for me, I NEVER have to cook my ecp usually. It's really good dope though don't get me wrong, just whatever idiot had it at whatever point decided to use some unorthodox cut and mucked it up big time, it's leaves some gross plaster looking hard mush in my spoon once I'm done drawing up, and my cotton is hard as a rock after 5 minutes. Pretty fucked up that I'm even still shooting it into my veins after seeing that lol. But a junkies gonna junk.\n\nSo has anyone else had this weird taste or whatever you wanna call it? Any input would be appreciated! Thanks!","199":"Man, I just wrote this long post about this and then exited out of the app and it disappeared. So I'm gonna rewrite it but maybe shorter. We'll see. \n\nSo I was doing a job replacing 2 AC units at my house. So me and my boss finished the job, and we were waiting for his buddy to drop off frion cause we ran out. So my stupid moronic ass decided to do a shot while we waited. But instead of being smart and doing it in the comfort and privacy of my own room or bathroom, I decided to do it in the work truck in my driveway.\n\nSo I'm out there and I'm mixing my shot up and my boss says don't worry buddy I got my eyes peeled for ya. Cool. So I should be good I'm almost finished anyway. Next thing I know my moms walking outside and my boss says put it away buddy your mom! Your mom! So I get it down quick enough and hide it all, but turns out my dad decided to look out the upstairs window and somehow was at a perfect angle to see just the passenger side of the truck. I was bent over sitting down where I thought no one could so, but I guess I was wrong.\n\nSo my mom says come inside right now! I say what why?!? And she says you know why come in right now!! And I open the door and step out while saying idk what your trying to say here, and boom my cap of the rig was on my lap and it fell off my lap right by my moms foot as I got out. Fucked. Great. Dunzo. Worst part was they saw me doing this while I was sitting next to my boss. So now they're skeptical as fuck. \n\nSo now I'm standing in my kitchen wit my folks, and my boss and their just talking about another job we need done, and writing out the cheque. As soon as he leaves, I'm sure I'm in for some bitching about it all. I was so good, months now they've thought I was sober. All ruined cause of one stupid ass move on my part. Fml. \n\nI mean shit, I'm 27. I work everyday. I don't ask my parents for shit. Hell they owe me $24,000 that I lent them over a year ago when they were hurting. I mean I don't really bother anyone with my use anymore. I stay to myself, I goto work, come home and sleep then repeat. It's ridiculous that I have to deal with anyone telling me how to live. I understand  don't wanna see me overdose or die, but this is my choice I know the risks and have known the risks for the last 8 years of heroin use and 10+ of other opiates. All I ask is to be left alone and let me do my thing. Is that too much to ask? It's sad that when I go out I have to worry about my mom scavenging through my room looking for shit and clues to my use. I have no privacy. It's fucked.  Idk I had to vent. ","200":"So me and my guy are working and we thought his plug would be ready around 10am...the we call and he says about an hour, we give him 2 hours and call at 12...no bueno. He says at 3pm his delivery will be in for sure. Fuck. 3 more hours? I'm screaming in my head. Thinking so hard how I'm going to get through the next 3 hours even though it's not really a long time, but when your sick and expected to have stuff 2 hours prior it makes you a tad crazy. \n\nSo me and my dboy\/boss are sitting in his driveway bullshittin, and he says so how we gonna get you feeling well till 3? I say idk man I'm screwed got no money on me, and the other people I can call aren't around now...fuck. So he makes a call or two and next thing I know we're at an ATM he's taking money out and then driving to another dboys place so he can buy me a 40 to hold me over. Who does that???? Dude spent his own money just to help me get well till his stuff was ready to be picked up. This dude is a blessing. Never had a dealer that gave a shit about me in anyway at all let alone go out of their way to buy me a couple points to hold me over. Back in NY my dboy woulda just said tough shit, wait till 3. This is southern hospitality at its finest.\n\nHe did this yesterday too, bought me a 40 when we found out his plug wouldn't be liquid till today. So over two days he's been dry he spent $80 of his own money to keep me well till he would be good again. Granted we work together and he wants me able to work, and I sell a lot of H for him during the workday. I never expected him to come out of pocket like that, at all. He's a good dude for real, doesn't expect anything in return except my friendship which is s rare quality in humans these days especially in this scene. \n\nAnyway just felt like sharing while I wait now for 3pm to roll around. Feeling normal again, no more sweating and restless legs thankfully. \n\nHow's everyone else's day going so far? Any other lucky junkies out there today? I'd thank junkie Jesus but this was all my boss no junkie Jesus at all, so thanks to well let's call him Fred. Thanks \"fred\".!","201":"Okay so I been searching for a new spot to register a good shot, and I feel this nice lil guy on my left arm. So I stick needle in, and pull back and instantly register. As I'm plunging said shot in, I get this warm slightly burning sensation in that spot, so I stop shooting it in and pull back again to make sure I wasn't missing and draw in blood again, I repeat those steps a couple times before just saying fuck it and plunging it In before my blood coagulates. Everything was fine afterwards for the most part. Now this was around 7\/8pm...I just fixed up my bedtime shot and after poking around I end up back at my friend. So i stick her in, draw blood instantly(miracle!!). I start to plunge and I get the same warm burning sensation only stronger, I figure it's not gonna stop so I plunge it all in cause why not right? After I pull needle out, i still have the slight burning feeling and my arm is warm. I can't explain how my arm feels, it doesn't hurt but it feels like idk lol warm and weird it's hard to explain. I know i didn't miss cause i got an instant rush, and no bubble on my arm or reaction from missing. So what caused this?? I keep getting muscle twitches too since I hit. Artery?....Idk should I not use this vein anymore? If so, that Sucks cause this vein was a winner. What caused that burning pain? Thanks for any answers or input given!!","202":"I'm sure many of you have this problem as well. But over the past 10 days I wasn't able to take a shit to save my life. Normally after 4\/5 days I'll have a bowel movement but this time it just wasn't happening. I was using a lot of heroin though a lot more than normal over the past few weeks so that was obviously the cause. But anyway today I took a break to make myself start withdrawals just so I would be able to shit. I finally did thankfully cause I was about to give up and get high. My boss just dropped me off a nice bag so I was so tempted to just give in and stay constipated but I have it one last shot and it worked. My stool was huge and extremely hard I felt like I was shitting out rocks. It kinda hurt to get out I was pushing like I was giving birth lol my face was red and I had veins popping out of my forehead and neck pushing so hard. But my question was there was some blood in my stool when I wiped there was some red on the toilet paper. I was guessing it was from the stool being so deprived of water and making it hard and hard to get out it probably made a small tear or cut. Is this normal or is this something I should get checked out? A few years ago I had blood in my stool and I went to the hospital and I had an ulcer. This was a lot less blood and my stomach didn't hurt like when i had the ulcer. So is this normal?  ","203":"Is it just me, or is the absolute best place to boot up a nice shot and then smoke a cigarette sitting on the toilet taking a shit? Man I'm sitting here right now and I just thought \"wow this is so peaceful and serene\" I can't think of anywhere else I could peacefully do a shot and just have \"me\" time to contemplate life and what have you.

Well I was confused cause when looking up my name on our counties court website it said I had a failure to appear and the. It showed a new court date for September 23rd but didn't say anything about a bench warrant. I have been so paranoid about getting pulled over here in NC and getting extradited back to NY since all day for work we drive around to service calls and spend most of the day on the road so chances for a traffic stop are high. Having my boss be my dboy and our work truck being the trap truck as well didn't help me paranoia. So today I called the courts back in NY just to double check about my warrant and they transferred me to the warrant bureau. And to my surprise I have no warrants or anything under my name back in my old county. Even the warrant bureau the guy I talked to said it was weird cause there should be a bench warrant out for me if I missed my court date 10 days ago. He said he didn't understand why I didn't have one but he said it was my lucky day lol. So why do I not have a bench warrant yet? Has this happened to anyone else before? I'm sure eventually I'll have one but it's a huge sigh of relief to know if I get pulled over I can give my real name to the officer and not worry about getting locked up. I'm extremely happy cause now I can go get my NC I.D. And get my drivers license again down here with no worries for now. Thank you junkie Jesus amen.","205":"Oh. My. God. I cannot stop tweezing out hairs from my body and or picking at non existent pimples or black heads when I'm high. It's so annoying but I cannot stop doing it the minute I pick up these damn tweezers I don't stop lol. Every tiny lil hair I see has to be removed. And then when they start to grow back in, I go even harder trying so hard to tweeze out these tiny tiny minuscule little hairs starting to grow out. Why do I do this? Does anyone else have this OCD problem? It's only when I'm high. I just lit a cigarette and had it hanging from my mouth, the whole thing one long ash cause I didn't smoke it cause I was so focused on tweezing out these hairs on my stomach lol. WTF?! And then the \"pimples\" that's 90% of the time aren't even there I can see a small dot on my face and will rip at it until it becomes a blemish. I thankfully stopped doing this to my face besides here and there when I actually see a blackhead pop up or something but I do it to my shoulders(in highschool I had acne on my shoulders and back) and I almost make it all come back all over by pinching these little spots trying to see something pop out, and nothing ever does lol. I'll do it until I see clear pus come out that's only from irritating the area so much. This is the only thing I HATE about getting high and being bored. I start to search around for things on my body to destroy hAha. Please tell I'm not alone? ","206":"June 14th::: \n      My buddy calls me up and asks if I'm down to go out boosting one last time. We had a successful 4 month run. I knew I was about to move in 2-3 weeks. I thought this was a bad idea, but the thought of a nice fat shot was already implanted in my head. So being a junkie I said yeah fuck it lets go. So we head to Home Depot, and I go inside. Walk around fill my cart with a few things and throw my expensive 2 items I was gonna take off with in the front of my cart. I do this all very quickly and go by the register where there is a line. I Act as though I'm getting onto the line, and pickup my two expensive items and take off towards the door. Right as I get to the outside and I feel the sun on my face, I'm fucking tackled and there's 2 dudes already outfront waiting for me and they get on top of me. I try fighting them off me but to no avail. I'm a sick junkie trying to fight off 3 jacked security\/lost prevention guys. \n\nFucked. \n\nSo now all these thoughts of regret are filling my head as I'm being walked through the store with cuffs on, all these customers looking at me in disgust. Damn.... Then I realize I have a needle in my pocket. Damn what else could go wrong.... So they bring me to the back room and start asking me all these questions. What's your name? Who were you with? Are you a drug addict? Why did you go for this specific item? Etc.... They say listen we gotta have the cops come. They probably won't take you to the precinct though they usually write a citation for you to goto court and let you go from here. But my dumbass left my wallet with I.d in my buddies car so they were deff bringing me down to the precinct. Anyway they bullshit with me and tell me the whole everyone makes a mistake man it's not the end of the world. Yea whatever you say boss. \n\nThis whole time, I was slowly and quietly taking my needle out of my pocket and got it stashed under this plastic seat between the metal bars of the chair and the plastic. Cops show up. Take the cuffs from Home Depot off me and put their cuffs on. Ask for my I.d. And I tell em I didn't have it. Stand up lets go they say. Fuck me man. I stand up and start to walk and the Home Depot security gets up too and starts to walk behind me and accidentally the guy kicks the chair and my needle falls out from under it. FUCK. They all turn their heads and look at the syringe sitting right there. Fuck fuck fuck. Oh look what we have here the cop says and looks at me with fire in his eyes. Lol damn man can anything else go wrong? \n\nNowhere to go from here but up, I guess lmao fml. So they book me at precinct and set 50$ bail luckily and my buddy comes through and bails me out so I didn't have to call my folks with another help me out I'm in jail bullshit calls. Being the junkie I am, the minute I get bailed out, I head to my dboys house and beg for a spot telling him what had happened and thankfully he hooked me up with a half gram. All my troubles went away till the next morning.\n\nSo now this is where I'm at, they gave me a court date for August 12th in NY which was 2 days ago and I'm in NC and had no way of going to that court date at all. \n\nNow my question is how long till they issue a bench warrant? Will New York come and get me if I run into the cops down here in NC? I know NC won't extradite someone but idk if NY will.  Is a petit larceny and a hypodermic needle charge important enough to NY to extradite me back there? How long will NC hold me in jail if they don't wanna come get me for it? And how fucked do you think I am in terms of jail time from NY if they do come and get me? I do have prior offenses. Just beat a possession charge like 3 months ago. And before that I have 2 dwi charges that I did 8 months for back in 2010. no felonies on record thankfully though. What do y'all think? Need some serious input here. \n\nI couldn't find any websites I could finding i had a warrant out for me yet. No free ones at least. Any help in somewhere I could look up my warrant situation at would be helpful as well. Thanks community for any input y'all have!","207":"so I just replied to a comment on that picture of the naked wife with the dope cut into lines on her ass and crotch. Anyway I asked how I could IV off a girls body jokingly...and the thought popped into my head, how amazing would busting a nut and doing your shot at the same exact time would be? IV rush and orgasm might be the best feeling in the world lmao...you'd have to do it on your first shot though cause I doubt you'd bust a nut if you were already on the nod. Anyone ever do this? Lmao now I'm curious I need to go find me a girl and experiment.","208":"unknowingly being a heroin mule going through airport security snd being caught??? im watching that airport security show, and i just remembered an episode where supposedly the person had no clue his bag was loaded by a dick friend. of course his buddy got away fine but this guy got FUCKED. it was another country like phillipines (sp?) or some asian country i forget which one. and penalty for smuggling heroin like that could be death over there if not just life in their prison with chance of extradition to USA after like 4-5 years give or take. i could only imagine being an addict, being sick and trying to smuggle what you think is a home run snd being caught. sheesh man i would be so sick just knowing my life is over and the next month of withdrawal and stress could very well give me a heart attack or something. fuck man a dude just got busted for 5 kilos of coke in columbia. crazy how we can sit home snd watch these peoples entire lives be completely ruined trying to bring drugs into america. the very drugs that could possibly one day go up our noses or in our veins lol....anybody on here ever have a close call like that? or get caught up in some serious shit like that? and i dont mean a few bundles im talking bricks. thankfully we got DNMs so its really pointless to try and accomplish something so risky unless your in debt to a cartel and being forced or t happens unknowingly to you by some asshole your with .  sorry for the shit post I'm just high watching this show thinking how fucking shitty these people must feel as they're testing the substances they have hidden in their luggage knowing they're about to go through HELL.

Say you only have 2 or 3 bags for the night, you know you dont fall asleep till 4-6am. Would you rather do all the bags at once, and get a nice high, or only do half so you have another shot for later, or do most of it and save just a tiny bit along with your cotton so you can just do a baby shot before you crash or for the morning? I face this dilemma constantly and just boggled my mind on what to do again just now. Tonight i said fuck it and did all 3 at once but squirted the tiniest bit back on my cotton so i could do a morning shot for the sake of shooting something. Whats your guys input on this? is it even worth saving that tiny shot just for mental satisfaction of doing a shot and the possibility of prolonging your withdrawals? Or is one better off just doing all of it so you get to enjoy the high, or do half now half later to stretch it out and not get a great high but save yourself from feeling w\/d's for a lil while.....ehhh idk probably consider this a shit post but when i have like no money and can only afford a few bags i go through this problem. Any input is cool..trolls do not need to reply lol Thanks!!\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udc79\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udca4\ud83d\udc89\ud83d\udc89\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8","211":"hows everyones tuesday so far??? im bout to grab finally and isolate myself in my dungeon lol. anybody see suicide squad yet? i found a bootleg on reddit it was alright. sorry for the shit post im just passing time till my dboy pulls up","212":"man im an asshole. i was really sick and broke and i found the keys to my parents safe, and like the scumbag junkie i Am i stole a necklace and pawned it to get well. i hate being such a scumbag especially to the only people who give a shit about me. being sick just sucks so hard. it also sucks i lent my folks 24k 2 years ago when they were down on there luck and they havent been able to pay me back and it was literally my life's savings. i helped buy our new house in north carolina and try to tell them how unbearable being sick is and with just moving here not working yet i really could use some of my money back, i feel like a dick even asking but they just say no youll just shoot it all away. so im stuck either be in unbearable pain or pull that scumbag move. anyone else ever get into such a shitty dilemma? i hate being the black sheep ","213":"anyone else love watching dbz or dbs now whole nodding out??? episode 54 is out!! who else is watching the raw episode tonight with me??","214":"Hellow fellow nodders. mainly a lurker to the group here, but had a weird experience.

I did a bag and a half and half and cant even keep my head up, im nodding so damn hard its unreal. Its the same batch of ecp hes been getting so i know quality is the same, but why is it that this lil shot has me so wrecked? normally when i di my first shit after being in withdrawal i barely feel the high and just get well. But for some odd reason im so wrecked i dont even wanna do the rest of my shit which for me is unheard of lol I usually would do it all and be pissed by mornjng, but not tongiht....has this ever happened to anyone else? why is it that this shot has been so effective and strong? in my 8 years of use I NEVER had this happen after being in w\/ds for so long.

I shoulda got us both to stop cause I've never had a real love jn my life. And I wanna marry this one. But I'm hoping her mom isn't brainwashing her into leaving me.

He's done this to prevent me from going to the ER and it's working really well. Aside from 1 ER visit that led to a hospitalization last month, I haven't stepped into an ER in 2 months. \n\nThat's a big deal for me.\n\nSometimes I do want to abuse those 15mg tablets but knowing they are there for emergencies is outweighs my desire to abuse them.

All she knows is that Im on the Subutex.\n\nWhat I've been doing is living my best life to the best of my ability and using the Narcotics Anonymous program to help me improve as a person even though I'm not 100% clean in their eyes, I still feel there are parts of the program that I can and will benefit from.","217":"The title is basically the vibe I got from my doctor's office this morning.  \n\nI'm absolutely pissed off. \n\nI work 45minutes from where I live and I don't drive. So, I'm relliant on rides and Uber\/Lyft usually I dont mind this. \n\nExcept I accidentally left my Subutex this morning at home. 45 minutes away. Ugh. \n\nMy first thought was good news, I fill my script week by week and pay out of pocket for it. I'll just call CVS and have them transfer the script over from the CVS 45 minutes away to the CVS down the block from me and be fine. \n\nCVS down the block was surprisingly helpful in this situation. The pharmacist apologized because subutex is schedule 3 they cant pull it from one CVS to another but my doctor could call it in and have a days worth of it filled electronically if they're FDA approved. \n\nSo, I call my doctors office. I tell them what's up and the receptionist is more than nasty to me. \n\nI must've begged and pleaded with her for 10 minutes asking if anything could be done, if another doctor in the office could help. I asked her what her suggestion was. She told me to go to the ER or Urgent Care. I asked if that would get me kicked out of their office for filling with a different doctor. She told me that it probably would. \n\nFinally, I told her, \"Look Dr. X Wants to keep me OUT of the ER and if I dont come up with a solution you're asking me to get fired. Over something that could be solved with a phone call to the CVS down the road. I would like to speak with Dr. X regarding this matter now.\" She told me he was with patients and I told her I would wait on hold till he had a break. \n\nShe finally transferred me to his assistant.  I told her the same thing I told the receptionist. That I made a huge mistake, my bad, I accepted responsibility for it, but if she thought getting me fired over it when they had the power to solve the issue was an effective way to help someone rebuild their life and recover. Especially considering I'm not asking them to call in a months worth or a weeks worth. I'm asking them to call in 1days worth. \n\nI guess that did it because she had the doctor call the CVS down the road from me and I'll be picking it up on my lunch break. God willing. \n\nI cannot believe how much hassle that was. I'm floored by the treatment of that receptionist and I just think we all need to be treated with a little more respect.

I still use them to this day to help my pain, I just don't get that high sensation I used to. So, if you're a heavy H user you might not notice anything, but if you are in withdrawals, new to recovery or craving in recovery, they might be the solution you need.\n\n# What are Binaural Beats?\n\nBinaural beats therapy is an emerging form of soundwave therapy in which the right and left ears listen to two slightly different frequency tones yet perceive the tone as one.\n\nThe binaural auditory beat that a person hears is the difference in frequency between the left and the right ear and should be at frequencies lower than 1000 hertz (Hz) for the brain to detect the binaural beat.\n\nFor example, if the left ear registers a tone at 200 Hz and the right at 210 Hz, the binaural beat heard is the difference between the two frequencies \u2014 10 Hz.

It's totes legal.\n\nPredicated on the notion that binaural brainwaves are responsible for every conceivable state of consciousness, the tracks supposedly sync brainwaves to make you feel fine.

Lengthy exposure to sounds at or above 85 decibels can cause hearing loss over time. This is roughly the level of noise produced by heavy traffic.\n\nBinaural beat technology could be a problem if you have epilepsy, so you should speak to your doctor before trying it. More research is needed to see if there are any side effects to listening to binaural beats over a long period of time.\n\nSide Note: It's Not Recommended to Drive After Listening to Binaural Beats because it does impair you to some extent.

I ultimately got off the dope that way but my physical pain is enormous and the only thing that could destroy my recovery so, I'm now doing it with Subutex onboard. Although admittedly I regret getting on it and take the bare minimum to stay out of withdrawals from it. Simply because I mentally cannot handle withdrawals again. I've also been staying clean with the help of NA although I do feel like with the Subutex I'm not 100% honest. At the same time, my sponsor knows about it and I do what I can.\n\nI stay motivated by all the good things that have happened to me since I started this journey. I'm engaged, have a great job, and deal with less pain day to day than I ever did when I was using, so go figure. Although, there are days where a painkiller would really help and there have been days in recovery where I've needed it for things like spinal surgery.\n\nFor me, the best thing about being off of it is living life again. I have more energy, less pain, and feel more fulfilled. I thought I was living when I was using but, little did I know I think I was actually dying.","220":"This is sort of opioid-related. I just need to talk and rant with my r\/opiates fam because you guys understand it all more than anyone.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe other night I went to the ER. I was in EXTREME pain. More so than usual. I normally NEVER ask for opiates anymore because they don't give them to me and I don't really want them, I, however, always expected in an extreme situation they'd treat the human, not the addiction. \n\nWhelp. \n\nI was wrong.\n\nAt the ER I told the doctor I seriously needed pain relief that it was way beyond what I could physically cope with, that I need to be treated with dignity and properly. She tells me that she can look into getting me another Subutex dose. I tell her no, I really need a legitimate opioid right now. She goes, \"how about Torodol?\" So, I get that, and a little later I ask her why she can't give me a dose of pain medications for legitimate flares. She gives me a pamphlet that says, \"We don't give IV medications for flareups of chronic pain, but we do give oral medication instead.\" So, I asked for something oral and she told me no and walked off.\n\nI turned to the nurse and stated: \"All that does is make people want to use heroin.\"\n\nThe nurse then says: \"T***hen that's good because it's on you and not the doctor and the doctor's license.***\"  So I ask about the oath to do no harm and the nurse tells me he's not going to argue it with me.\n\nIt's so fucking disgusting.\n\nIDK The point of this ... I just needed to rant. I get it that I'm in recovery and that I'm not actively using, aside from Subutex, I'm just frustrated and angry that in legitimate situations I'm treated less than dog crap all because I made the decision to get off day to day opiates.","221":"I need to take a quick moment here to say and acknowledge the fact that I'm EXCEPTIONALLY proud of myself.\n\n# 160 Days Clean\n\nSince a falling out with my sponsor around 90 Days Clean, I haven't been attending Narcotics Anonymous very much. However, I'm happy to report that I am still 160 Days Clean. I'm really excited about it. I'm almost 6 months clean and that's a big deal for me. My current support network is my Fiance, family, select friends, &amp; my therapist.\n\n# Employment\n\nI used to be roommates with one of my friends and we had a falling out. However, after our falling out I offered an olive branch and acted as a reference for her so she could at least find employment after I had to kick her out of our apartment. \n\nI've seen her a few times at functions with friends and have always been corgel with her. To be fair when she left the apartment I had paid 3 months worth of her rent, so she owed me big time.\n\nWell, sure enough 3 weeks ago I found out she was looking for someone to replace her at the non-profit she was working at. Despite knowing nothing about Accounts Payable, my friend talked me up to her boss as well to the CEO of the non-profit. I interviewed on a Monday and started that Wednesday.\n\nSo, my old roommate actually came through on her word that she'd make it up to me. She really out did herself. This is my first grown up job and while the work is NOTHING I'm passionate about, it's an easy job that I love. Especially with the down time I get. Today I was so caught up on everything, I got paid to just hang out and play on my phone.\n\nOh &amp; my job pays in money. So, i'm slowly digging myself out of debt from my gambling and drug addictions.\n\n# My Health\n\nIt's been 35 days since I last went to the ER which, is really excellent for me. Sure there have been days where i could've gone into the ER, but overall, I'm doing tons and tons better. I'm pushing through the distress of my vomiting too. Like my first day at work I vomited in the work bathroom 5-7 times. I seriously should've gone to the ER, I normally would've gone, but not messing up on my first day was really important to me. My friend was training me and covered for me - so no one but her knew i was sick that day.\n\nAnyway, I'm excited things are getting better.","222":"When I first joined r\/opiates i was seeking advice on how to deal with my brother's death from a heroin overdose.

I used to hate it and think everyone there was a delusional brainwashed religious nut job who took everything to the extreme. After getting involved in it, I discovered it is actually a super useful program that provided me with a new way of looking at life. I was stunned by how much fun the fellowship of NA is and am super lucky to have a strong fellowship where I live.\n\nAs for the religious side of NA here is a little summary of what NA really is when it comes to your higher power or religious beliefs: [https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/5V6xKnJ.jpg](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/5V6xKnJ.jpg)\n\nFor instance, for me, my \"higher power\" is this concept that you get back what you put out into the world. If you put a lot of good in - you'll ultimately get good back. I take negative experiences as, \"not as bad as I think they are\" and \"a learning experience,\" it really helps me cope with day to day life and so much higher power is simply the idea that I am not in control of what happens, but I am capable of making good &amp; healthy decisions.\n\n# 90 days is a lot but at the same time, it isn't!\n\nLet's see, in the last 90 days, my life has changed dramatically...\n\n* I got Engaged\n* I moved into a larger 1 Bedroom for cheaper than my studio!

Having gotten the chance to see how well my life can and is turning out makes me so happy that I was never successful in any suicide attempts or acted on any rash thoughts. I was killing myself slowly though. With narcotics. Which I am now off of and it feels so good.\n\nHere's all that happened:\n\n1. I got ENGAGED to my boyfriend after 1 year\n2. I got off of my prescription narcotic medication\n3. I paid off $10,000 worth of debt\n\nWhile it is \"only\" three accomplishments, there's a lot that goes into each one. Especially getting off of the narcotic medication. That was a big deal and quite painful to do in the first place let alone maintain it.

I'm really proud of him right now.","227":"Hey r\/opiates ... 8 years ago today my brother died of a heroin overdose. He was 20 years old. His shit was mixed with fentanyl and it killed him. Not to mention he OD'd and was narcan'd 2 nights before his death. I miss him terribly. It's really hard for me without him. We were just growing out of that \"teenage I hate you\" phase and into respectable adults. His death rocked my world and still does. Anyway, yeah I wanted to share.","228":"My doctor recommended the Butrans Patch, but it needs to go through prior authorization with my insurance and that can take up to two weeks if not longer.\n\nSo in the meantime, he scripted me 8mg pills of Subutex he told me to cut them down to quarters and start there.  He wrote for a two week supply 2x\/day so 30 pills of 8mgs, but my insurance only covers 7 days worth so I got 14 pills instead. \n\nLuckily I'll be cutting them into halves and fourths so I won't need to get more than '7 days worth' each month until we can petition the insurance and get them to either approve the Butrans patch or whatever. If I like the Subutex I can work with him to stay on that versus the Butrans patch, but he's totally willing to give me a hand with everything which is helpful. \n\nIf I get on the Subutex regularly and we can get the insurance to allow more than '7 days worth' then I can stockpile it and never be truly out unlike what would happen with my regular oxycodone.\n\nAlso, I'm debating not telling my sponsor about this. I don't feel like being judged in NA for needing this right now, but I know I need the program itself to get better overall.","229":"I'm 28-Days sober and really just want to break down and get opiates.

Spent $200 on it to avoid the ER\/Hospital. It helped a little but less than 24hrs hours later I was vomiting at 4am-8am six times. All bile greenish\/yellowish and foamy. It really upset my entire stomach. I got to the ER at 9am and wasn't seen till 11am. After that, I was in the ER from 11am - 6pm before being moved up to a room. \n\nNo pain medications. There was a request to have pain management at the hospital see me for non-narcotic management which may or may not involve ketamine, but they didn't see patients past 5pm for that so I was SOL with that.\n\nAt this point I've been writhing in pain for days. I tried to go through the appropriate channels and have my nurse call my doctors to prescribe me something just to get through to the morning. None of them would because GI had a massive note in my chart not to give me pain medication.\n\nLike I know pain medication isn't the answer but sitting at a solid 8 of pain for so many hours gets wearing and I finally lost it. I called up my internist and was like, \"what am I supposed to do here?!\" then, my GI called me back because I had left a very exasperated message on his voicemail and was all like \"we don't want to lead you back to drugs.\" I was just like again, \"what choice do I have? Will a one time dose really get me back into or onto the drugs?\" He eventually conceded and was all \"fine one dose.\" \n\n&amp; I got it.\n\nPlus, it worked - did it's job. Helped break the pain cycle and I don't think I need anymore of the narcotic. I'm just sick of walking around in a 6 pain score and then being treated badly when i'm in an 8+ because I made the decision to get off the narcotics on my own. \n\nIDK\n\nShitpost.","233":"This update is really just to **THANK** this community *so much*.

The first one gave me a package of resources to call for the withdrawal\/suicidality, and the second one told me they thought  I was lying about suicide and since I had, had an evaluation 10 days before (where they really should've hospitalized me) that I wasn't eligible for a new psych evaluation.\n\nI was beyond devastated and nearly got hit by a car over it because I flung myself into traffic hoping to get hit. The police were called and they tried to reason with the ER but again all the ER did was print out paperwork for me to call myself and wouldn't call psych. Even with police involvement. I kept saying I just need help and they kept saying that I didn't meet the criteria for suicide and that they would not give me opiates. I repeated that I just wanted to withdraw safely with my suicidality and chronic illness it wasn't safe to do it outpatient. \n\nSome 25-year-old doctor whose ego was way bigger than his reasoning skills just said no and referred me to another ER.\n\nI got home slept 4hours and then decided to go see a doctor I trust - my hematologist - he helped me with IV meds for that day and right after my appointment with him went to the 3rd hospital. The ER there was great. They helped the withdrawal immensely with clonidine, 1mg Ativan 50mg Benadryl 4mg Zofran, 30mg Toradol, and so forth that I slept like a baby for a little bit.\n\nThey decided to hospitalize me on the psych unit there 72-hour hold. They didn't allow IVs on this unit and I might as well have been going cold turkey because I kept vomiting up the oral medication they gave me. I got very little out of that hospitalization. about 60 hours in they broke the hold early &amp; I revisited their ER just to stabilize my situation.\n\nNow here I am \n\n4days and 5 hours since I last used. I'm out of the woods withdrawal wise, but now everyone wants me to go to a 30day rehab. I'm very much so against that. I'll do an IOP but not inpatient\/residential and I think it'll work for me because they'll be able to work around any work schedule I may have. I think it'll work out well. IOPs are typically covered insurance wise whereas 30-day stays are not and half the reason I want to so many ER places is that we were trying to do it covered by my insurance all the detox places would've cost us $2,000 and up.\n\nAnyway, I'm off the drugs again (YAY!) but I'm in incredible amounts of pain.

I'm thinking about getting into more regular counseling again, picking up biofeedback again, seeing about doing mindfulness and picking up a job again because I really need income again. My finances are a mess and I think that's adding stress to my situation.","244":"I don't know what went wrong. I don't know why I can't cope, just that I can't anymore. I ran out of medication 2 weeks early and let my pain specialist a voicemail. Frantically tried to reach him for day and no response. Decided to just go through with the withdrawal cold-turkey and but even stopped by his office on Friday to see if he was there to at least leat help me through this but, \"no he just left for the day\" is the answer I got.\n\nSo I go downstairs to call a lyft and get home. lyft shows up and the driver asks how I am, I give him a way to honest answer: \"Not fucking great, I just want to get home\" he goes, \"I don't take negativity in my car get the fuck out.\" I'm like \"WTF\" but  throw my bag out he passenger window and he aggressively gests out-out of the car to drag me out IDK I check the car to make sure my stuff is out my cell phone falls to the ground he stomps on it, we start yelling and getting into it when I blow.\n\nI dart and run across 6 lanes of active busy rush hour traffic yelling and hoping someone hit me. somehow, I get all the way across and my stuff is still on the other side so I figure  I'd go play in traffic again and I run across 6 lanes again and somehow make it safely across. \n\nI hear sirens. I figure they're for me so I book it up to my other doctor's office (not pain management) who I figure will give me a hand and advise me he does. I end up going to a psychiatric based hospital that doesn't admit me for psych reasons because they feel my actions are very pain driven. \n\nSo here I am now feeling depressed as fuck and hospitalized for medical reasons not knowing what to do or think.","245":"Anyway around and wanna chat? I'm trying to get sober, but it's so fucking hard with all the pain issues I'm dealing with. I'm motivated, but I cracked a bit earlier today and now I feel super shitty.","246":"In 1hr 15min from now, I'll be sober for 72hrs I did [find a stash of dilaudid](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/8l82ci\/60_hrs_sober\/) that I'm gonna hold onto for now but haven't used it. \n\nI don't exactly want to flush them because treating flares at home with 2mg of Dilaudid is a lot preferable to treating full-blown flares in the hospital with IV meds. \n\nSo far I've shown great restraint. \n\nI'm at my hematologist's office. Getting IV Fluids, and hopefully some Ativan and Torodol too. Working on asking the right people here for the meds I need. I broke protocol and hit up the guy closest to the doctor here because fuck I need the medications badly.\n\nI'm hoping this time my sobriety lasts. I can't keep putting myself through the hell of withdrawal.","247":"It looks like I\u2019m headed for withdrawal land. It\u2019s been 8 hrs since my last dose. Ran out of prescription pills and money. It really sucks, but if my guy doesn\u2019t get to me tomorrow, I may follow through on the W\/D\u2019s. I\u2019m really pissed about it, but at the same time it might not be a bad thing. My tolerance was becoming unmanageable and I really rather not be on the pills. The only issue\/problem I\u2019ll have is when I flare up. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m going to do then, but I\u2019m gonna have to stay away from opiates. Last time PAWS and a Flare is what caused my relapse and descent back into this hell hole. So it might be nice to get out of it. I\u2019m just conflicted. Any thoughts?","248":"So, back in November, I got clean. It lasted 90 days, just short of 100 before I had a pancreatic flare and ended up hospitalized again. They administered pain medication and my doctor put me back on a regular script. Then, my damned doctor decided he was getting out of the pain management business so 2 weeks after being put back on a steady script I had to find a new doctor. That was a pain in the ass and made me so mad that I was even back on these medications.\n\nSince then, I've fallen quite hard back into old addiction-like habits and just wish I could manage my life without narcotics. I really don't see myself on these things forever and having an addiction is SO EXPENSIVE. \n\nSo, here's my thought - I need to get clean. I just do. \n\nExcept I'm so nervous for what withdrawals will do to me yet again. It's such a hard process to go through and can be a bit expensive if you use a medical detox facility. \n\nI'm thinking of cutting costs by seeing my hematologist\/cancer specialist. I don't have cancer, he sees me for anemia issues, but his office offers IV hydration and any medication you might need from IV pain meds to chemotherapy. Each visit costs me $150 though, but seeing him 5 times from Monday - Friday is a lot cheaper than going to a medical detox facility.\n\nI already have clonidine at home from last time, and all I would need is a script for something like Valium and possibly a muscle relaxant.\n\nI don't know. I'm just typing out thoughts. Can anyone else add in anything that might be useful. I just want to be 100% sure about this because I don't exactly want to fail AGAIN.","249":"I thought it'd be fun to do a bit of Q&amp;A with you guys so here are the questions:\n\n1.

Unfortunately, I got a call today that they lost two major clients and couldn't afford to keep my position open. Evil thing. I'd only been working a week. Now I'm FREAKING out about my finances again. FML. \n\nCan I just check out from real life for the next year-eternity.

I went to see my pain specialist yesterday morning and he said he never denied me access to care in the ER. He said he received an angry call from the ER doctor telling him he shouldn't be prescribing me anything and that I was in there faking my illness. \n\nSo apparently the whole, \"you're under pain management and your new contract for all his patient's states emergency care is off the table\" rant by the ER doctor was an entire lie.\n\nSomeone who had seen me for less than 5 minutes made the determination I was lying and then called my regular doctors to tell them I was in there lying. Apparently, according to my pain specialist, he doesn't recommend I ever go back to that hospital again because the note is so severe he doesn't think I'll ever get adequate treatment again. \n\nI've been treated at this hospital for almost 10 years now. \n\nI'm slowly becoming increasingly suicidal.

I've got my own boyfriend, a new place, and a job. Life is finally moving along smoothly. I'm still on the opiate script for 2mg dilaudids 3x\/day which isn't enough, but beggars can't be choosers right? Overall though I don't think it matters how much medication I do or do not have, I'm still gonna be in pain. I just wont be in pain AND withdrawals now. Anyway, sending everyone love and hope you too are swimming on your own :-).","254":"My pain specialist is getting out of the pain management business. Which means, I now no longer have a pain doctor. This was super fusterating and with just a month to find one I freaked out a bit. I finally was able to snag an appointment for the 2nd of April with someone so hopefully, that goes well.\n\nSimultaneously I started to flare super badly. Vomiting violently multiple times and having bad bowel movements. I couldn't handle it. I went down to the ER and ended up being admitted because my labs were all over the place. Since my pain specialist is no longer my doctor I got assigned to the regular in-house pain team here at the hospital.\n\nI realized I was essentially abusing and go through my script way fast taking closer to 30mgs of oxycodone versus the perscribed 10mgs. Bad. I know, but I was really trying to avoid being in the hospital and I ended up here anyway.\n\nWell, as you can imagine I was very nervous to talk to the in-house pain team about this. i explained to the doctor, \"I was perscribed 10mgs but was really needing 30mgs in a day and now I'm flaring and its hard to keep it under control\" to my surprise he organized my pain meds to match what I was used to versus what I was prescribed and has promised to send me home with a comparable script. He also recommended I do a ketamine infusion. Which, I am now scheduled to do tomorrow. I'm super nervous about it, but hopefully, all goes well.\n\nOn top of that, I should be getting some good recommendations for pain specialists. So, that's a bonus\/plus too.","255":"There was a time in my life where I sincerely believe suicide was the only answer for me. After my brother's passing that was no longer a viable option and never will be. Today, I appreciate being alive and was wondering if anyone felt the same way? Even though it's hard, life is beautiful.","256":"My pain specialist will no longer be my doctor as of June. He's taking on workers compensation patients only from then on out. To say I'm very stressed out by this is an understatement. I have a list of new doctors to call to transfer the prescription to someone new, but then I've noticed myself slipping on my current script yet again. I don't know if my pain is being inadequately managed or if I'm just a fiend or probably both. But, what can I do? \n\nI'm at this point seriously considering going on methadone permanently, but I'm super scared to do that. The last time I was on that my doctor decided it wasn't working, pulled me off it and I became near suicidal and my bones hurt so badly for months afterward.\n\nI'm starting to get really scared about things.","257":"Heya Kid,\n\nWe met online, we've never met in person.

Anway, I had to have an endoscopy where they found an overproduction of bile juice in my stomach corroding my stomach lining. now that we know what's up we're working on getting me ready for discharge. \n\nI want to go home on no opiates but that's unrealistic since I've been here for a week on IV Dilaudid to start followed by oxycodone every 6hrs at 10mgs.\n\nToday we dropped the oxycodone to one-night time dose of 10mgs. I'm hoping to get discharged today. Might still have to do a taper on the opiates outpatient but, I am unsure.","261":"I'm back in the hospital. I've been here nearly a week. Right now I'm getting Oxycodone 5mgs every 6hrs. The pain is outlandish and nausea is intense too. I'm considering seriously hitting up a friend when I get outta here and just buying some pills again. I'm not sure, I don't know, I feel like I'm falling. Juggling pain and addiction is one helluva beast. Right now I'm dealing with severe pain. I already got a breakthrough dose of medication from my doctor earlier today but, I don't think he'd go for a second one. my whole upper abdomen feels like someone is stabbing it with a firey poker that wraps around my shoulder blades. argh grrrr. shitpost had to rant.","262":"I *crashed* hard at 3 p.m., today napped all the way to 6 p.m. Now It's 2:30 a.m., and I've been having intense anxiety for about oh let's say 1.5hrs now. I can't seem to regulate my intense stress levels over trivial matters.\n\n* I'm a little financially strained, meaning I have no room for fun or relaxing\/extra stuff because I'm trying to pay back some old debts by June. \n* I'm having bad opiate cravings for no reason and it's kinda making e angry about things.

WTF am I going to do then!?!!??!!?!?\n* &amp; other bullshit like that is on my mind.\n\nI'm adamant about not relapsing. This is insane shit....tho....staying sober isn't even a little easy o fuccccccckkkkk.","263":"So, I got discharged from the hospital today. For roughly 5 days -\/+ a day or two  I was getting 1mg of IV Dilaudid 3x\/day or every 8hrs. \n\nI had been off the opiates for 40ish days before requiring this hospitalization for my pancreatitis. It was (&amp; still is) a fine balance between not torturing myself and handling the potential for relapse.\n\nI made the decision to not take home any pills because I didn't want temptation laying about for me to overuse. Luckily i have a ton of Lyrica, a bit of Valium &amp; my doctor prescribed me Clonodine to help at night. \n\n\nHow bad do you guys think this will be. I'm a bit anxious about it but I figure it can't be as bad as the 10-day withdrawal I had coming off a 3-year habit which peaked at an average of 60mg of oxycodone in a day ya know?  I've been 40 days off so and only needed it for 5 days with 3mgs of Dilaudid in a day......during those 4 days so hopefully, this is a breeze.","264":"So as you all know I've been off the opiates for 40ish days now. Well, my psychiatrist has also been prescribing me TEN 5mg tablets of Diazepam every 30 days. Just to help with sleepless nights as my body rests it's pain scores in the next 30-40 days. I don't &amp; haven't been taking it daily but today I needed it and was out of it and due for a refill.\n\nSo, my Dr called it in and I picked it up. I got home and took what I thought was a 5mg tablet because I had been having muscle spasms and needed a little sleep. However, I slept for 5hours so when I woke up I grabbed the script and checked it out. \n\nTurns out the pharmacy prescribed me WAYYYY more than they should have. They did THIRTY 10mg diazepam tablets!!! I was shocked. It's like Junkie Jesus is trying to drag me back into hell.\n\nSo, I called my doctor and was like, \"uhhhh yah I have way more pills than I should\" He advised I take 5 out for the month, and give the rest to my parents to give me 5 tablets every 30 days for the next 6 months. Since I now basically have a 6 month supply of it. \n\nThe instruction now is to break them in half to make them 5mg tablets. Knowing me I'll probably make 2.5mg tablets by breaking them into 4ths.\n\nAnyway, my dilemma now is that even though I've been honest about it with my doctor IDK if I really want my parents holding onto them. In the past, they've denied me access to medications (opiates) that I've needed and its always a fight. I don't want to get back into counting pills with them either. So, dunno. What do I do?","265":"Without being location specific I live in an area that's engulfed in flames.

We still have electricity and everything, but there's a fire that is 10 min east of me. \n\nAccording to a friend on the fire department, all it takes is one good gust and 1,000 arches goes up in flames.

The smoke hasnt helped.","266":"Oh, my goodness guys. This hasn't been easy. Look what you made me do. *(bonus points if you catch the cheesy reference)* \n\nI originally joined r\/opiates roughly 5 years ago. Mainly to gain insight into my brother's Heroin addiction and death. As I gained that insight I was ultimately getting sick myself. It took a year to diagnose me with a rare condition that has led to chronic pancreatitis and what I still expect is a lifetime of pain.\n\nFor 4-5 years I've been on and off the opioids and for the last 3 years I've been on them nonstop. \n\nDuring my opiate career I've had two boyfriends both non-users. The first would berate me over my addiction and pain problems but was a complete alcoholic. Double standards much? I think so. \n\nThe 2nd boyfriend came within the last four months. He's been very sweet and we've been talking a lot about my health especially since I was starting to consider a need to get off the opiates even a few months before we met. \n\nHowever, as time with him went on and I got to a point where things were do or die for me, myself, I &amp; my future with this new guy. ^(you know how you know it's the one? That's how I feel about this guy) \n\nSo, when I ran out of my script 5 days early and had no money to supplement it, I made a difficult decision. I jumped off the medication cold turkey.\n\nI was on an average of 70mgs of the stuff before I went something like this:\n\n* Day 1: 50mgs\n* Day 2: 40mgs\n* Day 3: 35mgs\n* Day 4: 25mgs\n* Day 5: 0mgs\n\nI consumed my last dose at 7pm on November 25th, 2017. Ironically, if we turned the clock back 7 years my brother would be alive for another 5 days before he'd die of his Heroin OD. I would be clean &amp; sober the day of his death for the first time in 5 years. It's kinda spooky to me and means something. I don't know I've always believed in dates and time and things like that, that everything is connected for a reason and sometimes ***what you think is bad isn't always the worst thing. Sometimes it's even good***.\n\nWith that said I've been battling a Kidney Infection plus my period on top of the withdrawal so needless to say it's been intense. Since quitting some big things I've done are as follows:\n\n1. Declined Narcotics at my Drs. Office\n2. Flushed a 10mg Oxycodone Tablet Down the Toliet\n3. Declined my usual refill &amp; declined a muscle relaxant as well\n4. informed all my Doctors of the change\n\nI am becoming a new person. Entirely. They say every 7 years your cells regenerate to make you new again and 7 years past my brother's death, I am finally new again.","267":"Heya Bropiates. After meeting with the 2nd opinion pain management appoint last week I flew over 400 miles a week later on short notice to be seen by the addiction specialist.\n\nThe specialist wanted me to start a Buprenorphine patch which I am 100% willing to do and want to do despite the potential for a seizure. \n\nI had a seizure once when I tried a 2mg\/0.5mg suboxone film. They think the 0.5mg naloxone in the Buprenorphine and the high dose of Buprenorphine caused me to have a seizure along with the potential of other drugs in my system.\n\nThey think microgram dosing of the Buprenorphine in a patch would be perfect for me. At first I was nervous about doing this but after meeting with the addiction specialist she recommended a few things:\n\n1. USE THE PATCH IN CONJUNCTION WITH MY CURRENT 30MG NARCOTIC DOSE WITHOUT ANY CHANGES EXCEPT ADDING THE LOW DOES PATCH.\n2. DO IT ALL INPATIENT IN THE EVENT OF A POTENTIAL SEIZURE\n3. EVENTUALLY WEEN OFF THE NARCOTIC AND JUST BE ON THE BUPRENORPHINE PATCH\n4. GET OFF EVERYTHING INCLUDING THE BUPRENORPHINE WHEN THE TIMING IS RIGHT FOR EVERYTHING ABOUT 1.5-2.5 YEARS FROM NOW. \n\nI do eventually want to be off the drugs, but it's hard you know.\n\nI was so surprised she recommended to keep me on the narcotic, 30mgs of oxycodone. She said if I do it that way I'll most likely eliminate problems with breaking through the suboxone on my receptors for the pain problems. \n\nThen when I have pain flares if I could use an at home script I'd be able to stay out of the hospital and have 24\/7 pain relief instead of this yo-yo*ing* effect and nightly withdrawals I've been dealing with. \n\nThe specialist seemed to think staying on the microgram dosing wouldn't block the opiate the way it does in 2mg+ doses. It'd be like a 20mcg dose so it'd be easier\/simplier to breakthrough the pain \n\nShe alaso said later on down the line once I get stability I could switch to just the patch alone and then from there potentially come off of the patch entirely.\n\n***I'm really happy about this.***\n\nUnfortunately, my parents aren't on board and accused me of lying to the doctor about things, when I was brutally honest. I don't think I've ever been this honest with doctors before and this was her professional opinion. \n\nI'm upset with my family they keep calling me a street junkie and belittle me over my use of drugs in the first place and they say a lot of deeming things, but it's rough because I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm  just trying to do the right thing for my pain and it just seems like my parents are unsupportive and it's really upsetting me quite a bit.\n\nSupport would be warmly welcomed! Here's to hoping things go well and I do better now.","268":"So, I may be starting Butrans patches. I have my worries, but I think I'm going to do it regardless and give getting stability back in my life a try. So, with that, I've started to think about potentially doing the last high. \n\nI feel like if I do abuse my pain medication for that final high I'll be setting myself up to fail. Or somehow aren't truly ready to make the swap off the pills.\n\nAlternatively, if I don't abuse it then I'm setting myself up for success.\n\nOR perhaps it'd be better to have that final high and get it out of my system so I'm not thinking about it during the butrans patch period of time. However, I think I'll always romanticize the quick fast-acting narcotic pain relief that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside while conquering pain problems ... seriously, when I drop from an 8 of pain on the pain scale to a 3 it is better than a fucking orgasm.\n\nI dunno. Feel free to chime into the conversation.","269":"Today I had my appointment at the specialist's clinic that was a day's drive away from me. I got a second opinion on my pain issues. \n\nAfter spending 8am - 2pm there I walked away from it knowing that I definitely have serious pain issues and that the opiates are putting me into a vicious cycle of pain, withdrawal, and feeling \"okayish\" \n\nI am on 30-45mgs of oxycodone per day right now. \n\nIt doesn't make sense to up the dosage, it doesn't make sense to be on this for life and it doesn't make sense to keep going through the ups &amp; downs of withdrawal. Especially because I'm currently experiencing withdrawals *nightly* around 3 in the morning. I can't handle to constant yo-yo*ing* of my medical problems and upset with hospital visits etc.\n\nThe next step in all of this is that I'm going to see an addictionologist. \n\nThen I will go on suboxone patches (butrans patch) for pain purposes at a low dose. It'll all be done, inpatient. Mainly because I had a problem with suboxone film strips that you take orally. I had a seizure on that. \n\nIf it's successful and I can tolerate the butrans patch (goes on skin) then I can handle the pain better and pick up my life and once I gain stability on the patch, I can begin to get off these narcotic type medications entirely. \n\nIt scares me though because my pain problems are severe. I just don't know anymore. I'm really on the fence about this decision. \n\nThis isn't some Malibu recovery center that charges you $50,000 upfront since insurance won't cover it either, it's a hospital program that my insurance will cover and that has a real shot at weening me down and directing me correctly. \n\nThe fact that it's a hospitalized medical thing makes me feel a bit more comfortable, but I am completely unsure of everything. I may want to stay with what I know and what is predictable which is creating a lot of turmoil in my life or I can go, get serious, take this route and hope for the best.\n","270":"How is everyone? Like seriously, I wanna know. I've been very MIA and I miss you all.\n\nPersonally,\n\nI'm on the countdown to my 2nd opinion appointment. For the first time in a few years, I'll be getting another opinion on what to do about the situation I am in. \n\nFor those that don't know, I have a rare pancreatic condition. For the past 8.5 months, I've averaged a 5day hospital on a monthly basis for 7 months. \n\nWe're currently almost on month 2 without a hospital visit and that's a big fucking deal. I think part of it is that I've started giving a shit again and am just coping better :-). Don't get me wrong it's hard as fuck &amp; suicide has been on the brain a bit more realistically lately, but, hell if I'm gonna kill myself I might as well at least try first so, I've been doing that. Somehow the logic is twisted but it's working for me.\n\nJeepers. I'm rambling now, but ya. HI. How are you doing?","271":"I'm so embarrassed. \n\nLife is supposed to be good. Everything is supposed to be better. I'm supposed to be doing better, I **am** doing better. \n\nYet, I just want to die. I have a passive death wish. Clean, high, pain, pain-free I don't give a fuck. \n\nI've been in withdrawals for 2 ish days now. \n\nThe works, vomiting, runny tummy, hot\/cold flashes pain that makes sticking a hot poker into my eye sound like a *good* idea and my mother is running around the house going, \"look she's so high she's made herself sick! She's shitting herself and can't stop vomiting, why did you take so many drugs!?\" \n\n&amp; I'm here trying to explain withdrawals to no avail.\n\n\nI just need to be dead.","272":"2 days ago (October 29th) I had my golden Birthday. That's when you turn the age of the day of your birthday. For those that don't know this. For me that meant I was 29 on October 29th. \n\nI could not have been more miserable and angry with myself for being miserable about it.\n\nMy new man had booked us a cabin the woods as a birthday gift to me. We have only been together a month. ANyway, in an effort to NOT be dope sick on my birthday or in the cabin, I went through withdrawals a week and a half ago. \n\nI had it counted perfectly.gave mom enough pills to last me for my trip and told her no to give them to me till X day. I stuck to it and was really proud of myself for sticking to it. \n\nSo we get to the cabin and I'm counting out what I have when my brain decides that October 29th doesn't to exist. So I count out for October 27th, 28th, &amp; 30th. I was supposed to be out in the early morning on the 30th since that was the day we were headed home into town. \n\nSo, I wake p on the 29th (my birthday) go to take my morning dose and realize my horrible, horrible, horrible mistake. \n\n#Happy fucking birthday to me.\n\nTo top things off I also had a cold somehow and came to the \"sad\" realization that I'm almost 30 in a body that could easily be at least twice my age. I felt so bad for my man too, because I was really sour. He took it in strides like a champ though and did a few things to help me feel better, bath, sex, walks, food, comfort meds from CVS, that sorta thing. \n\nWe even debated going to the hospital but I insisted on not doing that because I know how useless they are. Even though I was having a bit of projectile vomiting (so I'm not all convinced it was purely withdrawals) I did eat quite a bit of junk food out there so that my have been contributing.\n\nI made the best of it all though. At least as best as I could and then when we got home on the 30th my hematologist was gracious enough to squeeze me into an appointment so I could get a set of IV pain meds, IV nausea meds, IV stomach meds, and IV fluids. I should be square for the next 12-24hrs now. \n\nAnyway, ya, I wasn't expecting that at all. I hope everyone is having a happier Halloween than I did birthday.","273":"As many of you may know, I have survived some extreme tragedies. Including the loss of my younger brother. Every year for the last 5 years I've made a post here about him on both his birthday and his passing. \n\n\n#Today is his birthday. He'd be 27 today. He died when he was 20 of a heroin overdose. If his story can help just one person think twice about his or her addiction then, his death wasn't in vain.\n\n\nMost importantly, I think his death has saved my life. I rather go through withdrawals than cross the bridge to heroin. A few days ago this was put to the test and I opted for withdrawals. \n\n\nApparently two years ago I set up an auto-email for myself for today. Not because I thought I'd forget today, but because I needed to remind myself that it's all OKAY. I got the year wrong in this auto email. It was supposed to send last year, but it sent this year. I was really surprised to get it today. Here is what it read:\n\n&gt;Dear FutureMe,\n\n&gt;Right now its the middle of June. In 4 months you will be celebrating [BROTHER]'s 26th birthday. Even though he's not around anymore remember the good times and don't forget to take care of yourself because you are loved.\n\n&gt;Xo,\n\n&gt;You.\n\n\nIt's his 27th birthday today, not 26th and I still miss him immensely. Today is a very complicated day for me. I'm not sure how to feel today. Roughly 3 weeks ago I started seeing someone new. Today is my new boyfriend's birthday. I don't know to feel about it exactly. Today is weird. \n\nAnyway, I love you all thanks for being there for me!","274":"I measure my months by my refill dates...\n\n...So far this is the first month in 7 months that I haven't had a 3+ day hospital stay. I'm really proud of myself for that. It's also the first month in 3 months I haven't required an early refill. I successfully tapered from 80mgs to 15mgs per day in ONE month. However, when I get my refill later this week I will jump back to 30mgs per day. I think that's sustainable now. I'm planning on asking my doctor for ninety 10mg oxys and then only take 20mgs per day and build a reserve stash for those days when the pay is outstanding\/horrid. \n\nAlso, in the last two weeks I've started seeing someone new. My life is finally picking up and I'm getting a little healthier. Oh and that pain clinic I've been wanting to get into? Yah, I got in, I go next month for a full day evaluation and am going to get a second opinion on my issues and how to manage my severe pancreatic pain problems.\n\nI seriously am looking forward to it.\n\nThen better than that in the last two weeks I started seeing someone new. We met on OkCupid which, I had joined as a *joke.* So, I was super suprised to like this guy as much as I do.\n\nHe's a cancer survivor so my new guy gets and understands the medical side of things. He's not on any opiates either and although we haven't been intimate, I've started referring to him as my boyfriend and likewise I'm his \"girlfriend.\" \n\nYou know how you meet that SO and you just \"know\" it's the one? Yah, that's how I feel. I've never felt that before. This is so new to me, I'm doing everything in my power not to fuck this up. \n\nI cannot believe what a helluva month it's been.","275":"Love, there isn\u2019t a day I don\u2019t think about you. I am proud to say you are not only my cousin but my friend and that will never change. I am not okay, I miss you a lot today. No one can ever replace you. Deep down I know you\u2019re no longer suffering. So, I\u2019m wishing you well and just hoping that wherever you are, you happy. Everyday you are missed more and more. You are not forgotten.\n\nRest in Peace Gorgeous. \n\nForever &amp; Always,\n\nDori.\n\nPS: I am proud to say you are not only my cousin but **my friend and that will never change.** ","276":"I'm having a lot of anxiety atm. Anyone wanna chitchat? Xo.","277":"Heya Fam!\n\nAs you may know I've run into some turbulent times. My parents are wanting me to go to rehab, and my doctor is urging me to get my use under control because he will no longer write anymore early refills for me. I've required one for the past two months and he's basically told me to suck it up and stick to what he scripts me. Which, I have no problem with. As a result I have been on a taper and am finally comfy at 37.5mgs of oxycodone. I will however need to bring that down to 30mgs in the next 5 days. I think it's very realistic and doable.\n\nWhile all of this has been going on we've been looking into everything from rehabs, dual diagnosis centers to pain clinics. The rehabs and dual diagnosis places denied me based on the severity of my medical condition. Those places felt they would not be able to help me. It was both devastating and relieving to hear that. \n\nAnyway, there was this one program that took me two months to hear back from, and lots of paperwork had to be sent it. I got a call the other day that they're gonna take on my case! I'm SO EXCITED. It's not a detox or a rehab at all. It's a pain clinic that's 8hrs away from me. \n\nMy appointment is in 2moths from now. They're doing a full day evaluation session. I arrive at 8am to coordinate paperwork and get information together with the receptionist. Then at 8:30 I meet with the Pain Specialist\/Doctor for 75 minutes. They do a full intake and evaluation of my situation. That is followed up b 75 minutes of physical therapy consult and session and finallly ends with a 90 minute session with the pain psychologist. \n\nAfter that I go to lunch for an hour and come back to meet with the entire team for 30-45minutes to discuss what they think and any recommendations they may have for me regarding my situation. \n\nMy trip is going to be open ended because they could have me stay for their inpatient program where they adjust medications, monitor your mental health, and stabilize you if you need it. It's all personalized for me specially and I'm so excited that they think they can help me after reviewing my medical records.\n\nI plan to be as honest as possible too. For instance, I will admit to overtaking my script and that I have a tendency to abuse my medications to avoid going to the emergency room when I probably should just go to the emergency room. I probably wont mention snorting my medication but like I said I'll talk about how I've been doubling it up and just struggling. I also plan to be honest about my diet and what I've found works for my GI System and what does not work for it. \n\nSo yah. They already told me they wont write me any narcotic scripts the first visit, which I'm 100% okay with since I can't accept it anyway because of my local pain specialist. \n\nAnywhoozles, I'm excited about it and had to share!","278":"Guys, if my habit is 50-60mgs of oxy per day and I'm withdrawing at a rate decreas of 5mgs every 3 days how much lope should I be taking to ease things? I'm noticing I'm feeling achy all day long and am spending about 6 hours in a 24hr period in mild withdrawals, achy bones, achy muscles, hot\/cold, sweating etc. It's coming at the 4-6 hr mark of each dose I take and stuff plus, I'm in regular pain too so I'm feeling icky. I'm thinking lope can help but IDK what or how much to take of it. Please advise.","279":"Firstly, I've been in the hospital for 5 days. I don't know when this item went missing but I sure as fuck haven't been home. I'm being accused of stealing something. I don't even know what I'm accused of stealing, mom is on a war path looking for \"something,\" It's a big enough deal that she canceled her evening activities because of it. She never cancels! I'm freaking the fuck out now because I'm getting yelled at for something I didn't do simply because I \"do drugs.\" I'll be the first person to admit I have a drug problem but never have I ever stolen from my parents or anyone else. I'm flipping the fuck out right now and its causing me so much anxiety. My relationship with my parents is quickly deteriorating. I don't know what to do. I feel like a loser even though I 1,000% didn't take whatever the fuck it is that's so important she's turning the house upside down looking for. Including my room. My entire room has been ransacked. FML. The worst thing I did tonight was order takeout. I fucking didn't steal anything!!! \n\nRant over.\n\nEDIT: I texted my dad that this time I would let him kill my dog if I was found lying because I'm not fucking lying. At all. She'll find it, I'm sure of it, but until then I get to be the bad guy. Ugh.","280":"So just a little backstory for the uninformed on my story. My parents caught me snorting my Opana medication, and also discovered I was 15 days early out of a refill. We decided to go cold turkey on it and only take 2.5mg doses of the Opana to get me to the next week so I could see my doctor. \n\nWell, I never got through the labor day weekend. I ended up in the hospital on Sunday and have been there ever since. I'm here now. Should be going home tomorrow and my doctor graciously has decided to renew my script. \n\nHe is however taking me off the Opana, he doesn't know I was snorting it, my parents didn't snitch, but I made it clear he can't prescribe that to me anymore that it was causing problems with withdrawal.\n\nAlso, in an effort to decrease the overall dosage when you do the equivalents of standard oral Opana to Oxycodone (2:1) I'm taking a 10mg decrease per day hit. So I'll be getting 30mgs of Oxycodone per 24hr period. \n\nWe spent this whole hospital stay getting my medications resorted and putting me on bowel rest &amp; letting antibiotics do their magic. As it turns out I had an active mild type of sepsis and my liver functions\/pancreatic enzymes were high. \n\nWhich, although isn't good, made me feel better about my usage because it shows something was really wrong and instead of just swallowing my pills I should've gone to the hospital to begin with.\n\nGoing forward, I plan to make it a damned mission to not get an early refill. My doctor has made it clear he's going to let me drown if I do this again. Although, it's a bit more understood because of the sepsis &amp; elevated functions. Hence, the break my doctor is giving me, but the lesson there is if I'm in more pain no matter how much I hate the hospital - I need to go to the hospital. \n\nAlso, while my parents did not tattle on me to my regular doctors they did tell my shrink so, I get to go into his office sometime next week with my tail between my legs and apologize for the bad behavior because, he's definitely irritated with me. \n\nI kinda feel like a failed case\/patient. I've been in therapy since I was 16 with him and arguably I've gotten worse in the last 12 years. He's great though, he cares and I sometimes think of him as a grandfather type figure. I really need to keep up my regular appointments with him.\n\nOther than that, I'm recovering. We're also getting a second opinion from an specific inpatient pain program that's about 8 hrs away. Just got the call that their doctors are reviewing my case and will be in touch. They have an inpatient hospital program where they evaluate the medications that would work best for you. They have you talk to shrinks and do group work etc. to find ways to manage your pain in between medication doses along with making sure you're on the right dosages. It is NOT a detox. So, I'm hoping to get into that program. It would be a lifesaver if I do.\n\nEnd of story. Thanks for the harsh words, compassion, love, and for keeping it real.","281":"UPDATE HERE: https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/6xfofl\/rehab_said_no_no_no\/\n\nSo, dad caught me snorting my meds, well rather he found the straw I used which led to a confession of snorting my medication. I've been so good with sticking to my script, I actually haven't snorted in a long time, but that's apparently irrelevant. \n\nWe called my physicatirst who recommended an inpatient rehab facility. We called around a bunch of places and we found one that says they're not going to rip me off all my medications. Rather they're going to work with me to find the dosage and medication that fits best.\n\nFrom there they'll probably encourage me to get sober, but we'll see. I have a lot of very real medical problems and leaving me without pain control just seems cruel. So if I'm MIA I'm in a rehab\/hospital facility figuring my life out.\n\nI say goodbye to my dog and everything I know to make a change in my life that I'm not sure will actually help. If I wasn't such a pansy, I'd just kill myself and be done with it, but I can't bring myself to do that, so there is that. I'm really scared. \n\nGuys help calm me down.\n\nEDIT: I'm also really scared. I can't handle being given a bait and switch and forced off of medication.

My itch still wasn't scratched though so I called up my connect for blues and got some extras for $450 total. \n\nThen, I have a friend who I played Junkie Jesus for. She's been in a bad spot so I kicked her 3 of my blues, $20 for gas and \"loaned\" her $80 because she was stuck owing her guy $80. She's like my only friend I know that uses. So, I didn't mind helping her out and chances are I would've gambled that $80 again and lost it so instead of giving it to the casino - she gets it.\n\nAfter that I went to clinic today an they gave me IV dilaudid and now I'm home just chilling and feeling pretty good without injecting anything I'm not supposed to.

I am now due for a follow up CT to see if that 5mm mass has grown any. If it has grown, I likely have lung cancer. I go for the CT on the 21st and see my doctor on the 24th. \n\nI was getting really anxious about this possibility and decided to use Dr. Google to see if my fears were justified. Here is what I found it was about Cushing's Syndrome:\n\n&gt;weight gain, easy bruising, weakness, drowsiness, and fluid retention. Cushing syndrome can also cause high blood pressure and high blood sugar levels (or even diabetes).\n\nAccording to the [American Cancer Society](https:\/\/www.cancer.org\/cancer\/lung-cancer\/prevention-and-early-detection\/signs-and-symptoms.html) Cushings is a parananeoplastic syndrome associate with lung cancer. These problems are called paraneoplastic syndromes. Sometimes these syndromes can be the first symptoms of lung cancer. \n\nThat's just great because:\n\n1. Weight Gain: Gained 50lbs in the last year\n2. Easy Bruising: I bruise everytime an IV is inserted even when done correctly. I also have a few random bruises that I don't know where they came from.\n3. Weakness: Just in general I would say I'm pretty weak\n4. Drowsiness: For the past two weeks I've been sleeping for 3+ hours at a time on a daily basis after getting a full night's sleep.\n5. High blood pressure: Every doctors visit and time I check it its been abnormally high for a few months.\n6. High Blood Sugar: Apparently for the last 3 visits over the last 5 months to my doctors office my blood sugar has been really high.\n\nThose are just symptoms of cushing's syndrome but I have almost all of them. As for general symptoms of lung cancer, I've been coughing and sneezing blood for a week and a half plus I've been breathing really heavily to the point where friends\/family are commenting on it. \n\nI also am at huge risk because I've been sick with chronic pancreatitis for a very long time and have probably received more radiation than I should have over the last few years. My grandmother passed away from lung cancer too, granted she was an EX smoker and had been smoke free for 20 years when she got the cancer. So, I think that puts me at risk too. Luckily, I am not a smoker so I've got that going for me at least.\n\n-----------\n\nI think I'm right to be a little more spooked than the average bear. As a result, I've stopped Googling Lung  Cancer, but feel the need to process my thoughts. Hence why I'm telling Reddit and you are reading this now. I was thinking about it and I just told a friend this:\n\n&gt;Like it sucks, but life has been really hard thus far, it'd be almost nice to relax and know death is coming. I wouldn't choose it, I would never say \"I want to die\" and I'll be pissed if I am but at the same time there's this sense like \"well I guess this is for the best - saving me from more agony that life generally causes\"\n\nI hope that makes sense. Thanks for listening.\n\n----------------\n\nTL;DR: I have justifiable reasons to believe I probably have Lung Cancer, if I do, my life has been really hard. I think I might prefer the idea of dying sooner vs. sometime unknown in the distant future. I need to process these thoughts. \n\n***EDIT: Thank you so much for all of the kind words, you guys seriously fucking rock. I'm gonna try to personally respond to everyone. Thanks so much!

I posted it for *fun* but it does bring to light a very serious conversation to be had.\n\nI was surprised by the number of people who were saying calling addiction a disease is a bad thing, a crutch if you. But what if I told you calling it a disease and using it as a crutch can be a positive\/good thing? What if I told you it could lead to recovery? \n\nI personally believe that addiction is a disease and that by denying that a person is only perpetuating myths and stigmas regarding addiction and dependence.\n\nI have a few diagnosis\/diseases:\n\n* Gastroparesis\n* Chronic Pancreatitis\n* Addiction\/Opioid Dependence\n* Schizoaffective Disorder\n\nI would be very comfortable telling people that I was battling those four diseases, but everyone looks at it differently.\n\nI understand that it isn't a traditional disease,^[1](http:\/\/www.tandfonline.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1080\/02791072.1993.10472271) but would you say mental illness isn't a sickness of sorts too? What would you call it? A choice? If it was a choice addicts wouldn't exist because they would be able to quit anytime.^[2](http:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/278\/5335\/45) Addiction is a disease of disease of compulsion and drive. It involves the Orbitofrontal Cortex.^[3](http:\/\/cercor.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/10\/3\/318.short)\n\nI believe that playing the sick role^[4](http:\/\/davidscottsociology.tripod.com\/sitebuildercontent\/sitebuilderfiles\/illnessbehaviorandthesickrole.pdf) gets you nowhere and I think that is where people get upset with labeling addiction as a disease because people use it as a crutch. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.^[5](https:\/\/www.psychologytoday.com\/blog\/ambigamy\/201404\/psychological-crutches-ten-myths-and-three-tips) \n\nHOWEVER Using in the following forms isn't a great idea (in my opinion):\n\n* *I can't help it! I'm sick, I'm gonna do more dope because of it!*\n\n* *I only do this dope because I have an illness!!!*\n\n* *I'm dopesick and need my drugs to get better! This illness is killing me*\n\nThese are examples of using it as a crutch in a negative manner. However, labeling it as a disease and using it to enable yourself to become better is a different story. Once you know you are dealing with a drug addiction disease it can lead to better ways to treat the sickness and can enable people to get better.^[5](http:\/\/www.asam.org\/public-resources\/treatment)\n\nJust my thoughts on it.

Oh well, hopefully, it works in my favor now that I'm headed home. \n\nI visited the ER 2 times during my 20-day stay once because my neck surgery was SO painful in the cold there, more so than normal, and my neurosurgeon sent me based on my symptoms. They prescribed Klonopin to help me sleep\/deal with the anxiety I was facing and apparently it works as a muscle relaxer too.\n\nThen, the 2nd time I was vomiting for 3 days before I went in again.

At least I'm not vomiting anymore. Pain has just been bad, between the spine surgery and pancreatic issues I've been in so much pain.\n\nTraveling today has been an absolute disaster.

It was the end of fall term. \n\n&gt;I spent a few hours on campus, dropped off the final and skipped out on class. I remember being confronted by the teacher\u2019s assistant, \u201cWhy are you leaving early?\u201d  he barked at my friend and I as we attempted to leave the 300-student lecture hall. I responded with, \u201cI\u2019ve got a class to drop and family business to take care of. I\u2019ve attended every lecture and I need to go.\u201d He couldn\u2019t keep me there and I left. He seemed puzzled by my commitment to family, that family was more important to me than school. I remember him protesting to me, **lecturing me that family, places to be, and things to do would always be there. That I should seize hold of my education and opportunity ahead of me.**\n\n&gt;At that moment I agreed with him, and to be honest, I was just being a terrible student in that moment. It was the end of the term, I was having a good day and I didn\u2019t feel like sitting through the professor\u2019s last lecture.\n\n&gt;As I got into my apartment hallway on my way home I noticed my phone had a voicemail. I remember listening to it in the elevator, on my way to the first floor. Short and sweet it struck fear into my heart:\n \n&gt;\u201cHey Dori, it is Daddy. Call me\u2014we need to talk.\u201d\n\n&gt; I called him back right away from the hallway on the house line. The phone rang once, and he answered. We talked, and he said that him and mom were coming right over, that there was something to discuss\u2014we needed to have a family meeting right away, and they would be at my apartment. \n\n&gt;Right away it was strange; we had just had a huge meeting about finances that weekend. Why would we need to meet again? Now? What for? I flew into a mode of panic. The apartment was a mess. I had twenty girls over the night before and didn\u2019t get a chance to really clean up that morning. Quickly I started cleaning the apartment like I never had before. I\u2019m not one to keep things disorganized but I\u2019m not one to clean either, especially for my parents. The behavior was anxiety induced and at first it worked as a great distraction: \u201cJust get the apartment cleaned\u2014think about things later.\u201d  I don\u2019t know why I felt this way. Perhaps it was something in my father's tone that gave him away or a sixth sense of sorts that I had. that afternoon. I acted out of pure fear and It took 20 minutes to get the kitchen, bedroom area, and living area fully organized and done. Even had time to get the laundry sorted and clean clothes on hangers. My parents should have been arriving at any minute.\n\n&gt;Yet they weren\u2019t there. Another five long minutes passed and I racked my brain, \u201cThis isn\u2019t good,\u201d I thought to myself, as I peeked out the front window to look for them pulling up. They weren\u2019t there, and I paced.\n\u201cWell, think!\u201d I remember telling myself harshly. I remember analyzing it. \u201cDad called me, not mom. He said Daddy. Something\u2019s wrong, his tone was off. My great grandmother, she\u2019s 93 perhaps something horrible has happened to her? But that\u2019s on Mom\u2019s side, why wouldn\u2019t mom call me about that?\u201d I wondered, \u201cWell, wait, the dog\u2019s been sick. We know we have to put him down soon. Maybe he needs to be put down. Maybe the vet called.\u201d\n        \t\n&gt;\u201cMy brother is going to freak out. I wonder if he\u2019s coming with mom and dad. They should be in the car by now. It\u2019s been thirty minutes, they should\u2019ve been here by now. They don\u2019t live that far away. Maybe I should call the house and see if my brother answers, they\u2019re probably in the car alone without him and he\u2019s at home and already knows.\u201d\n\n&gt;It was at that moment I was paralyzed with fear. I went to dial the house number but could not. I did not want to confirm the next thought I had. \u201cWhat if my brother doesn\u2019t answer? What if something\u2019s happened to him?\u201d\nAnd then it struck me, ten minutes before my parents arrived. Ten minutes before I knew anything had happened, I feared the worst. \u201cWhat if my brother got into trouble\u2014what if he\u2019s dead?\u201d And like a mantra I repeated over and over again, out loud, \u201cPlease let it be the dog. Please let it be the dog. Don\u2019t let it be him, not him.\u201d\n\n&gt;Ten minutes of this sorta prayer went on, and I saw my parents pull up through the upstairs window. Before I knew it they were at my door, and as I opened the door before they could even fully ring the bell because I was right on the other end, waiting, I saw my mother\u2019s face, a picture of distress and anguish, an expression that is the definition of pure anguish, and without words I reached out to hug her, knowing something was horribly amiss. But before I could dive in for that hug, dad touched my shoulder and simply said, \u201cYour brother is dead.\u201d I crumpled to the ground in what was a collapse in tears of incomprehensible grief.\n\nJust in case anyone is wondering, he died of a heroin overdose.

I'm both ecstatic (because, fuck ya no pain finally, what I need) and disappointed (because, oh hell no, do I need to live like this for LIFE!?!?!!??!!?) and it feels really weird.\n\nDunno shit post wanted to share.","320":"As many of you know I have an abundant amount of spine and stomach issues. Today, I'm talking about my spine. I went to see my Neurosurgeon and he said that my neck surgery was 2 levels. 1 level healed fine but the 2nd healed improperly and then that has caused some issue at the level below my surgery site.\n\nThe doctor said that this is primarily treated with pain medication and cervical epidurals. Surgery is an option but it's an absolute life or death last resort kinda thing. They do not want to do it if they can avoid it.\n\nFor me, this is both bittersweet. On one hand, my doctor is going to call my pain specialist and explain\/request that I be on a higher dosage of pain medication. On the other hand, it's devastating to be in so much pain. I haven't even been getting high from my medication just barely out of pain.  I do feel relieved that all my pain medication needs and extra buys haven't been because I'm just fine, because I'm obviously not. \n\nFor me, getting high is probably equivalent of any other persons normal. I can do things, I feel better, I have energy and I can function. \n\nAs for the epidural option, I'll know more when I talk to my pain specialist but from what I understand neck epidurals can be dangerous and stuff. :(\n\nNot to mention, I'm supposed to be traveling outside of the country and I'm super nervous about it seeing as I'm going to be away from all my doctors for a month and that might be hard. I'm going to request that my pain doctor give me extra medications for breakthrough pain on top of the increase for the just in case if things get bad I don't have to cut my trip short or something.\n\nPlus, I'm not looking forward to the flight to Europe. I am still wanting\/needing to go though. Blah. Sorry for the wall of text.","321":"Hey! I know the holidays can be a weird time for some of us. If anyone is finding themselves extremely lonely this Halloween, I thought I'd chill out here and offer to talk to you. You can send me a PM or just respond directly here. \n\nI'm here for you! Have a Spooktacular Halloween &lt;3.","322":"Except, I forgot to post this past October 24th, 2016 when my brother would have been 26 this year. He died six years ago of a heroin overdose. Alone in his room. For the past 2 years, I've posted about his death on his birthday. ([Here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/3q2f7k\/an_anecdote_from_the_day_my_brother_died\/) &amp; [Here](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/2k5ri0\/in_about_an_hour_and_a_half_we_always_counted_our\/)) \n\nI feel ***awful*** not only because I forgot to post on his Birthday, but I forgot it was even his Birthday. I woke up that morning with shooting pains down my left arm, tingling and a lot of numbness in my fingers. It was a lot like my issues before my spinal neck surgery. \n\nSo, for the entire day, I was in incredible pain and ended up going to the ER late that night. My mom came by the ER around 11pm to sit with me, something she rarely does, and it was then that she realized I forgot the birthday. \n\nWhile I feel awful about forgetting his birthday, I can't help but feel relieved too, like maybe I'm somehow moving on and not stuck in the past missing him. \n\nFor the past 6 years there hadn't been a day I didn't think about my brother until recently when I started to think about him every few days instead of every day.\n\nAnyway, I still wanted to post about him and share, because I think it serves a purpose. Losing him has been the hardest thing I've ever had to deal with. Cherish every moment you have with your loved ones, even if they drive you nuts, there is a reason you love them. Remember and think about that!","323":"Today, I met up with a connect and left my cell phone in his car! I just about flipped a lid because I use Uber and Lyft to get around and was 100% out of cash with the exception of $8 and over 15miles away from my home. It would be really hard to explain to my family how the fuck I ended up out there without my phone or money... \n\nSo...\n\nI tried calling my phone from a strangers phone but that didn't work. I usually have my phone on silent so I expect that's what's happening to me now.\n\nBy the grace of Junkie Jesus I had my laptop on me... So, I whip it out and there happens to be free wifi at my location. THANK JUNKIE JESUS. I text my connect from a web application I use for anything drug related and he comes back to give it back to me! I was so fucking relieved. \n\nIt's my worst nightmare being stuck out in the middle of an unfamiliar area without my cell phone and no money whatsoever. I ended up giving my guy the rest of the cash on me which was just that $8 but, I felt it was only right to \"tip\" him for bringing it back. \n\nI need to get over my nerves when doing deals, I just get shaky, jumpy, nervous, and forgetful which leads to bad shit happening. Hopefully, this is a lesson learned and I can calm the fuck down in the future and NEVER leave my cell behind again.","324":"Hot damn man! I am so excited about getting P-A-I-D tomorrow! It's my 2nd check from this new job and it comes in tomorrow. Right now my boss is being chill and paying me weekly, because I've been super short on cash and he knows it. I'm happy because I'll be able to get rid of my death note (Samsung Galaxy Note 7) and pay I few people I owe cash to (regular loans not drug fronts). Plus, I might even have enough for a few extra meds, we'll see though. \n\nIf not I plan to stash $75-$100 of my money to be able to get a big haul next week or in 2 weeks from now depending on what my doctor scripts me Monday. Which is another thing I'm nervous about for a few reasons. \n\nMy pain doctor used to script me 5mg IR Opana's so I'm going to see if he doesn't mind adding those back into my regime. I had a 10-day hospital stay this month that could've been avoided had I had decent breakthrough pain medication. Although who knows, I did have GI Bleeding too, but after the GI scope my specialist said it was nothing to worry about at all and will heal up on its own! So that is good!\n\nI'm in such a predicament because pain medication actually makes my condition worse in the long run, but leaving my condition alone, I'm non-functional. It just means I can't miss a single dose of medication being an hour late on meds can throw my whole system for a loop. I feel like I'm constantly chasing the pain and wish there was a better option, but such is life.\n\nShitpost because I can!","325":"Ahhhh good things all around. First of all, I got my first paycheck for my new job this past Friday which was super exciting. \n\nUnfortunately, going into work has been difficult this first week. I'm very fatigued but worst of all I'm short on my oxycodone. I'm prescribed and usually take 20mgs in a day but, have had to cut down to 15mgs to get to my next pain doctor appointment because  I had a lot of breakthrough pain this month and required extras. \n\nAnyway, at 15mgs (5mg 3x\/daily) I've been going into withdrawals on a nightly basis. Around 2 or 3am I've woken up consistently in a cold sweat, with my nose running and all the bells and whistles of withdrawal and pain. \n\nFor the past week I've been taking my last 5mgs at 6pm going to bed at 10pm waking at 2am in withdrawals, getting back to bed at 5am and then waking at 9am to take my medication to be out of withdrawals.\n\nI don't think it's mental because I'm waking in a cold sweat vs. being awake and talking myself into it. Anyway, this is a good story so, today I was at my cousin's place and we were talking when suddenly she asks me about my pain and what I go through. I explained my nightly predicament at the moment too.\n\nWell, she broke her arm last month and she was prescribed \"too many\" painkillers. So, she asked if I needed any extras. I got ten 5\/325 Percocet from her and now I can say goodbye to restless sleep. I'm so fucking happy right now. \n\nThank Goodnes Grief God! :-) Nothing like not withdrawing.","326":"HI!\n\nGot into work today for the first time in forever. It's kinda awesome. It's exactly what I want to be doing with website development and advertising. Today I had to do a lot of technical shit including retrieving every god-damned password they needed which was a chore. \n\nMy next job is to clean up the password\/email list so everything is easily accessible and then I can work on the advert structures and whatnot. \n\nAnyway, might sound boring to you, but it's exciting to me and I'm the one doing it so yay!\n\nThey're paying me well for now and then as it grows they're willing to increase my paycheck. I'm a contractor employee which is exactly where I need to be and from what I can tell with growth there's a potential to be making six figures doing this.\n\nPlus, I love the office location. My bank is right there and so is a grocery store and a ton of restaurants. Hahahahaa.\n\nAnyway, shitpost, just wanted to share.\n\n&amp; puppy can come to work with me which I honestly think is the best bit.","327":"I got his toy bear to squeak and he went ballistic!

LoL ...\n\nBe back in a bit gotta go get dog toy off the floor!\n\nShitpost hope you guys enjoy it though!","328":"So, I get super itchy from IV narcotics and the pain team here at the hospital INSISTED that having me on a Narcan drip at ~~12mgs~~ 0.50mgs per hour (12mgs in 24hrs) would not affect my pain meds and would keep the itching at bay.\n\nI've been in a significant amount of pain throughout this hospital stay for the last 8 days. Plus, I've been itchy regardless of the narcan drip.\n\nFinally, today, after they did the colonoscopy and found I have ulcers throughout my colon (yay \/s) did I wake up in pain and the surgery unit gave me IV push pain meds that didn't do jack shit. \n\nI made the decision then and there to refuse the Narcan drip. I got after the pain team for having me on that and no wonder I was in so much pain, etc. they now have me off the Narcan drip and on the Benadryl.\n\nIt's so fucked up because when I first came in they insinuated I like the way Benadryl feels and that Benadryl is addicting in and of itself and I told them about the itching and that is how this whole mess started. \n\nHow fucked are things if doctors are now hesitant to give BENADRYL with an IV Piggyback of 0.5mgs of Dilaudid!?!!?!? What sense does that make! NONE! \n\nLuckily today the pain has been better and everything is okay, I should go home tomorrow but holy fuck did these guys screw me for this stay. I should've refused from day 1 but I was trying my best to be cooperative and practice trusting the professionals. \n\n**It's so sad because TIL I can't trust them. ;-(.**","329":"I was supposed to go over to my potential new place of employment tomorrow but, I fell ill with some GI Bleeding. I'm currently hospitalized and preparing for a colonoscopy. Hopefully, it's an easy thing to fix and doesn't interfere with my new job.\n\nLucky for me the boss knows me outside of a working environment and was understanding. I'm really hoping this new job helps keep me busy and less health things go wrong.\n\nI've slowly been getting better, though. I had the spinal neck surgery in May, the feeding tube was removed in June, and now I'm just starting to get over it all. \n\nSo cheers to a new future!","330":"Not just any job either. A job with a ton of perks. First, the pay is AMAZING. $60k base pay PLUS any comission I may bring in. It's not a sales job either its doing SEO\/Internet Marketing for a small business.

Holy hell fire balls. eeeee. \n\nEDIT: Now all that needs to happen is getting out of the hospital. I've got some GI Bleeding going on so hopefully it clears up. This company is also aware of my health issues and is willing to work with me when I get sick.

The last time we talked I was 13 and she was 16. We had thanksgiving dinner together. Then, 2 years ago we reconnected after being estranged for over a decade. \n\nMy parents limited my communication with her through my teenage and young adulthood years because they wanted to protect me from her Heroin addiction. \n\nWhen we reconnected as women in our mid-late 20s it was like I found my sibling again. My brother had died 4 years prior and her brother who I never knew had died 2 years prior to us reconnecting. Mine had died from a heroin addiction and her brother died of a diabetes complication.\n\nI knew she was headed down the path of relapse and I HATE myself for not speaking up about it. But, then again on September 24th, 2015 when she died we had only been talking again for 8 months. It wasn\u2019t my place to intervene and apparently others close to her had confronted her about it days before she died.\n\nI feel for her mother who now has lost both her adult children. No parent should ever feel that pain.\n\nI miss my cousin so much. Do me a favor guys, and practice harm reduction. In her memory.","332":"My heart races, my bones ache, I try to move around, shift my position, nope. It still hurts. I can feel everything. I wonder carefully, when will it end? When will it stop? When will I feel okay again? When I take my next dose? No, that would be too easy. I may not be in withdrawals, but I am in severe pain. I wish to hell it was better, but it's not. I'm terribly lost.","333":"So, since being caught red-handed with extra medication that wasn't a part of my script things at home have been decent enough. Despite being 27 my parents have asked me to stay home for the next few days and get some of my things in order.\n\nYesterday, that consisted of speaking for quite some time with my dad about what was happening to me with the pain and the subsequent addiction. We also spoke about my father's past and he opened up with things that I cannot share on a public forum, but I came to the realization that my dad knows a lot more about addiction problems than I thought.\n\nHe also knows I'm going to be a challenge to treat due to the fact that he knows not only am I brilliant (his words) but, I'm a clone copy of him in many ways (we have similar thinking patterns, behaviors, and nuances that match up) and that I am addicted to my medication as well as dependent on them for legitimate pain that he's witnessed over the last few years.\n\nSo, according to him rehab is:\n\n1. Probably Not Going to be Effective\n2. Not Worth its Price Tag\n\nSo, yesterday was my last day of being miserable.\n\nToday, I told my dad I was going to get my space organized, help mom do some laundry and kitchen things and just chill out. Well, he gets home and sees everything was followed up on and I didn't blow him off on the things he wanted me to do.\n\nSo, now I have a bouquet of multi-colored roses sitting on the table by the window. He told me they were for getting shit done and that he knows what I've been through and recognizes it isn't easy. He got them both as a reward and \"get better\" gesture. \n\nHonestly, it feels awkward to me, didn't he just catch me with drugs? What is this sorcery? Huh? But, something about it feels right, like he knows, more than I could ever know. \n\n&amp; that alone means the world.\n\n**TL;DR: Got caught with extra meds, rewarded with flowers 3 days later after a few deep discussions and following up on things that needed to be done around the house.**\n\nEDIT\n---\n\nJeepers! Thank you, for all the kind words and support from everyone. I was not expecting this to happen and I was not expecting such a huge response from the community. It doesn't surprise me too much that this is the way my dad is responding.

He doesn't know the URL or the name of this forum just that I knew someone who was preventing deaths.

Obviously, he freaked out, and he said he waited a day to confront me about it. He would like me to go through insurance covered rehab but, knows if I don't want it, it will never work. I agree with him. It won't work now, not while I have so much pain going on that is ill-managed. \n\nI'm not terrified of withdrawals, I'm terrified of PAIN. Not to mention, I don't have any desire to be clean, I just want to be *managed*.\n\nHe made an offer to basically enable me. Move me out of their house, to an apartment, where I'll be able to do what I \"want.\" I put want in quotations because I don't know what I want. All I want is to be out of pain. That's it.\n\nWhat the hell do I do? I feel icky.\n\nMy dad said I didn't have to make any decisions today, that I could wait and see in January, and just see. Amazingly enough, he gave me one of my \"meds\" to pull me out of withdrawals and if I need more, I just need to talk to him for every dose. \n\nI'm sick in so many ways and I'm so just blah.\n\nEdit: I've tried methadone. Worst withdrawals of my fucking life and I had a seizure on Suboxone so those two medications aren't really a viable option. I'm on 50mgs of Oxycodone in 24hrs to stay 100% pain-free &amp; not high. I am prescribed 20mgs\/day by a pain clinic. My doctor refuses to make any increases citing my age &amp; the potential for addiction, which I already have along with dependency.\n\nEdit Again: I also had a feeding tube for 3 years for my pancreatic condition and had spinal surgery this past May.\n","335":"Day two of Withdrawals to reset my tolerance and my god.

On May 6th I went to the ER and they did an emergency MRI. Turns out I had a disc herniation in my neck. \n\nOn the 12th of May, the Neurosurgeon advised surgery to fix the issue within the next three months. On May 16th the pain became so incredible I went back to the emergency room where they admitted me. I had surgery on May 19th and was hospitalized for a total of 10 days 2 of which were spent in the ICU.\n\nMy boyfriend at the time showed up to the hospital maybe twice during that time. That among other things led to a breakup with him, and that was difficult because we lived together.\n\nNow I'm 27, completely disabled with a metal plate in my neck and just feeling cruddy overall, plus I've had to move home. I haven't lived at home since I was 19. It's driving me bonkers. I can barely shower on my own.\n\nNot to mention my doctor is furious with me. I'm on 20mg of oxycodone in a day (which is like nothing) and he wants me down to 15mg. However, I went through my script way fast. Luckily he renewed it early, but if I do that again, I'll be SOL. \n\nI was talking to my therapist who is also an addictions counselor and she said the rate of heroin overdoses has QUADRUPLED because of the restrictions the DEA is putting on doctors. \n\nSo people who would never normally need or want heroin are getting it and overdosing. She said even cancer patients are getting denied pain medication. It is a cruel and unusual world for sure.\n\nThe good news is the feeding tube got removed. THANK GOD. I feel better without it now. It did it's job and now I'm doing better in that department.\n\nFor the curious here is a few pictures that document my feeding tube removal and what they did to my neck:\n\nhttp:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/8AlDx","342":"\/r\/Opiates Guide to Pooping\n-----\n\nI don't know why I felt the need to put so much time into this, but I did so enjoy it!\n\nWhether you\u2019re in withdrawals needing to take Lope or have a heavy habit and can\u2019t go I figured this run down on things would help.\n\nI have a terrible fucking gut due to my gastroparesis &amp; other gastrointestinal issues like pancreatitis. So, take my regime with a huge grain of salt. Unless you\u2019re on insane amounts of narcotics you could probably get away with using 1-2 things from my personal list:\n\n1. Cap of Miralax in my morning coffee\n2. 25mg dose of Movantik with my morning meds\n3. Tablets of Senna in the morning\n4. 1-2 Servings of refried beans throughout the day\n5. Glycerin Suppositories for moderate constipation\n6. Enemas for emergency situations \n\nNatural Helpers:\n-----\n\n**Prunes\/Prune Juice:*** Eating 3-5 Prunes are a day is an easy way to keep your gut moving. One cup of prune juice will work within 2-5hours. Be careful if you eat or drink too much of this, you will end up with problems.\n\n**Coffee:** Coffee is known to stimulate the bowels however, it is not recommended to have more than 2 or 3 cups because it is a diuretic and can cause dehydration.\n\n**Fiber:** Fiber comes in a ton of shapes and forms and will get your gut going.\n\n* Fruits are really great with raspberries providing 8 grams of fiber in a single serving\n* Whole Wheats are also good, think bran, oatmeal, whole wheat bread, and so forth\n* Nuts and Beans are really good especially black beans, almonds, and lentils\n* Vegetables like broccoli and artichoke are great. Think dark leafy greens here. Iceberg lettuce is worthless.\n\nOver the Counter Drugs:\n----\n\n**Miralax:** Miralax is great because it is gentle. You can take a maximum of two capfuls in a day. It is best when dissolved in something warm like your tea or coffee. It works by drawing water into your intestinal tract and in turn, this stimulates a bowel movement.\n\n**Senna**: It is a natural laxative that will work overnight or within 24hrs. It is gentle and has been known to be used for irritable bowel syndrome.\n\n**Colace** is a stool softer and does the same sort of thing Miralax does. Some people find Colace helps more than Miralax others do not. Everyone is different.\n\n\n**Ducalax:**This stimulates your intestines to work faster and ultimately produces a bowel movement in 4-6 hours at the most. It's a great quick way to relieve any kind of sever constipation. However, if you have IBS this might make you cramp and have problems. \n\n**Magnisum Citrate:** If you can stomach drinking it this will do the trick quick! It takes maybe 30 minutes and your gut is moving. Doctors sometimes ask patients to drink this after they finish the prep for a colonoscopy to ensure that everything is out.\n\n**Enemas:** If you feel it there, but can't get that final push through, use an enema. It's no worse than plugging and really does work. Be careful though, you can become dependent on enemas. Only use them every so often as a last resort. Do not use more than 1 a day otherwise you will get dehydrated and that causes problems..\n\n\nPrescription:\n----------\n\n**Linzess:** Primarily used for IBS-C it produces a good movement without too much effort. Problem is after about 2 weeks it starts to lose its effects and is no longer effective.\n\n**Movantik:** It's naloxegel. Basically well, [read this](https:\/\/www.movantikhcp.com\/about-movantik\/mechanism-of-action.html) It explains it much better than I can. \n\n","343":"Hey guys, it is almost 4am and I can't sleep.

At this very moment I\u2019m being considered for an executive position with a massive company that is world famous. \n\nNow, if only someone could shut the crow that has been stalking my porch up \u2013 I\u2019d be exceptionally happy. Being woken up at 5am by this bird is starting to drive me bananas.\n","345":"As you all may (or may not) remember, I celebrated my brother\u2019s 25th birthday roughly a month ago &amp; I told the story of his death despite it being his birthday.\n\nEvery year on his birthday my family makes a donation somewhere that would\u2019ve meant something to him. In the past it has been to places like animal shelters.  This year I called my parents up and got $50 from each of them. I also got $50 of my own money scraped together (goodness knows how) and we made our donation. It went to supply this subreddit with $150 to help supply a months worth of [Tracey\u2019s Narcan Packages](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/3lzt4f\/care_packages_update\/), which have proven time and time again to save the lives of people who struggle with addiction. It\u2019s impressive that she\u2019s saved over 140 lives and my family and I are proud to have been able to have a piece of that.\n\nI spent time debating for the past month whether or not to make this public knowledge here. I finally (obviously) came to the conclusion that making this public knowledge was important. Not only to raise awareness for [Tracey](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/97e91zmT6q\/) and [all the good](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/3qx2vb\/140_saves\/) [she does](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/3tfqb2\/question\/), but to celebrate life.\n\nTo celebrate my brother\u2019s life, I mean what good is it if his impact isn\u2019t heard and seen? I started posting here about a year ago on my brother\u2019s birthday and the day he died. This is the 2nd year I\u2019ve done it and I intend to post on those two days of the year on his behalf in the future and years to come. \n\n1.

Get a Narcan package and be as safe as you possibly can be. &amp; most importantly - Good Luck out there. ","346":"The day seemed to go smoothly. I spent a few hours on campus, dropped off the final and skipped out on class. I remember being confronted by the teacher\u2019s assistant, \u201cWhy are you leaving early?\u201d  he barked at my friend and I as we attempted to leave the 300-student lecture hall. I responded with, \u201cI\u2019ve got a class to drop and family business to take care of. I\u2019ve attended every lecture and I need to go.\u201d He couldn\u2019t keep me there and I left.\n\nHe seemed puzzled by my commitment to family, that family was more important to me than school. I remember him protesting to me, lecturing me that family, places to be, and things to do would always be there. That I should seize hold of my education and opportunity ahead of me.\n\nAt that moment I agreed with him, and to be honest, I was just being a terrible student in that moment.\n\nIt was the end of the term, I was having a good day and I didn\u2019t feel like sitting through the professor\u2019s last lecture. The class had been a complete bore the entire term. All he did was discuss his missed dreams of Hollywood and tell melodramatic stories about what could have been. I wasn\u2019t about to miss out on life happening right now to listen to him moan about how it did not happen for him.\n\nAfter leaving the classroom and getting home, I received a call from my father. He wanted to talk. I had no idea what was going on. \n\nWhen they arrived, I saw my mother\u2019s face, a picture of distress and anguish, an expression that is the definition of pure anguish, and without words I reached out to hug her, knowing something was horribly amiss. But before I could dive in for that hug, dad touched my shoulder and simply said, \u201cHe's dead.\u201d I crumpled to the ground in what was a collapse in tears of incomprehensible grief.\n\nSomehow we made it to my couch.  I don\u2019t think, sitting on that couch that afternoon on November 30th, 2010, anything had ever been as dreadful and heartbreaking to me as that single moment in time. From there, time passed over like a glossy, unreal film. A young, seemingly healthy 20-year-old boy was dead, and it wasn\u2019t any 20-year-old boy\u2014it was my parent\u2019s son and my brother. \n\nI packed up my bags, knowing I\u2019d be staying in the family home for a little bit now. I felt as though I were on autopilot as tears faded and shock immediately set in.\nYou see he died from a Heroin overdose. He was cold upon discovery. He died alone in his room. I'll never get to see his kids or meet his girlfriend. I will never be able to lean on him and I will never be able to let him lean on me. I never got to celebrate his 21st birthday with him and I\u2019ll never get to tease him about turning 30. All I have is 20 precious years that were far more valuable than I could have thought.\n\nGuys, be careful out there, if you have not done so already I urge you to get a kit from \/u\/traceyh415. Her program is life saving and I only wish my brother had his own kit. I miss him terribly. I wish he was here everyday. I\u2019ll tell you when you lose someone close, it doesn\u2019t matter how much time has gone by. 5years later it is still as painful as the day it happened. The only real difference is that I have better ways of coping and dealing with the pain. Otherwise, I\u2019d be a puddle of mush day in and day out. Be careful and be safe out there. \n\n*NOTE: I know a lot of people here have a bit of hate here towards myself. I am posting this because today would be my brother's 25th birthday. He died when he was 20 years old from a Heroin overdose if just one person here thinks twice or* ***gets a kit from \/u\/traceyh415 - I know I'll have done my part.*** *Drama or not, its worth it to me to post and leave this reminder.*\n","347":"I really spent some time debating if it was worth it for me to post here or not. I originally had a plan to post on October 24th and November 29th to commemorate the life and death of my brother due to Heroin. \n\nHowever, I'm back a bit sooner with some very sad news. My older cousin in her late 20s was found almost a week ago on Thursday. It is unknown what her cause of death is at this point in time is. However, there is a very strong chance that it was a Heroin Overdose. Back in May, I reconnected with her after not being in contact for over a decade. \n\nIn fact the last memory of her I have aside from the recent past was when I was about 11 or 12. \n\nShe grew into a beautiful adult. Despite her struggles she was supposedly clean. She constantly would reassure her mother that she would never die of an overdose. That people who die, die because they start out at their old dosage and that causes them to die. She knew better and if a relapse occurred she would take it slow and deal with it. She also swore to her mother that there was no way she'd ever go back to Heroin.\n\nYou see 3years after my brother died, so did hers, due to a diabetes complication (unrelated to drugs). \n\nWe reconnected back in May. No longer children, but adults who have seen more than most do in a lifetime. It felt good to have her around. We seemed more like sisters and for me, the idea of being left alone without my brother seemed to evaporate because she would be there for me and I would be there for her. We got really close really quick. \n\nWe would talk almost daily by phone or text message. We had long talks about everything as we got super close in the recent past. \n\nI was just scrolling through my messages with her. We were discussing AA Meetings because she wanted me to go with her. I turned her down because, I felt  it would be too triggering for me and that I would feel like a misfit with my pain condition that requires medication. \n\nDuring this conversation, I took the plunge and mentioned this SubReddit. She confirmed she had an account and would participate here in the past, but hadn't been here recently. \n\nI will update if I find her username... soon as I get into town for the services I will see if her aunt will allow me to see her laptop. If you have a female facebook friend who has passed away recently and their name begins with an \"L\" please feel free to PM me. I would be very grateful to know about it. Seeing as there is a likelihood it was her. \n\nI'm sorry I don't have her username. I just know she was a member of the community and is now gone. I can't even comprehend it.\n\nThere's a chance this wasn't a drug overdose, that it was a freak thing. Only time will tell, but it probably was an overdose.\n\nFor all the users and members of the community that have suffered a loss or death due to drugs, may you find peace.\n\nEDIT: This is a blanket comment for anyone who feels they need to harass me. I honestly thought about posting this under a throwaway, for fear of being ridiculed yet again. Apparently, I'm super controversial here.\n\nJust to keep things transparent, yes there's been some drama. Yes, I posted [this](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/3clrg0\/see_ya_later_fuckers_the_ride_was_great\/) almost 3 months ago. \n\nYes, I decided to post today in light of recent events. Mainly to see if anyone could possibly pair me up with her username and a reminder that NO ONE is immune from a drug overdose. All it takes is just a little bit too much or a bad cut to end up dead.\n\nI made this post to inform, the community of a loss of life. Regardless of everything I felt it was important to share. Especially, since my cousin was a member of the SubReddit.\n\nNow, with that said, you'll probably hear from me on October 24th and November 29th in remembrance of my brother. I feel strongly that if just one person here gets something out of the mistakes made by those around me, then the hate is absolutely worth it.\n\nIf you don't like it, use RES to put me on ignore and\/or just downvote and move on. That is all.","348":"I know these posts are hated. I honestly do NOT give a flying fuck anymore. I'm obviously severely disliked\/hated\/unwelcomed here. I'm gonna jet. This will be my ***LAST*** post in this SubReddit. \n\nI will not be responding to any messages here.\n\nI'm sorry, but the hate around here isn't worth being a member of the community.\n\nSo \/u\/annoyingopiates and others you have achieved your goal... I'll leave you all alone.\n\nTo those who have been kickass and awesome, thank you so much for a great ride. I have made some valuable friendships. If you need to get ahold of me feel free to PM me. Most of you (&amp; You know who you are) can get ahold of me in other ways.\n\nThis isn't anything against \/r\/opiates - just those who make this place so bitter that it isn't worth it. I am of the opinion that if the internet is upsetting you - it's time to take a fucking break from it and this subreddit has been the source of a great deal of negative feelings. I no longer come on excited to share or help out and offer what I know. \n\nInstead, I worry about being *judged,* *yelled at,* *downvoted,* and *ridiculed.*\n\nSee you all in another life.","349":"So, I have been under an incredibly stressful few days. Basically to sum it up my therapy team started making a lot of outlandish claims:\n\n*\"You're eating food daily when you're not supposed to be!\"*\n\n*\"You're not following your pain pill script! You're abusing the medications!\"*\n\n*\"You're lead surgeon lied to make himself look good, you don't really have a GI Disorder!\"*\n\nJust to name a few of the weird things I've heard in this parallel universe over the last two days. My parents were brought in on all of this and it was the last claim that I don't \"really have a GI disorder\" that damaged the credibility of the Psychiatrist making that statement. \n\nI handed the psychiatrist my medical records that state there was a test done and it was positive. Something I could not fake even if I wanted to. He didn't seem to give a damn and I was pissed. \n\nAnyway, we sat down as a family today and decided to ***not*** put me in Rehab, especially since my pain doctor is okay with me being on the medications I am on. My Pain Doctor today was really happy that I was off the Lyrica, Tramadol and Topamax. He also validated my illness stating he had reviewed the operative reports and knows what a difficult thing what I have can be.\n\nI expressed that I'm sure there's some level of psychosis alongside all fo the medical stuff ad at some point pain and whatnot can be amplified but so long as I remain in therapy with my trusted psychiatrist (not the 2nd opinion or the therapy team) he feels I will be good!\n\nSuch a fucking relief. I can't even. ","350":"So, I saw a psychiatrist that I was hoping would have some brains to do a consult with in regards on how to handle my medical &amp; physiatric issues. I don't deny that I have a physiatrist history or anything of the sort.\n\nI just feel that this psychiatrist who originally promised to look at my medical records as well as my psych history only took into account my psych records and not my medical history.\n\nUpon asking him what he thought of the surgical reports he was just like, \"I don't think anything was wrong and that operation should have been performed.\" He went on to say that my surgeon, \"was overreaching in his diagnosis in order to make himself look better and unlike he did an unnecessary surgery.\" Which, is a load of bullshit and an audacious claim. Especially from someone who did not read that operative report or look at those documents at all.\n\nIt just felt like he was chraging us a ton of money to blow smoke up my ass. \n\nHe claims that if I take different medications for my depression my pain and physical wellbeing will get better. I disagree strongly. There is no medication that makes this better. I require a multipronged approach from all aspects and closing the door on viable treatment options be it pain management, GI medications or whatever and replacing it with antipsychotics and therapy is a bad idea.\n\nThis isn't all or nothing. I want to take a multipronged approach to this use pain medication, therapy, antidepressants etc. together to achieve a wellbeing.\n\nWhat people fail to see is I'm finally somewhat happy. I'm doing *well* I'm not broken at the moment to a point where it is making me unhappy. There is no denying I am broken since I can't eat but making false promises that if I do certain things without narcotics I can eat again just seems shortsighted. \n\nI don't want to gamble on a fix that could make me worse. \n\nThe current regime is working. Why fuck with it? I did this under the pressure of my family and a psych team that I am just about ready to fire. \n\nI think starting today I'm making my own medical decisions and building my team appropriately. \n\nI know some of you are going to come in here and challenge me about all of this. I am very stressed right now and will be explicit with what I need right now:\n\n(1) Support &amp; Understanding - not to be confused with pity party or sympathy\n\n(2) Practical advice or what you would do if you were faced with my situation.\n\n(3) Please do not patronize me, I just don't need it right now\n\n(4) No tough love - I'm not in the mood to hear \"harsh realiities\"\n\n(5) Take a caring approach with kindness\n\n(6) I don't want you to bullshit me but please don't be harsh. I don't need that either.\n\n(7) If you only have mean things to say or \"I told you so\" keep your trap shut. ","351":"*I feel like doing something nice\/fun.

As many of you know I'm not in my regular city\/state. Instead, I'm visiting elsewhere,  well while in elsewhere I've been panicking and having some issues with potentially running out of my narcotic script.\n\nI even posted a little bit ago about how I might go about getting an emergency supply and decided against contacting my doctor about that for fear he may find things highly suspicious or think that I ran out of my script too early and just needed an early refill or whatever. \n\nAnyway, I ended up with some bad vomiting last night and was forced to go to the ER where I am visiting. I started the visit off by just getting the necessary medications - zofran, fluids, torodol just until labs and XRays came back etc., etc., to see if I'd be justified to accept narcotics.\n\nAnyway, my XRay came back showing severe Gastroenteritis. The doctor at the ER administered a total of 2mg of IV Dialudid and wrote for a script of 20 5\/325oxycodones for the increased pain I'm expected to have over the next 2-3weeks. \n\nSo, today I called my regular pain doctor before filling the script and led with, *\"I wont fill this if you don't want me to...\"* My pain doctor thanked me for calling him and said it would be fine to fill the script and that I did the right thing by going to the ER. \n\nI thanked him for being reasonable and just explained that I didn't want to go against his orders. He seemed really receptive of that and was just great overall.\n\nNot that he would've been bad had he said no to my request - I just would have dealt with it and suffered through, but finally having a doctor on my side who is willing to treat me like a respectable human is excellent.\n\nLike so much relief right &amp; now I can enjoy my trip without stressing!\n\nxxx,\n\nDori\n\n","355":"I'm just wondering in this atypical hypothetic if this would work\/be okay:\n\nI'm thinking of getting in touch with my pain doctor to see if he'll write me a bit of an extended perscription because, I am fearful that I am going to be out of my perscription before my next appointment.\n\nThing is I am out of state from my hometown and won't be back in my state until just a few days before my next appointment.\n\nSo I do not want to bother my doctor if this can't happen - hence why I'm asking here....\n\nCan my doctor write a pen &amp; paper prescription for Oxycodone to be picked up by my family and then my family member can drop the prescription off at a big chain pharmacy (like CVS\/Walgreens\/Etc...) from there I could maybe called the pharmacy in my current area\/state and they can pull &amp; fill that script here for me?\n\nOr is that just completely impossible.\n\nI know I recently had 5 prescriptions filled here using that method but none of those were narcotics. \n\nPlease Advise Thanks!","356":"I swear to fucking junkie jesus this has *got* to be in my head at this point.

I saw a new pain doctor to whom I spoke very candidly to. Told him about the bullshit, the shit I've been through and that I've just been dragging myself along best I can. \n\nThis pain doctor is **NO BS** ... he took one list of my long list of medications and was just like, *wtf, why are you on 4 different non-narcotic pain medication that aren't doing shit?!* and I was kinda like, \"that's been my arguement but no one seems to want to touch it\/listen to me about it and my previous pain doctor was dead set against scripting narcotics because of my brother's death.\" \n\nFor context purposes my brother died 5years ago of a Heroin Overdose and my previous pain doctor felt that addiction was something that was inevitable for me if he were to prescribe me a pain med so instead he had me on 3-5 non-narcotic pain medications to \"manage\" the situation. I finally got frustrated with him when he started pushing AA Meetings on me when I had never had an issue with drug abuse or encounter with opiates outside of a doctor perscribed setting and dropped him as a doctor. \n\nSo, this new doctor who was referred to me by my blood doctor who is a prominent cancer specialist (I don't have cancer - just iron issues) really listened to me and felt that it was appropriate to remove the Lryica, Topamax, Tramadol, &amp; potentially the Linzess and replace it with a low dose of Baclofen and an Oxycodone 5mg PRN Script.\n\nIn fact he was ready to put me on Oxy's daily &amp; we discussed how that should be a thing eventually, but for the time being if we can put that off for as long as possible - then that is going to be the best bet. So I got a small script, nothing huge, but it's a big deal to me a bottle of 30 5mg IR Oxycodone tablets to last me 6weeks. The instruction reads to take \"1-2 as needed for pain\" \n\nThis is a dream for me. It will keep me out of that damned ER and will help me deal with the pain on a manageable level. I can handle a 3-5 sometimes even a 6 on the pain scale. It's when it jumps to a 7-9 that I am really suffering and this script is going to tackle those days when my pain is at 7+. I'm literally so relieved I could cry. In fact, I think I'm going to go ahead and cry. It's been a long ass journey and hopefully they're finally willing to manage my situation. Maybe my team is finally falling into place.\n\nThere is hope.\n\nxxx,\n\nDori\n\nPS: For those who do not know, I have a feeding tube, I have a rare disorder that causes chronic pancreatitis. The feeding tube helps with this, but I still have pain from the original disorder + having a tube surgically implanted into my body.

Unfortunately, he is not in a position to prescribe me any kind of pain medication. So, instead he's been working on finding out why these doctors do not wish to take on my case and\/or why they will not prescribe me pain medication.\n\n***They think I might be suicidal and may kill myself with said pain medication script...***\n\nThis pisses me off for a number of reasons:\n\n1) It's insulting\n\nGreat. Now, that's out of the way. Of course, it's insulting, now what? Well, it is also valid. As well as disappointing that no one has felt comfortable enough to address this with me directly. Instead it has been thought that I be better left in the dark about it, left wondering and confused. That in and of itself is infurriating. \n\nBut, back to valid. Yes, I have a history of sucicidality. Once when I was 16 (10 years ago) and another time just after my brother died (4years ago) when you look at my history of actual suicidality and what took place, I always reached out for help and there was never an attempt on my own life accidental or otherwise. So, yes it is valid, yes I have a history of depression &amp; mental illness, yes it is well managed, yes I am under the care of a therapy team &amp; a psychiatrist, no have none of my pain management specialist ever wished to reach out to said people. Which, is just *irresponsible* in my opinion if they are going to deny a legit pain patient pain medication for that reason without consulting their psych team...\n\nWell then my blood doctor made a very valid point to me, **\"these specialists are just as responsible for overtreating you as they are for undertreating you - if you buy off the street and die, they are still at fault insurance wise. They think they're covering their asses however, they are not.\"**\n\nWhich, is great and all. But eghhhgwwads it so does not help me right now. \n\nMy pain doctor then made a second referral to an outside pain management specialist who I now have an appointment with for later on in the month. Hoping to hell he takes me on and works with me. Otherwise, I'm pretty much at the end of my rope suffering wise. \n\nIt doesn't help that my brother died of a Heroin Overdose either.

My best shot at survival is being food free with my feeding tube. Makes me wonder if being alive is worth it.\n\nAnyway, I'm here defeated. Not here to argue about what a jackass X doctor is or what injustice has been done this time. Just simply defeated. I'm not here to get heated about the details of my story. 'nor am I here to do much more than just close this chapter so ya. For those following my story -- looks like I'm some kinda medical piranha. go figure.","362":"Hey \/r\/Opiates!\n\nHope Everyone is doing fantastic! Firstly, sincerely apologize; I know I've been posting a lot of negative crap about my medical stuff and that is just so upsetting, stressful and quite frankly accomplishes nothing but allows for an outlet to vent. \n\nToday, I just felt like talking about something that might be useful to the entire community. No matter where in this game you are I hope you can appreciate the idea behind this. Even if it just gets your brain thinking about how you can improve on other aspects of your life. \n\nPersonally, I struggle with a lot of negative thoughts and anxiety. Especially considering the mountain I am ~~climbing~~ stuck under with my medical crapola. \n\nI've found that it doesn't always cut it to just breathe, listen to music or watch TV. Sometimes, I need to be a bit more proactive than that. \n\nLately, I've been doing a thing.\n\nYes. **A thing.**\n\nA thing where, I've come up with a mantra\/saying\/something to say. I actually have a few as follows as an example:\n\n* Living in the past or future does nothing for me. Today is a gift taht is why it is called the present.\n* I am beauty &amp; brains\n* I stick by my values: Health, Family, Friends, Giving Back\n* I refuse to be put in a box and labeled. \n* My identity is fluid. \n* Emotions change every 15minutes or so, lets see how I feel then.\n\nI actually have them *written* down and posted in my kitchen!\n\nThe next step after I took some time to create this list that I could believe\/buy into\/understand\/achieve, I went about my day normally, except when I'd catch myself thinking about \"what a dumb fuck I am\" I'd pause and take a deep breath before letting it really hurt me in that same moment of taking a breath I'd pull from my statement\/affirmations and go, \"I am beauty and brains\"\n\nBAM! POW! CHICAWOWOW! \n\nInstantaneous mood boost.  \n\nSo my challenge to you is to (1) Tell me (or not!) 1-3 mantras and\/or sayings designed for you, that you believe you can actually use and be excited about using. (2) Do it once this weekend and just make a mental note on how you felt after you tried it. Did you go back to the situation\/group? Did you feel empowered? (3) Write down anything from 1 word to thousands of pages focusing on what, why, when, how, where. \n\nDefine yourself outside of being whatever it is that you dislike (or even do like). Just like I am not my physical illness you are not whatever issue is stressing you out at this very moment.\n\nI don't know. I felt compelled to share this knowledge in hopes it helps - I know this type of thinking has gotten me through some pretty terrible days. \n\nStay beautiful \/r\/opiates!","363":"HALP!\n\nI'm not normally an angry person. Tell me about you. Anything about you. I need some sincere distracting from this crap. My old pain clinic has jaded the view of all my other reputable doctors and it has left me in the dust in regards to getting treatment. \n\nNo wonder my GI a few months back thought I needed to go to the psychward and get evaluated, which I did and they told my GI if my pain was better managed I wouldn't be a psych case anymore, and my GI had me take that inforamtion to my new pain doctor who told me that the psych people just were passing the buck on me. That he cared. So he offered a few things to try and I have been giving them an honest shot.\n\nEverytime I walk into my current pain doctors office he tells me about how I'm too high risk for addiction, how because of everything I've been through, I'm just too high of a risk and I was assuming he meant my brother... he told me to go to an AA meeting or an NA meeting this last visit....\n\nI reacted by telling him that I thought it'd make me really sad to remember my brother like that and I'd think about it. \n\nIt wasn't till I was home thinking about it that I picked up the phone and found out I had been dismissed from my old pain clinics care. I wasn't simply discharged from my old pain doctor I was dismissed. I asked what the difference was and was finally told that it was on record I had broken my pain contract.\n\nI explained, I was *discharged*, with a referral to try suboxone offlabel , ***for pain,*** and that the doctor then never mentioned anything about breaking my pain contract. That I was never told I had done this, that it did take me awhile to go ahead and try the subxone because, it was a \"scary\" drug for me and that I had seizure on it and informed their offices of said seizure and was told it was merely a suggestion to go ahead and try suboxone and that they could no longer help me. \n\nThat whatever was in their notes about the way I was discharged or what had happened has been negatively impacting the way I receive care in the ER is truly traumatic and that I've been struggling day in and day out for a long 6months off all narcotics with the exception of 7 ER visits and 3 Hospitalizations in 6 months. \n\nSadly, that is the lowest number of hospital encounters in recent times than ever before....\n\nThey seemed surprised that I haven't had a script at home since August. Said, they'd look into it further and would get back to me. I'm just hurt. Really hurt and hurting.\n\nI'm just so blood boiling angry. I don't know. Tell me about you.","364":"Ugh. I don't even know how this is possible. I developed a sore throat around 7pm and for some reason no matter what I do I can't get comfy enough to get to sleep. It is now almost 3:30am and I haven't slept a wink. I'm a bit worried because I have a 10:30am appointment and my day is go, go, go from then till 3 in the afternoon. Ugh. FML. I'm not withdrawing from anything or even currently using. \n\nI seriously hope I'm not coming down with some kind of strange sore throat. It is the last thing I need just after I was starting to feel better emotionally and everything.\n\nI even took a bit of Ativan and it didn't knock me out. Ugh. Maybe just the stress about all the crap with my medical stuff is finally eating at me bad enough to keep me up all night that along with the soreness of my throat and the runny tummy I have from the antibiotic just has me screwed up. \n\nAnyway, how everyone? What's your latest and greatest? Tell me about your day\/week\/month. What's your story?","365":"Hey Guys!!!\n\nSo, the bad news first:\n\nI had a super discouraging doctors appointment. He was way overly judgmental. Saying shit like that my ER Visit was not a good thing and that he understands I'm in pain but that I need to work through going to the ER. I pointed out that it had been 6weeks since I last visited the hospital and last time I stayed for 2days and this time I left the ER after 12hrs so that was an improvement from this time last year when I was in the ER like weekly. \n\nIt just pissed me off because he told me to be great its not about what you have achieved but its about what you're going to achieve. Which my mom liked, for whatever reason, but I hated it. Because, I have come so far and I have done really well and I have followed his lead (for the most part). He wasn't my doctor a year ago when things were horrid so I don't think he realizes what a huge accomplishment this was for me.\n\nAlso, he bitched about my weight for a long ass time because, I guess the high triglyceride levels in my body from sudden weight gain can contribute to my pancreatic pain. (I've gained about 30lbs in 3months). So, he lectured me quite a bit. I took it with stride - I've struggled with my weight for most of my young adult life so now that I'm in my mid-twenties - I know all about it &amp; the simple equation to loose weight. I get it. I have no excuse my caloric intake is perfectly measured to the last small calorie because of my feeding tube. &amp; I just need to actually work out vs. just walking the dog leisurely. He wants me to work up a sweat 15minutes per day but that so is not going to happen at least not anytime soon. He claimed my current regime with the dog is for like 60-80year olds and that I'm 25 so I should be doing more. *Should've, Would've, Could've,* I mean REALLY!?\n\nAnyway, now good news:\n\nI was able to get a back supply of my stuff. My guy got it to me in an exceptionally fast manner and put me on the honor system fronting me just a small amount (which, I have since paid up). So, that was excellent. So, even though my pain doctor wont help narcotic wise - I'm at least covered for the next 20 days before I have to do withdrawals etc., to pass my drug test at my stupid pain doctors office next time. \n\n&amp; In other news my pain doctor did put me on topamax (aka dopeamax because, it gives you brain fog), and that helps with weightloss + pain typically migraine type pain which could help my small headaches and potentially my pancreatic pain - we will see. So that's good. Not only that but I got my supply of celebrex too, so with starting that we should see a difference pain wise. *fingers crossed!!!*\n\nHe also mentioned that my weight gain could be partially due to the increase in Lyrica so having the topamax to combat that will be super useful.\n\nIn other good news - my boyfriend bought a plane ticket out to see me again in May &amp; him + me might meet up in Vegas in April so all of that stuff is good and exciting.\n\nOverall, my quality of life has drastically improved and I'm just so happy about that. It's just hard dealing with the severe daily pain, but like I said at least I'm covered till my next drug test. For those wondering why I take 10days to withdraw vs. 3 or 5 is to leave buffer room for slipping up and needing something within the first 5days and then I have an extra 5days to just be clean + it helps with keeping my tolerance in check and not only that it is financially beneficial so yah. yep. It sucks but it works!\n\nJust felt like sharing iono. Didn't expect to write so freaking much. Anyway stay beautiful \/r\/opiates!!!\n\nxxx,\n\nDori","366":"Hey All You Awesome Folks!\n\nYou may remember [my last post here,](http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/2xhzlz\/idgf_anymore\/) where I was all kinds of depressed and struggling with withdrawal. Anyway, now things are better. I'm out of that crazy withdrawal phase of things and am doing pretty okay. \n\nSo smiles for all :-)\n\nIn any other news, IDK. I might have a boyfriend now. So that is something &amp; I'll catch all you fun folk on TinyChat yea yeah? \n\n:-)\n\nOh &amp; as far as the drugs go - I'm not sure if I'm gonna keep up this crazy cycle of 10days off 20days on per month with the Oxycodones. I'll have to see what my pain doc wants to do with me first. But, yah I'm considering just biting the bullet and dealing with the pain on a more holistic level but I do want stuff in stock for those crazy emergencies. So yeppers.\n\n^ _ ^","367":"I'm really feeling depressed. Withdrawing from Oxy atm. I need to pass my drug test in 10days and I ran out early so here I am detoxing. Fuck this shit so much.

Lemme know.","368":"I like the idea of being clean and off drugs. I like the idea of not being in pain and being able to manage. I love the idea of saving money. I wish to be clean. Just like I wish to be healthy. Unfortunately, I am not healthy and I am not clean. I'm going to take a leap of faith. I want to feel better. I'm going to try to get clean and just do it. No matter the physical pain consequences. I just can't be fogged out all the time anymore. \n\nIt just sucks. It breaks my heart to post this for some reason. IDK why. It just does. I guess I just really wish my doctors would take me seriously. Living with what I have isn't easy and more than that I just want to be okay.","369":"Hey guys!\n\nIn case any of you were wondering what might've happened to me *cough*\/u\/NoTimeLikeToday*cough*\/u\/kittykins89*cough*\/u\/pinkpixie81*cough* I am doing fantastic.

We decided not to hanky panky this trip but I'm looking forward to future trips where we can be togehter and even more intimate. :-) It's so nice to actually have someone I care about around. I hope he sticks around. ^ _ ^ anyway, yep. That's where I've been. I've been distracted by the opposite sex. \n\nTo those who don't know me this might seem awkward but yah.

I've got a feeding tube and my doctors aren't great. Which has resorted to me using an old back supply of opiates but I have to be clean for 10days prior to my pain doctor appointments for drug testing. I know I can go less but I need to be 100% clean and they lab test it so I leave 10days as a good buffer every month + it helps my tolerance.\n\nAnyway talk soon! Tell me something interesting about you!","371":"I may or may not be drug tested at my pain doctors office. I've been on 7.5mg - 20mg of oxycodone. My last dose was 7.5mg about 24hrs ago. \n\nMy appointment is on the 13th of January. There is NO WAY I can test \"dirty\" for oxycodone at this appointment. How many days before the appointment should I stay off the oxycodone? I have been reading that its 3-4days for it to get out of the urine but if its a really important test then give it 5days. \n\nIs this accurate? Also does the amount of water consumption make a difference?","372":"He would be 24 today. Today is October 24th, 2014. He would be 24.\n\nOn November 29th, 2010 he passed away from a Heroin Overdose. It is suspected that he had injected himself and missed and then did another hit to get high. Later on the first one that he missed caught up with the dose that he got right and it slowed his respiratory rate and eventually caused him to die. The coroner said, *\"I just don't understand, he had barely enough to kill himself with it. This should not have happened.\"* He died alone upstairs in his room.\n\n**He was my younger brother dead at 20 and I was left hopeless at 22**. We never knew he was on Heroin. We never knew what was happening or how deep into drugs he really was. We thought at best he was into Cannabis and a few pills here and there. We thought it was all manageable. We were wrong.\n\nI'll never forget that day finding out. Or the fact that the night he died was the night of my parents 23rd wedding anniversary.\n\nJust a reminder to stay safe out there. Just stay safe.\n\n*Edit 10\/24\/14 @ 5pm PST: I just wanted to say thank yo so much to everyone for your amazing well wishes. If anything comes of this it serves as a great reminder to be careful out there. Also if you want to get clean then I recommend it highly. There is nothing more unfortunate than losing your life to your drug addiction. I've seen what it does to the family\/friends and it's not pretty.*","373":"Hey,\n\nSo, I thought I'd be better. My doctors told me I would be better. That I should be excited about going off my pain medications and that there was no reason for my pain. I took my last dose of 2.5mg of Oxycodone Saturday. I vomited a bit last week but it was okayish. Today, I've vomited 5times and the pain is killing me. I've taken Tylenol and my prescribed tramadol only to vomit that up again.  \n\nI'm on a feeding tube. I haven't had any food in a year. I fear that while the tube helps it is by no means a cure. Like my doctor thinks it is. \n\nI'm just sobbing, I feel like such a failure for needing the narcotics, but who am I kidding? I'm not getting any today. Unless, if I go to the ER but now I have a dog to take care of. I love him to death. He's helped me so much these past two weeks. \n\nNo one needs to live in such pain. I don't understand why my doctors feel this insane need to deny me a quality of life. I am a lab rat.","374":"Hey \/r\/Opiates,\n\nI've been through the mill and back again. I developed a painful pancreatic condition in my early 20s and it has followed me for years. Now, my doctors are insisting I get off my pain medication. That it wasn't helping anything. Only making this worse. At first I wI had a lot of resentment and stubborn about it and refused to do it. \n\nUntil 10days ago. I adopted a dog. He is a total love bug and when I'm in pain he curls up on me or next to me. This dog lowers all my anxiety, blood pressure and heart rate. Thus allowing my pain to be very minimal. This week has been incredible and I cannot wait to get my life back together with my dog in tow.\n\nI am on 5mg of oxy tomorrow is my last dose at that dosage. Then, the next four days are half pills or about 2.5mg of oxycodone. I'm so excited about this. Even though I had so much resistance to the plan originally, with this dog - things are so much better. :-) I now get a fair shot at life!","375":"Hey! \n\nSo, I have chronic pain issues. Has anyone ever heard of Suboxone being used for pain? What was the experience like? I just saw a Suboxone doctor who specializes in it for pain but, he doesn't take my insurance and was $545 for today's visit. Fucking outrageous. It really, really, really sucked.\n\nThis doctor treats patients with pain issues specifically with Suboxone. He also works with a few Heroin addicts as well, but it is not a clinic, it is a doctors office where this is his specialty and he's an internist.\n\nI have chronic abdominal pain from a rare bile duct disorder (It's kinda like Crohns with a ton of pancreatitis episodes)....\n\nThe doctor obviously gave me a lot of information but I was wondering if anyone here is on it for pain or knows someone who is\/was on it for pain and what happened with them? What kind of pain condition was\/is present and if there's EXTRA pain or \"FLARES\" how does Suboxone work\/help?\n\nInsights are greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nDori","376":"So my last dose of Methadone was the 22nd of May and my last Oxycodone dose was Friday the 20th of June. I did have to take some Oxycodone on Tuesday the 24th of June due to a Gastroinstinal bleed that was causing pain and then on Thursday the 26th of June around 1am I was treated in the ER for the bleed and they gave me Dilaudid but, I feel like Tuesday\/Thursdays uses were warranted.\n\nIt is now Saturday and my Gastrointestinal symptoms are under control and so is the pain. (last real pain med dose was Wednesday night\/early Thursday morning) I still have bad abdominal pain, but I'm learning to breathe\/be off the narcotics with it. I'm slowly but surely noticing improvements.\n\nThe methadone withdrawals were intense and triggered some psychotic issues for me but I managed to stay home and was able to deal with it. Then came the oxycodone withdrawals and I swear the biggest thing with that was my runny nose for days on end. Right now I'm just on a muscle relaxant and Tylenol and it seems to be pretty much doing the job.\n\nAnyway, just wanted to share my story in case anyone could relate\/was going off stuff themselves while in chronic pain. It is possible to get clean and not use narcotics everyday and more as a rescue medication. So yah. xD.","377":"So, I tried to jump off about two weeks ago from a 2.5mg dose and had to go back on it. Now, I am jumping off again and it hasn't been easy. I jumped off at 1.25 and for the first 2 days it was at least manageable. Then yesterday, day 3 I flipped a  lid. \n\nEvery bone in my body hurt and to make things worse I was experiencing auditory hallucinations. Mind you I'm prone to those so it wasn't that much of a surprise and I'm proud of my parents for helping me make it though the night. It sure wasn't easy with all my shenanigans. \n\nI apparently from what I'm told I dialed 911 twice and my parents spoke to the operator and said I was fine. Apparently they weren't too happy with 2 calls from my household and did not come out.\n\nUltimately I'm glad because I didn't end up wasting a week of my life at the hospital and am a lot better today but getting through last night was absolute murder between the bone pain and auditory hallucinations.\n\nHowever, I have parents who love me dearly and they both slept next to me and kept rubbing my body to help the bone pain and to soothe me. So they are kinda awesome.\n\nIt sucks having this disability and when my parents no longer exist I will have to go to the hospital but right now I understand they are here for me and can help me greatly.\n\nRight now I'm looking into an IOP and just getting back ontrack. The hallucinations are gone and the withdrawals and becoming less and less severe. Although god damn bone pain is the worst.\n\nAnyway it is day 4 going on day 5 and the hallucinations are gone.The bones still hurt but I figure once I sleep that'll go away - we'll see and overall I'm starting to feel better.

So I was on a tolerance break, made it to day 3 which isn't bad, when I started vomiting like crazy. I was taken to the Emergency Room loaded up on IV Dialudid &amp; hospitalized.

Unfortunately, I had a toxic reaction to the continuous epidural &amp; it had to be removed &amp; I was restarted on IV medications. \n\nFrom there I was scheduled for placement of a feeding tube which I now have &amp; then they moved me to oral medications. I'm now on:\n\n* Methadone 5mg upon waking up\n* Oxycodone 10mg Every 3hrs\n* Dialudid 4mg Every 4hrs\n* + An NSAID topical cream that has been helping the muscles spasms around the new feeding tube.\n\nSo I really got chewed up &amp; spit out with this tolerance break. I'm hoping from here things get a lot better. Especially since my medication regime is a lot stronger\/better, I've been a lot more comfortable.

I hate that I get jealous of the new addicts in NA , opiates have fucked me up for life and living life without being dependent is amazing, but holy fuck do I want to use, use, use.","387":"Every year, for the past 9 years, I've made this post on r\/opiates. Here's [last year's post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/jh4an0\/happy_30th_birthday\/). Today is my younger brother's birthday. He would be 31 today. He died when he was 20 years old of a heroin OD. I miss him tons. The pain has never gotten any better. However, this past year I noticed that in my recovery my coping mechanisms for handling the pain is 1,000x better.\n\nI'm not up for making a huge tribute post, but I still wanted to speak on it and make my annual post. So, here it is. \n\nAlso, for anyone and everyone on this subreddit, if no one has told you, and you need to hear it: you are loved, you are worthy, your life is valuable.","388":"I just had to make a post to gush about this. I'm so fucking proud of my friend right now. He's doing all the right things to get his life in order. \n\nWe first met online about 6 or 7 years ago on a drug forum. We never met in person, but we chatted constantly via text and phone calls. We were both in active addiction for the majority of our relationship.\n\nIn the last three years I've been working on getting clean and have almost 15 months of recovery.  Meanwhile, my friend has struggled greatly. I never turned my back on him though. Even with my recovery. I've always been there for him.\n\nThis past summer he ended up kicking in jail for upteenth time and as we talked about it.\n\nWhat if I assisted him with moving him away from his people, places, and things? What would that look like? Was he really done with drugs? \n\nHe expressed interest in coming here and doing rehab and we hatched a plan. We expected it to take till January to really happen because of his legal issues across the country. \n\nWell, he was able to cut a deal for time served in the summer and early August he was sitting in my living room. We got him signed up with social services and within 3 days of arriving he was in a non-profit rehab facility in town that is known to be very good. \n\nI thought for sure he'd run.\n\nHe surprised me and didn't run. Instead he's stayed and he's doing the fucking hard work it takes to recover. I'm just so fucking proud of him. He's been there almost 3 months. He plans to do their outpatient program even! I'm excited for him to be my neighbor and friend in recovery. &lt;3.","389":"It\u2019s Monday\u2026\n\n\u2026&amp; I am doing much [better since my last post.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/oy9vpm\/im_fucking_sad\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf).  It\u2019s funny how when I\u2019m sad, mad, craving or feeling anything negative it seems like it\u2019s never ending. However, I\u2019m learning that the more I resist giving into temptation and do not relapse the stronger I am becoming.  \n\nToday I feel so much better. I got a ton of solid sleep and rest this weekend which was incredibly helpful and I told a few people around me how I was feeling. That really helped me. \n\nI also decided on a whim to start my YouTube channel and just jump into it. That\u2019s definitely a passion project and I just wanted to express that I\u2019m proud of myself for doing it because that\u2019s been a goal of mine all year. I won\u2019t link it here because I\u2019m not into shameless promotion. I just wanted to talk about it a bit.  \n\nIn any event, today is a good day and I thought I\u2019d share something positive versus bitching about the negative.\n\nOpiate addiction is hard to deal with. The lows are plentiful, however the more I resist the \u201cfuck it\u2019s\u201d the better of a person I\u2019m becoming. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing out of the ordinary today.  I\u2019m on my way to work, I will come home, do laundry, browse Reddit and go to bed. It\u2019ll be a relatively boring day and boring isn\u2019t so bad. After all, I\u2019ve lived in chaos for so long it\u2019s nice when things go well.","390":"[Just 6 days ago I celebrated 1 year clean.](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/oubl5f\/today_is_significant\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) So, I feel really weird posting this today, but I gotta keep it real. I\u2019m suffering from extreme depression. I\u2019m beyond upset about it too. It\u2019s been a long road. \n\nFrom an outsiders perspective I have nothing to complain about. \n\nI\u2019m 1 year clean! What an accomplishment! I have an excellent job! People in my life love me! People believe in me! \n\nSomeone believes in me so much that they gave me something very special to them to celebrate my one year and as I graciously accepted it, thought it was cool as fuck, I also got very angry because now it means I can\u2019t relapse. If I do I\u2019ll destroy those around me and well \u2026 myself. \n\nI got angry that people care about me so much that they won\u2019t let me destroy my life.  \n\nI got mad that I care enough to not self destruct.  \n\nI told someone important to me today that I was tired and I felt felt like they dismissed it. \u201cIt\u2019s over 100 degrees here lately. Everyone is tired.\u201d They said. I felt so invalidated.  I kinda shut down a bit. Didn\u2019t want to go into how I\u2019m just depressed. After all, I just need to suck it up and keep on pressing on. Right? Right? \n\nIt\u2019s more than that though.  I\u2019m doing everything possible to handle my depression, I\u2019m on meds, in therapy, working a strong recovery program, being careful about my physical pain, and I plan on getting a full psych evaluation here in the near future and addressing my nutrition but, I can\u2019t help but wonder if it\u2019s worth it because I seem to be programmed to be depressed. I mean if I can\u2019t be happy after being a year clean and all the positivity in my life then what hope is there for me?\n\nI\u2019m not gonna relapse. I\u2019m just pissed off. I\u2019m not a victim. I just need to get this out there. This sounds so woe is me. Which, I know I hate doing.\n\nFuck depression.","391":"Today is significant because I am exactly 1 year clean. For those around here that knew me KNOW that today is a long time coming.\n\nI have been around r\/opiates for 9 whole years. It\u2019s only in the last three years I\u2019ve attempted to recover and it\u2019s only in the last year that I\u2019ve actually stayed clean! \n\nI describe myself as an egomaniac with and inferiority complex. I like attention but god forbid I ask someone for help. Yet\u2026\n\nA year ago today I didn\u2019t plan on not using anymore, I didn\u2019t have a one last use, but in a rare moment of clarity I reached out for help. In that moment I was thrown a life raft and since then I\u2019ve stuck with it. \n\nI have chronic pain. This year has been hard as hell. Heck, even [16 days ago I was convinced I\u2019d relapse](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/comments\/oja0s8\/i_am_insane\/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf), but I didn\u2019t. I stuck with my recovery and things changed. \n\nLife doesn\u2019t always suck. It isn\u2019t always great, but it\u2019s amazing that I can have the presence of mind to be a survivor and not a victim. \n\nXo, Dori","392":"I see the train coming, but I don't have the energy or will to stop it. I feel like a relapse is going to be unavoidable. I've already slipped into old behaviors and patterns. I've started gambling again and I noticed that I'm playing mental gymnastics with myself to justify using again. Right now the latest rationale is, \"get to your one year anniversary and then go do whatever you want.\" or, \"why can't you just start chipping. No one will know. how will they know?\"\n\nI see all of this. I know all of this, yet I don't know if I care enough to not relapse. Sometimes I feel so detached from myself. It's like an out of body experience. It's like I have no control over myself, yet I recognize how wrong I am and have incredible insight into it. I just can't control the compulsion to act out or destroy my life when things are going well.\n\nI became so used to chaos over the course of my life that I find it hard to sit still with me, myself, and I. I'm coming up on a year here at the end of the month and while I'm excited about it, I'm absolutely terrified.","393":"I am an opiate addict and I cannot believe it. This is the longest consecutive amount of clean time I've ever had. I'm really surprised I've made it this far. Especially because of my chronic pain and how I used to be. I was ALWAYS the victim. I hated the idea of NA and the only God that existed was junkie Jesus.\n\nToday, I am empowered. I have found that NA works fantastically for me (go figure) and I am so damn lucky that I survived my addiction thus far because not everyone does. I\u2019ve lost my brother and cousin to addiction and I\u2019ve seen the devastating results of that.\n\nI am proud to be a chronic pain patient in recovery from addiction.\n\nAt 8.5 months clean I was craving badly and it was looking like I wasn't going to make 9 months.\n\nI was ready to cave. I was scheming and scamming and had a whole relapse plan that I intended to carry out. Somehow though, someway, I realized that if I put as much effort into scheming as I might my recovery, I might have a shot.\n\nSo, instead of scheming and scamming as per usual, I tried something different, stepped entirely outside of my comfort zone and moved into a sober living.\n\nIt made all the difference for me. I now have 9 amazing roommates and I love living here for the time being.\n\nAsking for help 8.5 months in wasn't easy too. I knew without any kind of change though, I would relapse. I cannot help but be genuinely proud of myself right now for making it to 9 months.\n\nSo, now it's onto one year and beyond, one day at a time. I can do this.","394":"When I first joined r\/opiates nearly 10years ago 98% of the time it was all about wild stories and pill porn. Also, does anyone remember that mugshot trend we had here 8 or so years ago?\n\nToday it is very different. There\u2019s no pill porn and certainly no one is posting their selfies as mugshots, today there\u2019s a lot more talk about harm reduction and recovery. \n\nOne thing hasn\u2019t changed though everyone here is amazing. I\u2019ve met some of the best people on this subreddit over the years. \n\nJust wanted to share.","395":"I'm definitely obsessed with using. To the point where my brain goes, *\"don't take those antibiotics for your infection! Let it fester and you'll have a reason to accept drugs in the hospital when it gets really bad!\"* Yeah. It's fucking terrifying being inside my brain sometimes. Anyway, the next thought was, *\"Shut the fuck up, your guilt will consume you if you do that. If you're gonna go to those kinds of lengths it's easier to pick up on the streets.\"* So now here I am with all these ~~bright~~ stupid ideas, left thinking to myself, *\"WTF is wrong with you. Sthap. Just take your fucking antibiotic and stop trying to think up ways to self destruct.\"*\n\nSo, now I'm here on Reddit sharing the things my fucked up brain likes to tell me instead of self destructing....\n\nHow's your night going?","396":"Tomorrow I'll officially be 5 months sober and as I reflect on my journey this year -- it's hard to believe. This time last year I had gotten off Suboxone and convinced my doctors to put me back on Oxycodone. From there, I decided to get off the oxycodone in early February and returned to recovery.\n\nI didn't take it seriously though and I started cheating. Then on July 29th in a moment of clarity -- I guess -- I confessed to my therapist that I had been using on and off Between February and July. I had no intention of quitting. As far as I was concerned I was just going to chip and use opiates \"for pain,\" and be fine. \n\n*'cuz everything is fiiinnnnneeeeee.* (meanwhile everything is on fire). \n\nAnyway, that didn't happen. \n\nI started doing things differently. I decided to take each and every suggestion that was made to me with the best of intentions. Not every suggestion was right for me, but eventually, I found a system that worked for me. \n\nI still haven't used since July 29th, 2020. I even had a hospitalization in the past 5 months for my pancreas and didn't use opiates whatsoever during that time. If you'd seen or know me from this subreddit 2 years ago, you know that this is all a dramatic change for me.\n\nI know today is Christmas, but tomorrow I get a huge gift. The gift of being five months sober and I just wanted to share my story a bit in hopes of uplifting someone else here.\n\nXo, Dori.","397":"Why is it that growing up it takes 100 good things to compensate for 1 bad thing.  Like even now there could be 1 negative comment on a post and 100 good ones and my brain will be absorbed with the 1 negative thing...\n\nHowever, when I think back to my addiction I fixate on all the good things and ignore the rest. It\u2019s like the bad shit doesn\u2019t even matter but reverse that anywhere else in my life and it takes 100 good things to undo 1 bad. Whereas with addiction 100 good experiences heavily outweigh any kind of negative experiences.  \n\nWhat. The. Fuck. Is. This. Sorcery!?","398":"Age: Early 30's\n\nMedications: Prozac, Abilify, &amp; Wellbutrin\n\nMedical Condition: Depression and Substance Abuse Disorder\n\nI've been off of narcotics for 129 days. I've been experiencing post acute withdrawal syndrome to the point that I feel like I'm in active withdrawals out of nowhere, body aches, sweating, restless legs, etc. I was wondering would a dose of clonidine help with this or any other medication I should ask my doctor about?\n\nThanks.","399":"I've been posting about my brother on r\/opiates at the end of November for 8 years. This year is not any different. I want to bring awareness opioid addiction and how I've coped with it over the years.\n\nYou see, 10 years ago today my brother was in the last 24hours of his life. He died in the late night on November 29th, 2010. The last time I saw him alive was at Thanksgiving. The holidays are a rough time for myself and my family.  \n\nToday, I am 122 days off drugs and doing much better, while I do miss my brother, I\u2019m happy and I\u2019m sharing my story, because I want to show others that, no matter how painful your situation is, you can and will get through it all. I honor my brother's memory by not using and working hard for my recovery. I overcame the hardest thing to ever happen to me. It\u2019s all about perseverance and taking it one step at a time. It sound cliche but it is true that every moment is precious. \n\nTime doesn\u2019t heal all wounds. It only allows you a chance to develop better coping mechanisms. Over the years my tools to handle the grief have improved dramatically despite the fact that my grief will always be incredibly painful.","400":"This past week I was hospitalized for pancreatitis. I don't know how I did it without opiates, but I did. After lengthy discussions with my sponsor, doctors, and family we all decided low dose ketamine and a solid amount of Benadryl to sedate me throughout the process was the way to go. It sorta worked. I cannot believe I did it without the opiates or without benzos because that shit was very anxiety inducing.\n\nThe problem is I'm in the aftermath of my hospitalization and beginning to process what I just went through. I keep playing the tape through and as a result my brain keeps trying to justify using. I'm even slightly annoyed with myself for not taking anything in the hospital because I keep telling myself, \"you would've been justified!\" I get the physical addiction, but holy shit the way opiates have hijacked my brain is incredible. Here I am with 110 days clean and all I want to do is use after fighting tooth and nail to NOT use.\n\nWHAT IS THIS SORCERY!?\n\nAlso if anyone has any tips on how to combat Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome - it would be greatly appreciated. I need more tools in my toolbox so far I've got \"call my sponsor,\" \"text 5-10 friends,\" \"do step work,\" \"read from the basic text,\" and \"try to meditate.\" Any other suggestions are warmly welcomed.","401":"I recently celebrated 90 days of clean time. Well, today my brain decided to fuck with me a whole bunch. My disease was talking to me: \n\n&gt;\"Imagine how good the painkillers would work right now! You wouldn't need a lot! AND YOU HAVE MONEY TO GET THEM!!!\"\n\nSo all day I've been telling that thought to come back later. Like a boomerang it kept circling back into my head. So INSTEAD of picking up I went ahead and texted a few people including my sponsor. Then, I started working on my step work when my sponsor texted back. We made a small plan for me to go for a walk, listen to music, come home, take a hot bath and have some ice cream after.\n\nOf course, I don't ever listen 100% so I got dressed went outside and instead of listening to music I called her. I also decided not to do a hot bath or ice cream. Instead I decided to walk to 7\/11 to get snacks. I ended up with Orange Juice, a PushPop, and Salt&amp;Vinegar Chips instead of dope.\n\nGot home safe and sound, and am seriously lowkey proud of me right now.","402":"Hi Reddit. For those that don't know me my name is Dori. I joined [r\/opiates](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/opiates\/) eight years ago. I am definitely an addict and have dealt with many struggles. Today I am cleaned up and we'll get there. For right now though this is about my cousin's and her memory.\n\nI'll never forget 5 years ago today. I was away from home, shooting my prescription opiates through my feeding tube and lounging on the couch because, that's what I did every single day. That morning I had posted to my cousins Facebook page with a picture of Kristen Stuart. Apparently some stupid Facebook quiz told me that I looked like her and because my cousin and I looked a lot alike I tagged her in that post.\n\nA few hours later, I'm on a skype call with my best friend. We've known each other since childhood. So, as we're chitchatting she asks, \"Who is \\[cousin\\]?\" &amp; I respond with \"Oh, that's \\[cousin\\] she's amazing! We reconnected recently.\" She asks if I'd been to her facebook page recently and I tell her I was there that morning when I posted the Kristen Stuart photo and as I'm telling my best friend this I pull up my cousin's page because I know something was up.\n\nI was not prepared for what I found.\n\nI found condolences, RIP posts, and \"is this a joke?!\" posts all over my cousin's Facebook. Immediately, I freak out, I hang up on my best friend to make calls as my brain is trying to process this information. I want to call my aunt ASAP. I decide against it. I call up my dad who is overseas. It's the middle of the night for him and I leave a horrific voicemail of me freaking out. I call my mom who lived a state away and she tells me it's true &amp; she's 3 hours away from me. She was driving out to me to tell me the news in person.\n\nThat comforted me a lot despite finding out on Facebook of all things. It also helped that I was live with my best friend, because she's seen some shit with me and is an amazing person.\n\nThere's more to that day, but in the days following I had found out my cousin relapsed on heroin. In the months following we found out that she had died from a fentanyl overdose. My cousin struggled with heroin for most of her life. She died in her late-20s.\n\nA few months before my cousin's death I was in my hometown and my cousin asked me if I wanted to support her and go to an NA meeting with her. I had declined. I thought it would be weird for me because I \"needed\" pain medication for my chronic pain. This is a decision I regret every single day.\n\nMy aunt had outlived her only two children. Her son had passed two years prior to a diabetes complication. Seeing her pain motivated me to clean up my life. Today, I walk the exact same rooms of narcotics anonymous that my cousin walked in my original hometown.\n\nI didn't get there right away though. It wasn't until three long years after my cousins death that I attended my first meeting. From there, I'd like to say the path to recovery was beautiful, but that's simply not the truth. I struggled and even after entering the rooms I had many setbacks, relapses, temper tantrums, &amp; caught many cases of the \"fuckits.\" before my most recent relapse 57 days ago.\n\nI'm coming up on 60 days clean and this time I'm hopeful it's going to stick, because for the first time ever the pain and misery of using has outweighed the temporary relief it gives me. Some recovering addicts in the rooms knew my cousin too. I've started to embrace that and now it has become a blessing for me because they have experience with someone who was genetically like me. They've guided me and help me immensely. I've been able to learn from my cousin and grow as a result.\n\nThat in my opinion is the best way to honor my cousin's memory.\n\nI share this story with you all today, because even though it's horrific and sad, there's hope to it and I just hope that someone here gets something out of this story. I don't post often anymore, but I still lurk around and if no one has said it to you today, active addiction or not, let me tell you that I love you just the way you are.","403":"Hey guys, I love you all. &amp; I'm thinking of deleting Dori. I've gotten a huge opportunity in my life right now and there's a few things at play:\n\n1. Regardless my social media is going on lockdown within the next year. I have a stalker that gets out of prison within the year after serving a 12-year sentence.\n2. I have an amazing opportunity to work with some big names in the entertainment industry on a human level. I found a place of healing. I'm extremely excited about it. I wish I could say more.\n3. I've outgrown narcotics. Those close to me know this. They know my struggles, and they see a difference. I can commitment myself to 5 years of sobriety starting 11 days ago.\n4. I'm taking a path to getting a potential book deal. I'm very hesitant about this. It'd be a book about the loss of my younger brother. I'm writing currently, but I've signed no contracts and want to see where it could go and if I even WANT to share.\n5. I'm finding myself less able to share things on here and just am not relating to many. It's rough. These forums have been a safe space for me.\n\nSo, ultimately, I know the Dori in me will never go away. I just don't know.","404":"Tonight I'm 4 days clean from oxycodone. It's not my first rodeo. I've done it a few times voluntarily since 2017. I'm hoping I took my last recreational dose Friday for good. Despite what I was prepared for the withdrawals weren't anywhere near difficult. A mix of Lyrica, Clonidine, &amp; Xanax + Tylenol, Ibuprofen, Imodium, and Anti-Nausea meds. Slept through most of Saturday and most of Sunday. I felt ill. However, come bed time on Sunday my only serious problem seemed to be my restless leg. \n\nRegardless I slept well enough to feel like a new person.\n\nTuesday, today, though, well that's where Miss Karma showed up. For those that know my story, part of the reason I stopped going to Narcotics Anonymous had to do with two failed sponsorships and increasing legitimate physical pain. I haven't been into an NA room since my 1 year this past October.\n\n&gt;I felt betrayed, angry, and simply defeated by the fact that my body was out of my control. The speech I gave on my October 14th, was designed to give a newcomer hope. It was made to fit the mold, tell everyone how WELL I was doing.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;All I wanted to really do though, was call bullshit. Call bullshit on my legitimacy, call bullshit about not being scared, call bullshit on my insecurities and ego. I wanted to let the room know I was never supposed to be there in the first place. So why was I?  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;I was the one who strictly went by, \"*best way to never get addicted is to never try*.\" I never sought Marijuana out, illegal drugs? WHAT THE FUCK was that!? I didn't even know my closest blood cousin, because who wants to associate with a heroin addict? Her disease haunted her from the time she was 16. She was 29 upon death. \n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;She walked these EXACT rooms. She's been in the same room years prior that I was standing in. What good did it do her? How many birthdays did she celebrate before it killed her? I had reconnected with her when she was in these rooms and I realize she was living the same unhappy lie I was living.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;Conforming to what every expects a *good* addict to do. Get your steps done, tell your sponsor EVERYTHING, be happy, be grateful, count your blessings, have quality problems, one day at a time.  you have to want it, think about the similarities not the differences. It works if you work it. \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;Then think about my brother. Who despite never hanging with my cousin died of an heroin dose of his own. An addiction we didn't know he had. It was a foreign to me. I went to a Dual Diagnosis Facility for DEPRESSION and suicidality almost a year after his death. Because if my brother can die, twisted enough, \"anything you can do I can do better,\" disturbing sibling rivalry   \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;The drug counselor was baffled my naivety, \"so a \\[blank city\\] girl?\" I told him it was the land of \\[what we're known for\\] looking back now he was trying to get me to talk drugs, \"youre brother died of heroin...how do you cope?\" my response, \"Well, I'm here aren't, I.\" looking back he was looking for me to say, \"drugs,\" I wouldn't know Heroin from Marijuana from prescription pills if he put them in front of me.  \n&gt;  \n&gt;\n&gt;So, how do I get here. How am I detoxing for the countless time in the last 3 years. Surely therapy helped? Would I have just stayed away?  kept saying no? The chilling answer is:  \n&gt;  \n&gt;**No.**  \n&gt;  \n&gt;I got ill. Chronically ill. An illness, an illness that impacts me for the rest of my life. An illness that has caused countless ER visits and hospitalizations. Not deadly, just a huge PHYSICALLY PAINFUL nuisance. Was that all that was going on though? No. I had a dead brother who died of virtually the same thing the hospital put into my veins, I struggled, and shamed myself for needing it and then...\n\n&gt;....well I gave up and gave in. \n\n\n\nSo, here we are 4 days clean and I'm at the supermarket at an ungodly hour on My Way To Work which is something I RARELY do. I wanted to get a thing of creamer for my keurig I got going here at my desk and figure the ladies in events will let me store the creamer in their mini fridge vs. the main one - I digress.\n\nI stop and grab a naked juice as well and go over to the only cashier there that's opened.\n\nI have two items this woman has about 5 iced tea drinks and few other random things. She says good morning out of nowhere &amp; I'm all like oh morning and she looks at me, at first I figure she's gonna let me go ahead since I have two items. Interestingly enough, it's Her. \\[first sponsor\\]'s sponsor. I never had any hard feelings to her. Ever. She's the first person I've seen outside of NA. \n\nSince I last went on October 14th.\n\nand out of no where she reaches in for a hug and we have this big hug in the middle of the check out. like a real hug. the kinda hug that means something. haven't seen her since I stopped going to NA. Even deleted her number out of my phone so I wouldn't accidentally text her or first sponsor or anything.\n\nI gave her the 3-5 minute rundown, that my physicians put me back on stuff, the extra trouble with my neck, the fact that I'm currently 4\/5 days off of everything as of today - how odd - miss karma at work -- and finally, the good stuff too, still engaged to be married soon, and just did the engagement pictures. I added her number back to my phone - just in case. \n\n&amp; that's where the story ends for now.","405":"I'm withdrawing from opiates. Both a 45mg per day max of oxycodone and a 5g of heroin. That lasted me an entire month.  \n\nYesterday I was in extreme pain from it and my legs wouldn't stop being restless. It was awful so I opted to knock myself out with lyrica and xanax. It was helpful. I slept the day away only waking up for  30minutes here and there. \n\nIt continued through the night and so I dosed with clonidine. That helped but was doing jack shit. So I started with the lope. I think I took rough 15mg (not all at once) of lope last night. This morning ... day 2 when i was expecting it to be the worst.... I feel 80\u066a better. \n\nWtf.  Any ideas as to what is going on? I mean I'll take it... I'm just curious.","406":"I'm having a hard time. Really struggling. I'm hating myself right now. I ran out of my H a week ago and now I BLEW through my prescription pills, AND to top it all off I sent $500 BTC to the wrong address and will never see it again. I was going to use that money to buy comfort meds but now that's out of the picture. I don't know I'm really hurting physically and mentally right now. I may need to feign the flu and take tomorrow off. However, I know they really need me tomorrow. \n\nI really don't know. I feel like a piece of shit.","407":"It's no secret, I'm back on Oxycodone. I've even ventured down the Heroin route because my tolerance is so fucked. I want to get up and thrive. It's not about my next high or not feeling sick, it's about living. I can't live when I'm dying from addiction. \n\nI have wrestled over that the last few years wanting to be clean and going back and forth. Especially with my pain problems. It's a hell of a battle. I guess for me it has gotten worse. I still hold out hope that it can get better. \n\nRight now I'm blessed with an incredible job. I'm getting married. I'm living with my fianc\u00e9. I have a life. A life that I built in my sobriety. A life that I am afraid I am going to destroy with my current relapse.\n\nI believe I'm a ticking time bomb. I need to suffer through it and just pull the band aid off. I seem to be hopeless at tapering and I'm finding myself thinking Heroin is an acceptable answer. ^(hint: Heroin is NEVER the answer)\n\nI want my doctor to prescribe me comfort meds and let me just withdraw over a weeks time and just tell work it is the flu. The problem is that would mean admitting to the truth. The truth about my addiction. \n\nWhen I DO have a chronic pain problem that will need to be medicated in the future. I NEVER want to be in a situation where if required I'm denied reasonable painkillers. I've been there a few times and it is immensely traumatic.\n\nOne thing that may work and that I'm considering is to source the comfort medications through illicit means and rip the band aid off myself and do it on my own. That would give me the freedom to continue getting painkillers from my doctor that I could store away for those times when I legitimately need them. \n\nThe good news in all of this is I have not been to the ER since November. While that may seem like a short amount of time, I've been averaging a monthly ER visit in the last few yeas with actual hospitalizations roughly 4-6 times a year. So, I'm proud of myself for that. \n\nAnyway, I just felt a need to get my thoughts out of my head. Thanks for listening.","408":"Despite being a drug addict for 7 years I was always able to avoid Heroin. Until now. It used to always be that oxycodone, opana, dilaudid - well anything but heroin could carry my addiction. Until now, I currently need 160mg of oxycodone to feel well. With a habit that big it is financially unsustainable. So, I've moved to heroin. I really just want off of it all. I keep telling myself I'll be able to taper the H. But that's probably horseshit. Fuck me. Fuck me. Fuck me.\n\nEdit #1: Thanks for the love. I'm starting to think I might be better off going through withdrawal and risking my job. After all, my health is most important at the end of the day.","409":"OK so, today was gonna be sweet. I was going to lounge around the house and then go out to dinner with my cousin, parents and fiance.  It was gonna be great. \n\nUntil I felt super constipated. SO, So much pain. No matter what I did, nothing happened. I was pissed off and remember my GI doctor gave me samples of a medication on Friday that I was supposed to take daily. I skipped it Saturday because I'm always weary about new medications and didn't want any problems at the bridal shop.\n\nTomorrow I have work. I don't need anything strange happening there. That'd not be good. So, I took it today. Sunday. Just to get a feel for how it worked. My idea of it was that it may make me need to use the restroom because the Relistor makes you do that. Relistor is for opioid induced constipation. OK fair enough.\n\nWithin 20 minutes I'm itchy and little bumps are showing up. I wait 5 minutes to see if I'm hallucinating or if something bizarre is happening. So, then I confirm it's  severe I take 50mg of Benadryl and dial 911. By this time I massive red welts all over my arms, chest, and legs. 911 has me on FUCKING HOLD and I start panicking. I text my fiance and mom that if I don't respond and let them know paramedics where there or whatever, to dial 911 as well. Meanwhile I finally got through and the dispatcher stayed on the phone with me.\n\nParamedics show up just as the Benadryl starts to take affect still though, they take one single look at it and say, \"you're coming with us.\" I blow out the candles, snag my phone throw on fuzzy boots and get loaded up into the ambulance. I don't even lock my apartment.\n\nThey insist on taking me to the nearest hospital. 'cuz well allergic reactions can be deadly and I looked pretty awful. Kinda wish I took a photo but I was thinking in the moment and that didn't involve selfies of my arms, legs, and chest area at all. Priorities, ya know? \n\nER kept me for about an hour after administering some oral medications and then sent me home with a script of steroids to be safe. So, now, here's the next problem. Although I've never tried meth I react to steroids as if I'm fucking on it. You can probably tell by how long this is getting and stuff that I'm amped up. \n\nNow, I just have to be really careful for the next week or so and avoid annoying people\/getting emotional and into fights because there's been massive breakdowns for me as a result of the steroids. Breakdowns to the point that I'm pretty sure some Chinese tourist has video of 16 year old me going full meltdown mode on Hollywood Blvd throwing a toddler style fit over concert tickets (I forgot who) and to the point where the homeless are yelling that they need to shut me up.\n\nI'll only use them if I ABSOLUTELY have to. This is one of those times. I need to be so careful now, and stay away from  the drama.","410":"The day seemed to go smoothly. I spent a few hours on campus, dropped off the final and skipped out on class. I remember being confronted by the teacher\u2019s assistant, \u201cWhy are you leaving early?\u201d  he barked at my friend and I as we attempted to leave the 300-student lecture hall. He protested to me, lecturing me that family, places to be, and things to do would always be there. That I should seize hold of my education and opportunity ahead of me.\n\nAt that moment I agreed with him, and to be honest, I was just being a terrible student. It was the end of the term, I was having a good day and I didn\u2019t feel like sitting through the professor\u2019s last lecture. It was optional and the class had been a complete bore.\n\nAs I grabbed the bus back into my building I was done with fall term officially. I smiled to myself as I walked home from the bus stop. I noticed my phone had a voicemail. Short and sweet it struck fear into my heart:\n\n\u201cHey Dori\\_88, it is Daddy. Call me\u2014we need to talk.\u201d\n\nI called him back right away. The phone rang once, and he answered. We talked, and he said that him and mom were coming right over, that there was something to discuss\u2014we needed to have a family meeting right a way. They were on their way to my apartment.\n\nIt was strange. Why would we need to meet? Now? What for? I flew into a mode of panic. The apartment was a mess. \u201cJust get the place cleaned\u2014think later.\u201d  I don\u2019t know why I felt this way. Perhaps it was something in my father's tone that gave him away or a sixth sense of sorts. I acted out of fear and took 20 minutes to get the kitchen, bedroom area, and living area fully organized and done. My parents should have been arriving at any minute.\n\nYet they weren\u2019t there. Five long minutes passed and I racked my brain, \u201cThis isn\u2019t good,\u201d I thought to myself, as I peeked out the front window to look for them pulling up. They weren\u2019t there, and I paced.\n\n\u201cWell, think!\u201d I remember telling myself harshly. I remember analyzing it. \u201cDad called me, not mom. He said Daddy. Something\u2019s wrong, his tone was off. My great grandmother, she\u2019s 93 perhaps something horrible has happened to her? But that\u2019s on Mom\u2019s side, why wouldn\u2019t mom call me about that?\u201d I wondered, \u201cWell, wait, the dog\u2019s been sick. We know we have to put him down soon. Maybe he needs to be put down. Maybe the vet called.\u201d\n\n\u201c\\[My Brother\\] is going to freak out. I wonder if he\u2019s coming with mom and dad. They should be in the car by now. It\u2019s been thirty minutes, they should\u2019ve been here by now. They don\u2019t live that far away. Maybe I should call the house and see if \\[My Brother\\] answers, they\u2019re probably in the car alone without him and he\u2019s at home and already knows.\u201d\n\nIt was at that moment I was paralyzed with fear. I went to dial the house number but could not. I did not want to confirm the next thought I had. \u201cWhat if \\[My Brother\\] doesn\u2019t answer? What if something\u2019s happened to him?\u201d\n\nAnd then it struck me, ten minutes before my parents arrived. Ten minutes before I knew anything had happened, I feared the worst. \u201cWhat if \\[Brother\\] got into trouble\u2014what if he\u2019s dead?\u201d And like a mantra I repeated over and over again, out loud, \u201cPlease let it be the dog. Please let it be the dog. Don\u2019t let it be \\[Brother\\], not \\[Brother\\].\u201d\n\nI saw my parents pull up through the window. Before I knew it they were at my door, and as I opened the door before they could even fully ring the bell because I was right on the other end, waiting, I saw my mother\u2019s face, a picture of distress, an expression that is the definition of pure anguish, and without words I reached out to hug her, knowing something was horribly amiss. But before I could dive in for that hug, dad touched my shoulder and simply said, \u201c\\[Brother's\\] dead.\u201d I crumpled to the ground in what was a collapse in tears of incomprehensible grief.\n\nThat was nine short, yet long years ago.  He died of a heroin overdose. I miss him every day.\n\n***Be safe fam. You ARE loved.***","411":"On Sunday, I had an MRI on my neck to check some things. Monday my head was killing me. Not only that I was having extreme pain down my left arm. While I knew it wasn't a heart attack, I still went to the ER because it was painful. So, very painful. \n\nAt the ER I found out I have two bulging discs in my neck right below my metal plate from spinal surgery in 2016. Well, needless to say the ER awful. More so than usual. Due to being on the Subutex they \"couldn't\" and wouldn't give me any narcotics to help.\n\nThe pain was agonizing. So, instead they gave me was nausea meds, benadyl, toradol. That did nothing for me. Then, they decided to give me an IV steroid. Seconds after they administrated it, my ass started to burn. I was so shocked, turned to the nurse, and was like, \"OH GOD MY BUTTHOLE IS ON FIRE!\"  It quickly migrated to my crotch so between my stomach, arm and asshole I was in more pain than I could handle. They ended up sedating with valium, more benadryl, and a haladol So, that I could sleep and hopefully wake up to less pain.\n\nIt was bad.\n\nAfter that experience, I went to my doctors the next day. This is the one that was offering the Fentanyl. The ER visited really spooked me. I never want to end up in a situation where treating my pain is impossible. It was so traumatizing. Never again.I ended up walking out of there with a plan of action and oxycodone. My personal plan is to use the oxycodone until they can do neck injections to help with my neck pain. After that, I plan to reevaluate. I ultimately do not want to be on it for more than 3 months.\n\nPain is such a difficult thing to handle. I wouldn't wish it on anyone. Anyway, that's the latest. I'm no longer clean.","412":"You all have known me for a good few years. Some of you have even watched as I grew up on this subreddit. You saw me at my worst in terms of pain and addiction and you've seen me at my best in supposed recovery.\u00a0\n\nThe truth of the matter is I sit day to day at a solid 6 painscore. Daily. I'm exhausted by it and run down from it. Yet, I still put on a smile of sorts. I still get up. I still go to work. I still live a fulfilling life. At the same time, I've also cut down on Narcotics Anonymous. I wasn't able to relate as much as I would've liked and kept getting dropped by sponsors.\u00a0\n\n\nI don't think the answer for me is that program and neither is a pill.\n\n\nI'm currently on Buprenorphine.\n\n\nToday, I went in for an appointment for a pain management doctor that specializes in spinal problems. My neck has been getting worse and worse over time. I've had 2 surgeries on it and my spinal team is located a state away so I've been wanting to get a local team anyway.\n\n\nAs I talked to this doctor and he did some simple physical test he quickly realized I had more pain going on than I was letting on. He asked about my medication. I explained how I've been doing an unorthodox thing of being on subutex and taking 15mg oxycodone for pain relief when I flare.\u00a0\n\n\nHe wasn't too surprised, but as I explained that the bupe is stable and safe, it doesn't help the pain at all. I only take enough to not be in withdrawals and regretted getting on it. That I'd rather be on nothing than the bupe.\n\n\nThis doctor recommended I try fentanyl patches. He had read a study recently where they were saying fentanyl patches could help a ton that they were proven to be the new standard for gut issues and with my coexisting spinal problems I was a good candidate for it.\u00a0\n\n\nNow, I've been on fent patches before. They worked great ...\u00a0 until I got greedy and wanted to be on oxymorphone so I dropped the fentanyl patches for that. I wonder if I had stayed with the patches how things would've turned out....\u00a0\n\n\nIDK. Here is a doctor in the middle of an opioid crisis willing to put that aside and treat me like a human and potentially get my pain under control. Or at least try too. He's also licensed for the bupe so he said if things weren't working he could always switch me back to where I am now.\n\n\nWhile I don't think this is the complete answer, I do feel strongly that I'd like to give it a go. I have a lot of hesitation about this though. Ugh. I have no idea where I'm going with this. Just trying to talk it through in my brain and possibly get feedback.","413":"When I made decision to get clean in November of 2017, all I wanted was to not be dope sick. I had run out of money and had no more drugs. I decided then and there I would tough it out. Since then have there been relapses? Yes. Am I clean to the standards of NA? Absolutely not. I still smoke weed for pain and in the last year I've been put on subutex. The important question is:\n\n**Am I happy? 100% Absolutely!**\n\nThe night that I decided to be clean was the first positive step of many. From there I moved out of my parents, got a job, got engaged, and have been living an amazing life. I've been just amazed at how awesome my life has been. Could it get any better? Any better at all?\n\n**Yes, yes it can. Today I got a $5 raise.**\n\nThe biggest thing I've learned in these last few years is that I am worth something. I cannot describe how depressed I've been. Between my physical problems, mental health, and addiction, I thought I was meant to just survive. Now, I am thriving. Who knew it was possible?","414":"Wow. I cannot believe it Here we are. It's my 1 year 'birthday,'  Coincidentally, I have the day off work because it's Sukkot, a Jewish Holiday, and I work for a religious-based company. I actually have today and Tuesday off. Same thing for next week too. Which, in my opinion, is awesome. \n\nSo, originally, I was planning on hitting up a meeting I like and taking a cake there, but in all honesty, I've had such a hard time with Narcotics Anonymous that I wasn't feeling it. \n\nToday, was pretty lackluster, but in a good way. Ya know? A buddy of mine promised not to use or relapse today or anytime because it would insult me to do that on my one year or near it in their opinion. I agree and that alone makes me feel really good. \n\nIn some ways, I feel like I've accomplished jackshit because I'm on Subutex, and sometimes do need narcotics because of my pain problems with my health and all. \n\nHowever, when you look at the reality of it, I moved out of my damned parent's house, I'm engaged! I've got a job, and my finances are getting better. To me being clean is more about the transformation of your life than the actual drug. I do see how cutting the drug out helped me transform my world too.\n\nI don't know I'm having a lot of random thoughts and just wanted to share. XOXO. Stay beautiful fam.","415":"I'd really like to know why. I don't get it. We are the outcasts of society. Many people think we're all junkie scum. That we deserve to die. People believe we are the cause of our addiction. People think we are thieves. People think we are liars. People think we belong in prison. \n\nYet, we feel this need to pass that same type of hate onto each other. Why?\n\nI've been a victim of bullying on this subreddit as well. People used to say nasty things to me and about me all the time. To this day I get downvoted no matter what by at least 1 person. \n\n... &amp; of course Spinderella is in the hot seat and she doesn't even have the ability to defend herself.

I've had two awful experiences with sponsors in this past year. I felt really hurt by it. Everyone is telling me to move on and find someone new, but I'm so freaked out about getting into another bad situation that it just isn't worth it for me.  \n\nIt's not like I didn't give NA a chance either. I kept with it for over a year, accepted relapses, and worked the program as best I could despite my horrible issues with sponsorship. \n\nWhat I've found\/learned for myself is that Narcotics Anonymous is a suggestion. It is not a MUST for sobriety. I think using Narcotics Anonymous in conjunction with things like medication, therapy, and positive activities is the key to getting clean. For me following a rigid all or nothing \/ fail or pass type of system does more harm than good.\n\nSo October 14th, 2019 marks my 1 year consecutive anniversary and November 23rd, 2017 marks the date I decided to change my life.

What about angry? \n\nI'm asking how are you and want your genuine answer. \n\nAs for me, I'm doing well. Down to 1.50mg of subutex. I see my suboxone doctor tomorrow. Gonna get 2mg pills to make the taper easier. I haven't been to the hospital since early july and its mid September now! I cannot believe it. That much time out of the hospital is unheard of.  I have been pretty exhausted. So I've been handling that as I best I can. I also have stopped attending narcotics Anonymous.

You were really fucked up!\" I was very confused and started rattling off my normal medications. Dad cuts me off and asked if I took too many opiates or was smoking weed. I told him I could guarantee I was clean and if he'd like I'd come by and do a urine test for him. \n\nIt was an empty treat and my dad backed off a little bit after that. \n\nWhat was really annoying is I was doing the opposite of being on anything, I was tapering my Subutex script.

If you were impacted by the Equifax Data Breach you can collect up to $125 for damages. You can check if your [eligible here](https:\/\/www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com\/eligibility-check) (requires your last name and last 6 social security number digits) &amp; you can file a claim by clicking the file claim button on [this page](https:\/\/www.equifaxbreachsettlement.com\/). My entire immediate family was affected. We all selected the pre-paid card option and will hopefully get a little extra money long after we've forgotten we even submitted this form. Which, is always nice IMHO.\n\n# Now things to note:\n\n1. This website is **LEGITIMATE** it is linked to from this [FTC GOVERNMENT SITE](https:\/\/www.ftc.gov\/enforcement\/cases-proceedings\/refunds\/equifax-data-breach-settlement).\n2. If you want you can claim up to 10 hours of work on this without any proof of it. That means you can get $375 instead of $125, *but that might be murky water*. I personally just signed up for the $125 option.\n3. If you select the $125 option - you also need to get credit monitoring for 6 months - ***essentially, what I'm saying is read the site carefully.***\n4. You may get less money depending on how many people join the class action suit\n5. There''s always a chance the class action is unsuccessful and everyone gets nothing. IANAL disclaimer, but I personally think that's unlikely.\n6. If you live outside of the USA and were NOT affected and cannot collect, *don't be sad*, just know your social security number and\/or **private details aren't compromised and that's a lot better.**\n\n# You are all very welcome.","427":"Whelp, between all my physical health struggles and ever since my feeding tube was removed - I've gained 70lbs in 2 years making me 70lbs overweight. It's disgusting. It's disturbing to me. \n\nI really don't think I eat a whole heck of a lot seeing as I'm nauseated most days. I eat in small increments, my stomach can't handle more. I've been throughly elevated and aside from a minor autoimmune disorder and my existing pancreatic condition there is no good reason for me to be gaining all this weight. Luckily I've plateaued  at my current weight and I fluctuate 8-10 pounds from morning to night. \n\nI know this isn't really opiate related, but you guys are my fam and I'm in need of serious help. I don't even know where to start diet wise. So, I've been thinking of ways I could try to get exercise. However when it takes a whole hour to burn 250 calories - that's pretty discouraging for me. \n\nAnyway, any encouragement, advice or spot to start would be amazing. I'm thinking of buying a swim cap\/googles and going swimming at my friend's condo. She lives a mile from me, I could walk there swim for 30-60 minutes and then walk back home. We've talked about doing this regularly after work. Then on days I'm not swimming I could potentially work on a couch to 5K program.\n\nAs for food, I'm just so lost. I can't eat a lot of fat or veggies because of my digestive system. Fruits work as does carbohydrates. The problem with that is that's a really high sugar diet. My GP prescribed me Adderall and said it might help. I haven't filled the script because it concerns me to take something else that I could potentially get addicted to.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHELP!","428":"I'm 9 months clean. And I get to spend it the hospital hooked up to the same drugs that turned me into an addict in the first place. Its concerning because I have no one to talk to about it seeing as my sponsor has ditched me. I do know its necessary to treat myself with kindness and take the opioids as directed by the hospital. Because without them the healing process would be a grueling one.  Since I've been here I've been on meds every 4hours for the lat 3days. Plus infusions of ketamine for 2 days. I need to trust myself md realize that I need to treat the pain properly because otherwise I wont heal and I'm a human being before I am an addict. I feel like due to my situation I work a Narcotics Anonymous program through the times of illness literature.","429":"I'm having trouble sleeping. Anyone else around to just chat with? Xo.
