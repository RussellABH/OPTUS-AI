Loperamide is an analog of meperidine (demerol).\n\nIt doesn't cross the blood brain barrier, (which is why its available without a script) however, another analog of meperidine is Lomotil (diphenoxyolate) which does cross the blood brain barrier.\n\nIt's combined with atropine to allegedly prevent abuse. However, the atropine is easily removed.\n\nBoth drugs will help with opiate withdrawal symptoms in high doses. Though lomotil is the better of the two.\n\nUsually the dosages for relief from some major withdrawal symptoms with loperimide are around 70 to 100 mgs.\n\nIf you're finding significant relief from from 24 mg of loperimide (12 tablets) you don't have much of an opiate habit, if you have one at all.  \n\n\n","1":"at bonnaroo. it smelled like flowers but I didn't get that high. might have been fake\/dogshit.","2":"Lol methadone....abiet old school??","3":"Immodium (loperamide) does in fact have activity on its own and it is a strong opiate, but sometimes potentiating it with something else is needed. Cimetidine is a common one, thought to interfere with the metabolism of loperamide enough to make it highly active in people who don't get any effect from it normally.\n\nI've used loperamide (with and without other things) in dosages as high as 220mg (oral) while heavily dependent, and it stops withdrawal easily. Yes, that's a shitton of pills. I ate 30-40 at a time by swallowing them quickly with water or a drink.\n\nEdit: I should add that at higher dosages, it lasts for well over a day. My original dose schedule was arranged so i took the loperamide every ~2 days and it stopped withdrawal for almost all of that time.","4":"Heard of this as well...","5":"You're getting placebo effect. Immodium is an opiate but it doesn't cross the blood brain barrier in high enough amounts to do anything. I've taken that combination before myself and felt nothing different.\n\nThe only thing I've read about getting high from Loperamide was a long chemist guide to converting it to another opiate but I can't remember what from memory.

When I went overseas I was really keen to check out the tar and my friends who use all wanted to know what it was like. After trying some and also getting hold of some of that brown powder, I really appreciated how lucky I am to live where I do. I'd intended to use for most of my holiday but after the initial experiences ended up leaving it alone. I can imagine that if you were used to the darker stuff and went somewhere where it was mostly white, you could easily end up getting yourself pretty messed up discipline and tolerance-wise. EDIT: It's also very expensive by comparison, hell nearly everything is more expensive here!\n","19":"I envy your access to high quality powder heroin. All we get in my area is black tar or shitty brown powder that's not worth the price. I guess it's probably good that I don't have the access to it though in the end.

Pretty sound advice in the thread so far, but I always like a smack discussion so I'll chime in all the same.\n\nNo, you won't get physically addicted the first time, nor if you truly keep it to 'once a year'. The thing with gear is basically that it's just too damn nice. If you get an overwhelming urge to use again after your first time (assuming you're not using other opiates) then it's mostly just because you liked it. In my case, I didn't feel much the first time but I seem to respond that way to most drugs. Expectation probably gets in the way or something. \n\nIt's smart to not want to go through your friends and keep it at a distance, but at the same time it's not smart to trust someone you don't know, trust gear you don't know the quality of or to use by yourself - especially at the beginning. I'd strongly suggest that if you know any trustworthy addicts or long term users (yes, they do exist) and you're determined to give it a go, do it under their supervision and make sure it's someone who keeps their shit together when they're stoned rather than someone who'll be nodding in the corner when you might need them.\n\nCan't help you with sourcing - I'm assuming you're in the US and I'm a long way from there.\n\nWhere I am, china white\/beige is the norm and black tar is extremely rare. I've always shot it. From the one time I had tar on holidays, I'd advise smoking it, but to each their own. People I know who snort the white seem to have a longer-lasting, less intense but equally satisfying experience so it seems like a good option for your first time but like I said I have no direct experience of that. If you're just curious as to what all the fuss is about, there really isn't any need to go down the IV path.\n\nDO NOT mix gear with pills and\/or alcohol or other shit. That's a big risk factor for not waking up.\n\nTo me, heroin is beautiful, but she can be a mean bitch too and I don't encourage anyone to mess with her. If you're gonna do it, better to be informed. Be careful man and if you're not sure, just leave it alone. All the best.\n\n","22":"I am no heavyweight, but 30mg of hydrocodone, a sunny day, a good friend, and a nice patch of grass has been a summer tradition for some time now.

","24":"If you cant find dope, just get oxycodone. Its the same strength as dope and has a more \"upper\" feel to it than the nod-fest that is heroin. I love both, but at least you know exactly what and how much youre getting if you get some oxycodone.","25":"Don't once you try it you'll never stop, and I'm not some person that just thinks they know everything I personally am hooked and now have to take suboxone every day just to feel normal.  Injecting is no more dangerous than any other way and trust me after the first time you wont be using it just once a year.","26":"Stop eating and start shooting. It's called economizing, you get three times the effect, and the shortened duration is hardly noticeable.","27":"I itch all the time, it's fine bro.","28":"Learn to crisp, the OPs become like, what would have been like OC70s.","29":"Suboxone is great. I don't need to go through the withdrawals and if I take it, I'm not gonna go drive all the way to score and risk arrest and all that shit.\n\nThe real bullshit is that while methadone and suboxone work differently, the idea of maintenance treatment is the same. Poor people go on methadone which is free, and they need to have it administered at a clinic daily. However, if you have money, you can get suboxone which you can take home, as long as you can afford the Dr. and the Rx. \n\nStill, I feel great on suboxone, it's like I'm my old self. I started at 26mg and after a year I'm down to 2mg a day. I still do opiates occasionally, though maybe once a month or so? Only when it's super convenient and I get my hands on them.\n\nBut this forum isn't about recovery, it's about people who are using. If you're clean, don't hang around here, it won't be good for your recovery. Good luck man, I know how hard what you did is, and I know how much it hurts. I hope to get there someday, congrats.","30":"1. No\n2. No, but GOOD LUCK NOT DOING IT AGAIN.\n\nYou need to tell us where you are so we know what kind of dope you get. If you happen to live in Jersey or NYC, you would get powder that I wouldn't suggest IVing on your first time (even though it's such a waste not to shoot it). If you live on the West Coast or Middle America, you might have tar, something I've never done and thus have no qualification to be talking about.\n\nThe point is, everyone who's addicted said the same thing you're saying at one point. \"I'm only gonna do it _____\". Good luck with that man, because it's REALLY HARD to not do it again once it becomes available. Plus it shoots your tolerance up so high that your Oxys won't do any good for you anymore.\n\nNo one plans to be an addict.\n\nListen man, I love heroin. It's the greatest thing in the world. But I regret trying it. Nobody is ever supposed to feel that good. I can't recommend it (since it wears off), but I love it all the same and know that no one will stop you. You gotta learn for yourself which it's so evil.","31":"[deleted]","32":"Please for the love of god, dont shoot it your first time. Just snort it, or smoke it if you get tar.","33":"1. No.\n2. No.\n3. You're best bet (and really you're only bet if you want to avoid open air drug markets) is by talking to people you know (who do other drugs or opiates) and asking them. You just have to pick who you ask wisely.\n4. IV is obviously going to be the best method. You do need to make sure you take all of the precautions. Using a new rig, filtering through cotton. You can easily find websites that will explain safe IV practices. \n\nNow for my last word of advice. As someone who is very familiar with opiates and are my drug of choice, please be careful. Everyone is different and possesses different willpower. The physical addiction is bad, but the psychological is also just as big of a deal. Even if I am currently not physically addicted and haven't been for some time, I still think about it daily and the desire is always there if you've ever used opiates daily for an extended length of time. Opiates are not bad in and of themselves. However, just like any other drug they have to be treated with respect and know your personal limits.","34":"25mg of oxymorphone, snorted in the passenger as my buddy drives around aimlessly, listening to Tool.","35":"I found it rather easy to just take the coating off and crush it with a spoon while it's wrapped up in a piece of computer paper.\n\nPaper is less static or whatever than most other surfaces, I find it's better than mirrors to be frank.

Unassisted, and assisted. Many people can kick opiates and go through the withdrawals without help. 2-4 weeks of suck, and they're off. Others need some sort of assistance. Popular methods include: Ibogaine, Methadone\/Buprenorphine, and in-patient cold turkey. Also, quickly becoming popular is detox under sedation.\n\nSuboxone is Buprenorphine (Temgesic) with Naloxone (narcan). It's a partial opioid agonist, it can produce analgesic effects. That's why it can make you feel \"good\" when you first take it. Naloxone's main purpose in Suboxone is to prevent relapse, as it prevents full agonists from reaching the receptors, and if taken while other opiates are present, will cause precipitated withdrawal. \n\nAll of this adds up to Methadone 2.0. Patients see their clinic weekly or monthly instead of daily, and stepping down is still the name of the game. There's still a toll to pay at the end of the road, but it's nothing compared to full blown, cold turkey, H detox. It's more like a mild to severe cold, with medical supervision and usually meds to lessen things like restless leg syndrome. \n\nReckitt Benckiser also offer to everyone prescribed a free by-phone support coach, who can be called upon at any time.\n\nIf you're thinking Methadone is the way to go, try Suboxone first. For a couple reasons: Weekly, not daily, clinic visits. It doesn't produce that weird 24\/7 high\/stupor. And going from Methadone to Suboxone is usually an awful experience.\n","144":"please pm me fb info, I might be stopping by later. Visiting CA from NYC and not loving the whole tar scene.

Still I'd love to spend a lazy Saturday just smoking some opium. It tastes like purple. ","195":"When it comes to narcotics doctors and pharmacists have heard every excuse there is. You might be able to get away with this because you've been a patient for 3 years if you have a spotless record as far as not filling scripts more than 72 hours early per each month supply, never have lost drugs in the past, etc. I've been filling a Xanax prescription 1-2 days early every month for the past year and this month insurance finally added up all the days. I filled on the 19th of last month and had to wait until the 23rd of this month. So basically they calculated that I had an extra 7 days supply (4 days between the 19th and 24th plus the 3 days early they let you fill). \n\nAs for when insurance started tracking it, they've always tracked it. They don't do it because they're trying to look at for your health; they do it because it makes fiscal sense for them to do so. Also depending on what state you live there could be regulations about it or a PDMP that would make it impossible to even go fill at anther pharmacy. Strangely though I filled three of my other prescriptions today (3 boxes of 75mcg\/hr Duragesic patches, 3 boxes of 25mcg\/hr Duragesic patches, and 150 8mg tablets of Hydromorphone) and I was able to fill earlier than I thought. The Duragesic I was filling was last filled on the 27th of last month so I didn't think I'd have a problem with that becuase of the 3 days insurance allows but the Hydromorphone was last filled on the 29th of last month because they had to order it for me last time around due to low stock and they're unable to dispense partials for CII medicactions. I didn't expect to be able to pick up the Hydromorphone today since it was 5 days early but for whatever reason it went through. Perhaps my doctor changed some wording in the instructions, like rather than 4-6 hours just 4 hours, but both said max 5 a day.\n\nAnyway the point is dealing with insurance is a pain in the ass but you can usually have a pretty good idea of when you can fill a prescription. Good luck. \n\nEDIT: I checked some online calculators for oral Morphine equivalency to Methadone and I got anywhere from 5mg-15mg of Methadone equaling 45mg of Morphine. Keep in mind, however, that MS Contin is a long acting medication and I'm not sure if Methadone is designed to deliver the dose all at once or has a time release mechanism as well (I would assume the latter though since it is commonly used for detox or maintenance). If it doesn't have a time release mechanism than just divide the amount of methadone you'd need by two and take that half dose 4-6 hours apart from one another since MS Contin is supposed to last for around 8-12 hours.

If one mg of sub= thirty mg oxy and also lasts longer it's easy to understand the motive to switch to such a cheaper alternative).

I also got a good line on some ms contin ir 30mg pills, so everything went better than expected.","280":"[deleted]","281":"I didn't hurl but it did make me feel awful along with high, and falsely brought me up when I was feeling low.

","283":"I am so glad I didn't let it get to that. They also try to scare you if you tell them you want to quit it. I was only on it for about 7 days and I was taking less and less each day. 3 8's a day is pretty crazy if you ask me. That is a tool to just get you hooked again.

So youre only using 25% of your oral dose. That gives you about 20mg of morphine, per day. Methadone is quite a bit stronger than morphine, so 10-15mg would probably be enough. Start with that, you can always add another 10-15mg if youre still feeling like shit.\n\nRemember, you can always take more, but never less.","289":"[deleted]","290":"Dude, call your pharmacy and tell them how your dog ate it.  Thank god she is ok!  the vet said she would be fine and her sleepiness would pass.  They'll work it out with insurance, or you may have to explain.  If it doesn't happen to often, you have no worries.","291":"Abdominal pain. Almost impossible to trace, but most GI docs are opposed to giving opiates. However, if you show up at the ER with upper right quadrant pain (possibly gallbladder) they should dose you up and give you some pills to go. - from someone w\/ actual UPQ pain, it's nerve based and untraceable. They'll want to do tests, but let them - inconclusive tests don't mean much, lady GI pain is a total mystery to medical science.","292":"Vendor also, pretty pretty please!","293":"[deleted]","294":"[deleted]","295":"[deleted]","296":"Unfortunately, most doctors dont really understand suboxone. They like to give big doses to people with big habits, like you would with methadone. Bupe doesnt work like that, its more like \"Less is more\". Bupe has a very high binding affinty to the mu opioid receptor. It so high that it knocks almost everything that can bind to a mu receptor off, including the naloxone included in the pill, and stays on there for quite some time. If you completely saturate your receptors, you leave no room for norbupe and your natural agonists to bind to. Thus, higher doses dont necessarily have a better therapeutic effect. \n\nI dislike subs because they are really just orange methadone. Another set of golden handcuffs, if you will. The withdrawal, while less severe, is significantly longer in duration. Having experienced both, I personally would take a heroin wd over a bupe wd any day. But they tell you that youll be able to wean off no problem.\n\nI dont agree with all your reasons to dislike it, but that is because its based off your own experience, not mine. I had a fine time using it, but hell in coming off. Im currently on subs (2nd time) for maintenance\/arthritis pain.","297":"suboxone made me hurl when my dr. gave it to me. ","298":"Thanks guys. That is 100% fair to say. I agree as well, so 3rd :)\n\nand I searched here and didn't find anyone posting this so I felt a sort of duty to do so. I could have also said this can be abused so if you can control opiates or don't care about your life these work not too bad at all. Especially 3 8mg at once (max prescribed does I think per day) like they prescribed me. Even one a day is not a bad deal if you want a slight buzz. \n\nSo actually pretty strong stuff. And this is why so dangerous IMHO: That upper side we always chase after our 1st experiences that will be only fleeting as you use and use. Suboxone delivers the opiated \"buzz\" and this to a pretty good degree. Again this is just according to me (someone who used pretty heavily for 14+ years) so I feel I have some point of view that is valid. \n\nSh!t sorry to ramble....","299":"agreed.","300":"I've never used it so I can't say if I agree or disagree, but I appreciate the viewpoint.","301":"[deleted]","302":"[deleted]","303":"[deleted]","304":"[deleted]","305":"[deleted]","306":"\\#6","307":"how much did you pay?

You may also look into Ultram (NMDA antagonist).","324":"Charts are a correct comparison of potency. They are not a direct comparison of bioavailabilty however. Unless it is, like the one to the right. It differs so much, from buprenorphine 10% and morphine 25%, to oxycodone at over 80%.  So, take them with a grain of salt, or look up the bioavailability for the route of administration you plan to use.\n\nMethadone is strong and lasts long. 1\/3 of your oral OC dose should do you fine. Remember, you can always take more, but you can never take less.","325":"I'm all for killing stigmas and having the final say in what I ingest, but claiming any opiate is harmless and \"less dangerous than caffeine\" is just ridiculous. \n\nSensationalist example (lol): Never heard of anyone's cars being broken into for pawn tokens, to score some Red Bull XD","326":"Agreed, with few exceptions, Im down with that perspective. ","327":"I think everyone has a preference. Some people like oxycodone. I suggest trying everything until you find the one that get you higher then the others.","328":"Damn, knew it was variable, didnt realize there was that much variability. ","329":"Those charts never really meant a lot to me. I get higher from snorting opana's then heroin, oxycontin, morphine, dilauded, hydrcodone, etc..\n","330":"Interesting, wonder how accurate those opiate conversion charts are then. Thanks for the link, Ill check out erowid's stuff on methadone. ","331":"From my experience methadone is far stronger then morphine. Also it takes much longer for a methadone buzz to wind down. As far as liquid vs. tablet, that's really just preference. Tablet if you snort pills, liquid will hit you just as fast. Check [this](http:\/\/www.erowid.org\/chemicals\/methadone\/methadone.shtml) out for all info concerning methadone.","332":"I gotcha, sounds more similar to hydrocodone than like you said, oc or ms. ","333":"It was more an extreme sense of content than euphoria MOST of the time. OC and the like seem better for that good ol \"feels good man\" stuff.\n","334":"Ah yea, that clonazepam would definitely get ya... thats sweet though, what was the euphoria like? comparable at all to oc or ms?","335":"Ya know at the same time I \"stumbled\" on a bottle of 2mg clonazepam that I abused the shit out of, so my memory is foggy. But I do remember it having a distinctly different \"clarity\" to it that other opiates\/opioids dont have. Was nice snorted. ","336":"Interesting, whats the sub high like?","337":"Yeah one time I stumbled on a bottle of 8mg little orange hexagons. That went down hill fast. Unique fun pharm though, i enjoyed.","338":"Yeah, all over south Spain and Portugal H was very easy to come by.  I would say easier in Portugal then Spain, but still relatively easy to get in either place.  I got the boat from Algeciras to Tangier and came back to Gibraltar, but I think there are other ports as well.  It is super cheap to stay in Morocco, as long as you don't mind rough accommodations.  ","339":"If it's been too long they won't refill it, especially for something like hydrocodone, and they'll think something's fishy as you are clearly not your father.","340":"I am not sure if all the pain meds will have to be reformulated, but some of them will.  You can get most of them with only 325 APAP, usually just made under a different name.\n\nHowever, like you, I recently switched to just oxycodone.  Was worried about liver damage down the line.","341":"If i remember modifinal is generic name for Provigal right?  I had some of those a couple years ago, didn't really sit well with me.  Also, I can actually say I have never really suffered any kind of withdrawal symptoms before.  Right now I take MS Contin 30mg every 12 hours, as well as 5mg Oxycodone 6x a day (i had doc take the tylenol out of it).  On a couple of occasions i have stopped them completely.  Had them stolen from me at work before, and the only problem i had was my back hurt alot more.","342":"True, hydrocodone is not as strong as oxycodone, but it is still an opiate painkiller.  So it is a medication that can easily cause addiction.  ","343":"also, is it easy to take the boat to tangier? is it just a ferry from gibraltar?","344":"thanks dude. like in andalusia?

Then wtf do u want us to do?\".    \nThanks to your advice from the previous post, I changed my mind about paying cash. Thanks\nGuess what. I will take them all at once and write a suicide letter saying you caused it. Enjoy being on fox news. \nnah just playin. lol\nYou sound like one of those who thinks he knows everything.

These are just a little stronger than our tylonol.\"  He stopped taking them halfway through the bottle. ","351":"Him not knowing people can get high off of pain killers is unlikely, either he doesn't care or maybe he didn't like the feeling he got from them (it happens, they make my mother sick\/upset stomach).  He could always figure he doesn't need it now, but the refill doesn't expire for likely a year.  Something could always come up.","352":"In your case, it is possible to apply for aid from the state.

Why you would refer to some fantasist movie when I'm telling you what you can expect to actually happen is beyond me.\n\nYou're actually thinking of paying cash for a script that has been filled on an insurance plan, yet, what I'm telling you sounds (to you) like an action movie.\n\nThe fact is you'll be on camera if you go to any chain pharmacy, and most private ones. The fact is your father will receive a print out of the prescriptions he filled that month, along with the actual cost, and his copay if any. \n\nYet, genius that you seem to think you are, you'll bypass all of that by paying cash.\n\nSadly, this is a grade d version of a bad movie with an idiot in the starring role.\n\nReread your pathetic excuse about your legs hurting as evidence of your idiocy.\n\nIf it's only about your legs hurting just go in and refill the prescription.

I'm really sorry about using your meds so I bought you the next refill.\"","356":"i might. The only thing i worry about is that letter. So i'll just wait for one of their vacations, refill the prescription. Throw away the insurance letter.

I don't know if anyone else had this problem, but my doctor had me try this once to replace percocet.  A day or so after I starting taking them i started to cough up blood, WTF.  I of course stopped taking them right away, and it stopped.  \n\nThis probably won't occur for everyone, but its def a side effect i wasn't aware of.","360":"Taking this kind of medication for prolonged periods is going to cause some damage, whether from addiction, or if you actually need them.  Addicts of course have a greater chance because its more likely they will take multiple pills at the same time.  The tylenol in the pills kills your liver over time, and too much of the opiate can slow your breathing to where it can cause a problem.","361":"Like others have said, if he doesn't need it and doesn't know he has a refil, i doubt he will notice you filled it, and if he ends up needing it in the future, he will go back to the doctor for a new script.\n\nHowever, i woudln't really condone this anyway.  Pain meds are controlled for a reason.  I myself take percocet and morphine for a back related issue, so i know how they can make you feel.  I can also say that coming off of this kind of medication can really suck, and is in no way worth the temporary \"high\" you get from them.\n\nI obviously can't tell you what to do, but i hope this helps you in some way.","362":"Most likely you'll be on camera once inside the pharmacy. If any problem should ever arise then there is photographic evidence that you picked up a legal refill.\n\nOther than that, I doubt your father would want to press charges against you. However, you should be aware that most insurance companies send the subscriber a monthly statement on what drugs were purchased that month, their total cost, his copay and other relevant information.\n\nThere is no way not to leave a trail.","363":"Also if he doesn't know he has a refill and then goes to the doctors to get a new prescription... either you or him will run into a problem getting the prescription filled.","364":"[deleted]","365":"damn. well i might just risk it and pay with insurance. Maybe i can intercept the letter","366":"[deleted]","367":"If you try to pay cash, I think the pharmacy will likely call either the prescribing doctor or your father to verify. Also, if you're going to pay cash, use a discount card such as http:\/\/www.rxcut.com to reduce the price. Also, with paying cash, theres a chance the pharmacy might remove his old insurance information and he would have to provide it the next time he goes for anything, this might set off a red flag to which he asks when it was removed and then you're busted.\n\nSounds like a bad idea overall.","368":"We get letters from our insurance everytime we go to a doctor stating the price and ect.\nWhat I'm wondering is will they send us something in the mail stating the medication price?  What if i don't go through the insurance and pay the full price?","369":"It depends on what his insurance is. Typically insurance companies will mail you something when an incident happens that requires doctors visits\/medication, so they can see if someone else is liable to pay the bill besides the insurance. What I'm referring to isn't an itemized list or anything but it might trigger a letter if one hasn't been sent already. Additionally, some insurances show your information online kind of like a bank statement log, if he was to check that for whatever reason he might see it listed.","370":".50 cents per mg when i'm hurtin and buying singles\n\nmuch much less when i take people","371":"This guide works.\n\nBetter off looking for pharms tho, Ive found in the 4 times I have gone the chiva is sub-par at best.","372":"Sometimes i would rather them be the middle man.

The only way I'd make an actual effort to buy Oxy as opposed to H is if I didn't have a single hook or reasonable spot to get H and had to go to the ghetto or something thus not knowing if I'd be buying rat poison or some crazy shit. If you're a heroin user\/addict, you should really have some sort of connection that you know won't have fucked up\/toxic adulterants in it (though obviously no one is going to be getting 100% pure heroin, but you should at least know you're not buying something with hazardous or deadly adulterants).\n\nWhat I find funny, is people with insurance usually (as in the vast majority of the time) have a minimal co-pay on their prescriptions (i.e they pay $20 - $40 out of pocket for the prescriptions and the insurance covers the rest... I pay $20 and $30 -$40 for certain name brand meds regardless of how many pills I get plus I have an Oxycontin coupon card my doc gave me). \n\nSo basically, what happens is some asshole will pick up their prescription for $20 and turn around and make $4000 or more (LITERALLY) in profit. Someone getting a high amount of meds per month (i.e 120 80s and NOT counting \"breakthrough\" meds) would make nearly $10,000 per month selling a full price meaning they could pull in nearly $120,000 TAX FUCING FREE dollars a year!!!!!!!. If I sold at full price $1.00+ per mg I'd make more than $4000 easily rofl (realistically around $5000, yes $5000 in my case considering some people won't pay $1.00 per mg)... AND over the past couple years I've accumulated some extra old formulation OCs (I occasionally have good pain days and don't take full daily amount when that happens) which I can apparently sell for a good amount MORE than $100 per pill... W T F, seriously what the fucking fuck of fuckity fucking fuck and fuck?\n\nPeople need to seriously just find some good\/reliable (yes, they do exist in more frequent amounts than some people think) heroin connections and increase the market demand which will in turn increase quality and even decrease price! For some reason, even Oxy \"abusers\" still perceive this unjustified stigma of Heroin. Some people say, \"oh, well Oxy perks me up some and I don't like the sedation of Herion\"... well guess what, in this thing called reality there really isn't an extreme difference in that regard EXCEPT when taking smaller amounts of substance... both substances can put you on a hardcore nod that's for fucking sure (there is also caffeine and other stimulants as well if you really honestly want\/need them)!\n\nAnyways, my advice is to find a decent Heroin connect, and stop giving douche bags with Oxy prescriptions fuck loads (and i mean SERIOUS FUCKING FUCK LOADS) of profit. Just think about it... If I ever decided to actually sell my prescription (which I am completely against in every way shape and form) I could personally pay all my rent and other living expenses from selling my monthly prescription and have plenty of spending money left over. That's not a good thing for society. I need to have a job as opposed to being some lazy ass douche nozel who exploits opiate users. \n\n**TL;DR** - Stop being idiots and find good Heroin connections and just use heroin. The more people who do this, the cheaper, more available, and higher quality heroin will become... AND douche bags with prescriptions who exploit users won't be able to live like kings. Oxy is overrated to the extreme. Stop fucking over legitimate pain patients by causing absurd regulations and stigma.","435":"i agree, paying for oxy has to be the most ignorant shit ever.

Pain killers are sensationalized by the media to such an insane extent that the stigma surrounding pain meds is beyond ridiculous. Additionally, doctors have to watch their asses hardcore, and the majority of doctors who don't specialize in pain management are scared as shit (with legitimate reason) to prescribe narcotics. If a patient gets caught selling their meds and the doctor didn't have a patient signed narcotic medicine contract with the patient (contracts typical in most states now, though not sure about Virginia) they can lose their license or have legal charges levied against them.

If you're interested in resin, they have good stuff but imo resin is extremely overrated and you should stick to regular kratom. If you go for extracts, their Full Spectrum 50x is INSANITY.

But being a former addict, or a former participant in a 12 Step program does not equate to expertise in the field of addiction and does not deliver the authority to condemn any method of recovery.  Nor does it provide any scientific understanding on the topic of addiction.  \n\nAll that aside, where did you get the impression that you were able, or had the right to, determine the best course of treatment for every single addict.  Though I am resolute in my agnosticism, NA works for me.  Infact, in my years of living in the hellish world of active addiction, I tried everything else to get me sober.  It was only when I began to put my entire focus into the program of NA that I was able to sober for more then a week.  By actively engaging in the steps I have finally been able to remain sober longer then I ever imagined possible.  That it worked for me does not convince me it is the only method, but when nothing else works its an amazing resource.\n\nWhile it works for me I would never claim that it will work for everyone, or that it is the only way to achieve sobriety.  Everyone has a very particular situation, personality, history, and belief system, that will require different methods of battling addiction.  That said, modern research into addiction and recovery is continually discovering more and more about the biology and pathology of addiction, which has been instrumental in understanding how addiction can be treated and avoided.  I find understanding the issues surrounding addiction and recovery to be very helpful in my recovery. To this end, I make a point of keeping up with the current research and findings of *legitimate* addiction-practitioners, who have had years of education and training that qualifies them as a specialist.\n\nThe content on the website linked above has no basis in the science of addiction.  It is based, instead, on fallacies presented by a person who does not even seem to understand the principles he is bashing.  For the most part, those principles agree with what any reputable specialist in addiction will tell you about recovery.  \n\nI wanted this to be an affable debate, but the tone of your comment precluded such civility. I am baffled as to what made you want to be so aggressive and bullying in your response.  Is this how you react whenever someone believes differently then you?  Perhaps your nasty tone derives from a bitterness about your experience with 12-Step programs.  As far as I could tell, the only purpose of your response was to attack me, as you certainly did not put effort into presenting any facts, or even a coherent argument.  At least you presented your hostile rant using with the flourish of good vocabulary, even if all it contributed was wordiness..\n\nUnfortunately, the over the top composition of your response does not make up for the complete absence of any content informed by even the most basic familiarity with the science of addiction.  What content I can detect amidst pointless and conceited wordiness, is informed by outdated rhetoric, personal opinion and a sprinkling of factoids.  Nothing you wrote indicates a a very deep knowledge on the topic, and it would appear as if you haven't kept up with any of the recent findings. There are many publications that present the latest research on addiction done by specialists whose careers are devoted to the topic.  These are going to be a lot more factual then websites with articles written by people who have no specialization, and no authority on the subject. \n\nThe level of training, education, and ongoing devotion to elucidating the nature of addiction, and how it can be treated, is a nice way to provide the context with which to evaluate that article and the website its on.  Instead of specialists you have unknown people, who are unlikely to have received any education or training, offering opinions and conclusions that are not informed by no more then a cursory understanding of the topic at best. What they lack in knowledge these writers seem happy to replace with unhelpful personal biases based on bitterness or aversions towards 12 Step programs.\n\nI am shocked to hear that you are engaged in the field of addiction. It boggles the mind that someone in this field would have such an antiquated understanding of the science of addiction, and would be so totally oblivious to the findings of real addiction specialists.

If you really need me to spell it out for you, 'eat away' refers to parts of your brain dying due to neuronal death, not some sort of physical eating away.\n\n&gt;There is a lot less actual neuron death going on from the usage of opiates than you seem to think.\n\nreferences or is this coming out of your ass?\n","549":"It's pretty clear you know absolutely nothing about addiction from an science and evidence based perspective, however, as evidenced by your boiler-plate, dogmatic non-answers, you appear to be a self-appointed expert on the 12 steps.\n\nMany of the people who write for the website thecleanslate.org are former members of AA and most of its equally ineffective hydra-headed offshoots, (CA, NA, OA, GA on and on ad infinitum) as well as health-care professionals (many who are former addicts) and well recognized clinicians and medical personnel who disagree with everything the 12 steps holds as their pernicious core theology and dogma.\n\nAddiction is addressed from an evidence based, scientifically sound perspective that can withstand the harsh, critical, dispassionate rigor of scientific scrutiny...something AA never has and never will.\n\nThere is no learned helplessness, powerlessness, disease, meetings in perpetuity, self-absorbed, self-appointed addiction experts, guru's, 12-step theologians, non-existent higher powers, program evangelists. There is nothing to recover from. There are no equally ill-informed sponsors required to pass on the harmful, useless dogma and holy writ of AA.\n\nThe 12-steps is an affront to reason, common sense, science, and above all else people with real diseases...the 12 steps is a disease of the mind.\n\nWithstanding dispassionate, scientific scrutiny is something the magical-thinking, purveyors of personal powerlessness can never hope to do...because the program knows nothing about addiction, let alone how to end it. Science is an anathema of all 12-step groups. \n\nWhile the program readily adopts pseudo-scientific terminology and invents false diagnosis (prescribing and religious indoctrination for a non-existent disease) they are nothing more than modern day charlatans, busy creating cures for an iatrogenic problem.\n\nWhat they excel at is a self-perpetuating, closed, fallacious feedback loop of harmful erroneous information in a pernicious cult that becomes the replacement drink or drug for the cult member.\n\nThe 12 steps *are the problem* masquerading as the solution.\n\nAA is an offshoot of the protestant Oxford Group founded by Rev. Frank Buchman.\n\nAA was invented whole-cloth out of the Oxford Group by two irresolute, religiously-afflicted, drunkards who were former members...Bill Wilson and his proctologist buddy, Dr. Bob.\n\nAnytime you care to discuss what you believe to be fallacies regarding addiction you know where to find me. \n\nYou know nothing about addiction...nothing!\n\nHowever, I'd wager you're a fully indoctrinated member, and self-appointed expert on the 12-steps. \n\nAs evidenced by the boiler-plate, fallacious ideas you have about addiction.

If the brain is being eaten away, wouldn't that mean it's size is changing, becoming smaller? In overly simple terms, when an object is eaten, does its size not change?\n\nIt's pretty apparent you don't really understand the science relevant to this thread (even though you claim to) or even basic elementary concepts of the universe that even most children comprehend fairly well. Get off your high horse and stop being such a douche bag. \n\nI think you should start by trying to grasp the concept that there is a big difference between the chronic frequent administration of a substance over long periods of time and minor to moderate usage. For example, the article (http:\/\/basicmed.med.ncku.edu.tw\/upload_data\/960608-2.pdf) you've linked, refers to the results of chronic usage, which is a much different thing than casual or even moderate usage. Golly gee whiz Mr... my advice is to try and think about the things you say before you make a fool of yourself again :) Have a fantastic day.\n\neidt: Also, and lastly, there is fundamental difference between a size change and halt of usage of neuron structures and actual neuron death. There is a lot less actual neuron death going on from the usage of opiates than you seem to think.","558":"[deleted]","559":"It is pretty clear that the person who wrote this has never been to NA or AA meetings, knows nothing about what it offers, how it functions, or what goes on within the variety of different meeting formats.  Also obvious, is the writers lack of any knowledge of current addiction research.  \n\n&lt; Kick things off with 90 days or more in rehab, so you can get used to being there.\n\nAs a matter of fact, study after study has found that the length of continual treatment in an inpatient rehab, or the like, has a direct relationship with both the length of the following period of sobriety, as well as the chances of lifelong sobriety.\n\n&lt; Think of all the things that will trigger you to use drugs again, and keep an eye out for them.\n\nThe whole concept of a 'trigger' is that automatic thoughts, and behavioral reactions occur when certain inputs occur.  These inputs, can vary widely in form, as well as source.  The key point being that the reaction occurs automatically, without the person being aware of the event.  A study in which they displayed of a series of images depicting obvious triggers ( needles, powder, baggies, rolled up bills) with each picture flashing so quickly the subject was unable to tell researchers what it was.  Even though the subject was not aware of what they saw, the part of the brain activated by these inputs still lit up.  This meant that before we even know what happened, our brain begins to send messages causing cravings and obsession over a substance.\nNow, if triggers can have this effect without you even being aware what is happening, they can be very dangerous.  The best way to protect against them is to determine ahead of time what events or inputs cause this reaction in your brain. Knowing this allows you to both make efforts to avoid them, as well as make it easier to recognize them when they occur.\n\n&gt; Make a plan on how to deal with your next slip or relapse.\n\nAddiction is an extremely difficult problem to treat, and recovery from it will often involve a relapse.  The severity and consequences of a relapse though depend on how a person responds once they occur.  Making a plan ahead of time makes it easier to halt the process as soon as possible, allowing the addict to return to sobriety.  Making this plan will not encourage one to relapse, it is just a safety mechanism in case of relapse.  As they say, 'Hope for the best, prepare for the worse'.\n\n\n&gt; Commiserate with others about how great drugs are and how much you miss getting high.\n\nOnce again numerous studies have concluded, and agreed, that one of the most beneficial ways to treat addiction is through open, honest, and safe communication with others who suffer from the same problem.  This communication allows participants to learn more about addiction as well as to hold each other accountable.\nAs whoever wrote this has clearly never attended an AA or NA meeting, or any group communication therapy, they have no idea what actually occurs in these meetings.  Sometimes discussion will bring up the topic of the upsides of early drug use, but this conversation will inevitably lead itself to the awful aspect of the life of an addict.  Euphoric recall is natural, and any trained moderator will be able to direct it in a beneficial direction.\n\n&gt; Build your entire social life around other people with substance use problems.\n\nBy creating a strong network of other people who are struggling with sobriety is essential for an addict's recovery.  Those who have decades can share their wisdom to those with a few days.  Two people with similar stories can realize they aren't alone.  Surrounding yourself with people in recovery also creates mutual accountability, instrumental in the early stages of recovery.\n\n&gt;Remind yourself that you can only stay sober for one day at a time.\n\nThis is just ignorance.  The idea of 'one day at a time' is that it is too difficult to say, I will never again use drugs or drink.  That cant be guaranteed and does nothing to help the mindset of sobriety.  Instead, the concept tells us to take our recovery one day at a time.  One tells themselves that that will not use today, an easy thing to accomplish.  The next day rolls around, once again, you will not use on that day.  And so on and so on.  People with decardes of uninterrupted sobriety will tell you that all those years were made up of one day at a time.\n\n\nI don't have time to explain the rest of the fallacies in this article, as there is nothing true or factual in it.  It is written by someone who has never experienced what he speaks of, and has either experienced addiction, or has never actually broken out of it.","560":"&gt; It's so funny how fucking pretentious drug users are sometimes, and how they tout how certain drugs (opiates) are harmless. No, they aren't harmless and if you're explaining it to a group of kids, you can justify saying it eats away at your brain. Because it does.\n\nYou're a flat out dolt haha. Opiates \"eat away\" at the brain eh? What a joke. There is a difference between the brain convincing itself it doesn't need to produce certain endorphins or perform certain chemical processes (thus having certain cells stop being used or produced) and the brain being literally eaten away.\n\nNow then... you've responded to my posts as if I was trying to make the point that opiates are completely harmless. I in no way attempted to make that point. Where do you get this shit from? I was talking about how I was told that brain size is reduced to the extent that it would be visible by the eye and I mentioned how substantial amounts of neuron death only occur in truly damaging amounts in long term consistent usage and you go and respond as if I'm wrong and that the brain actually does get eaten away and neuron death is so severe that any use of opiates will fuck you up severely. The fuck is wrong with you lol?\n\nI don't know if you're a troll, or if you're arguing just for the sake of arguing, or if you really are a dolt or what. Maybe you should read my posts more carefully... Is English your second language perhaps?\n\nAnyways, moderate usage of opiates (less than using like an addict does) won't cause any long term damage to any part of the body unless you factor in other substances mixed into opiates. Opiates are safely metabolized and excreted out of the body (obviously, if you take too much you can overdose but same goes for pretty much anything). You make it sound as if there were an opiate naive person who took an Oxycontin tablet, they would lose a huge amount of neurons and be profoundly fucked up forever in that their brain will be radically damaged to the point of insanity for the rest of their lives. Most OTC medications are more unhealthy than pure opiates are (though that doesn't mean they are completely harmless either --- had to mention this, because you're the type of person who would assume that I mean opiates are 100% harmless). \n\nMaybe you are just mad because people are downvoting you?","561":"the physical size of your brain??\nWhere did I say anything about the physical size of your brain. Read what I wrote. Saying neurons die doesn't implicate anything about the physical size of your brain. Using opiates on a regular or semi regular basis does indeed fuck up your brain in a clinically significant way. \n\nI don't think you understand how opiates work in your brain on a deeper level than, \" Umm, they release dopamine.\" It would behoove you to do some research, since it's really only yourself that you're affecting and I couldn't give a fuck either way. I know the science behind how it works. You sound like you've read a few forums or websites regarding opiate use but again, your knowledge is basic at best.","562":"You honestly think the physical size of your brain is going to shrink substantially in clinically significant amounts or that substantial neuron loss will occur from using a standard dose of opiates? And you think those articles you linked support your idea? You have just embarrassed yourself sir.\n\nIf a person is an addict and using substantial amounts on a consistent basis, your brain can undergo damaging changes that depending on your genetics may or may not be somewhat (but never fully) reversible. This includes things like fucking up the ability for the brain to produce necessary Endorphins for example. There is some neuron death involved in all this, but only in truly damaging amounts if heavy opiate usage occurs consistently over a long period of time. That's why some addicts need replacement therapy. Anyways, your literal overall brain size isn't going to fucking shrink in substantial amounts. It's not like your brain will be visibly smaller to the eye like I was told in DARE. We were told our brains could shrink almost in half. That's a ridiculous notion. Did you know that if a friend is horsing around with you and puts you in a choker hold briefly, neurons die? \n\nStop being ridiculous. Everyone knows that being a long term addict will have adverse effects, but to think that the physical size of your brain is truly going to SHRINK in significant amounts is fucking stupid.","563":"Here's a few articles to get you started. It's so funny how fucking pretentious drug users are sometimes, and how they tout how certain drugs (opiates) are harmless. No, they aren't harmless and if you're explaining it to a group of kids, you can justify saying it eats away at your brain. Because it does. That fuzzy feeling you get on opiates, that isn't without consequence. Every time you take opiates, neurons in your brain die. Dopamine pathways shrink. This is why it's hard for your body to elicit a natural response to pain in people who have been addicted to opiates. \n\nhttp:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC1114769\/\n\n- Opiates cause immunosuppresion by triggering apoptosis ( your cells killing themselves) in your lymphocytes\n\n\nhttp:\/\/www.springerlink.com\/content\/m46376n47l47428u\/\n\nhttp:\/\/basicmed.med.ncku.edu.tw\/upload_data\/960608-2.pdf\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2725184\/\n\n","564":"I wasn't talking about massive overdose... We were essentially told that taking opiates in any amounts would eat away at the brain and physically decrease its size (as in visibly if looked at with our eyes). If you get high on opiates, your neurons don't kill themselves (at least not in truly damaging amounts unless you consider this effects accumulation over many years in an addict using large amounts consistently)... if you overdose on opiates and you stop breathing and not enough oxygen gets to your brain, then obviously at that point your neurons will start start to die.\n\nedit: Everyone knows if you're an addict for a long time, you're going to damage yourself. If a person takes a few vicodin a few times a month, they will not accumulate any substantial or diagnostically relevant damage.","565":"well they do cause your neurons to stop firing then kill themselves in your brain.","566":"Depends on what type of pain it is. If you have a visible problem or problem that can be positively tested for (i.e with an x-ray or whatever) then you can exaggerate the pain. Conversely, if the pain is something the doctor will have to take your word on that it's actually real, you'll have a more difficult time. \n\nWhat you should do is fill the prescription for whatever the doc gives you, and call in or go back a around a couple weeks later and say the meds aren't working and that the pain\/injury\/medication side effects\/whatever is messing with your ability to function properly. Say it's interfering with your ability to work and or study and or do whatever it is you normally do. \n\nProblem is, asking for a narcotic triggers red flags so while it may suck for awhile, you may have to just deal with going back and forth to the doctor for a few months while pretending to take the prescribed meds and saying they don't work. A good thing to do is look up side effects or common issues with meds prescribed and relate the problems they cause to what you do in your actual life.\n\nAnyways, I'm just barely hitting the tip of the iceberg here. There is a fine art and science to manipulation, ESPECIALLY when it comes to people as smart as doctors.

See the difference? No diarrhea vs massive amounts of uncomfortable diarrhea. See the difference? \n\nYou're seriously fucking retarded to think that Kratom is AS addictive as heroin or dilaudid or whatever. You are seriously outrageously idiotic on such a ridiculous level there is probably nothing I can say or do to convince you of your incorrectness. \n\nAnyways, there are actually a decent amount of peer reviewed articles that indicate Kratom isn't as addictive as Morphine and that withdrawal symptoms are not as severe. There was even a test done with pure 7-hydroxymitragynine vs Morphine and the symptoms while similar to morphine were less severe with the 7-hydroxymitragynine. \n\nThis following is from the first article that came to mind, and I'm not going to spend a lot of time compiling a large list of articles for you, but here's a quote for your dumbass:\n\n&gt; \"7-Hydroxymitragynine-dependent mice, which were chronically treated with 7-Hydroxymitragynine, also showed fewer and less severe but diagnostically relevant withdrawal signs after naloxone injection (3mg\/kg, s.c.), compared with the group of morphine-dependent mice (Table 1).\"\n\nQuote is from:\n\nAntinociception, tolerance and withdrawal symptoms induced by 7-hydroxymitragynine, an alkaloid from the Thai medicinal herb Mitragyna speciosa  \n\nOriginal Research Article Life Sciences, Volume 78, Issue 1, 19 \n\nNovember 2005, Pages 2-7\n\n**Now, go fuck yourself asshole.**\n\nedit: Formatting ","604":"[deleted]","605":"Yes.

There isn't really any single strain that everyone says is their favorite, but the vast majority of people (based on internet reading and from the several people I know who use) agree that Indo and Thai are much more stimulating than Bali. Most people will say Thai and Indo give more energy and are more uppity than a variety of other strains. A lot of people like that uppity Thai feeling more than other strains though. \n\nAnyways, having said that, my point is that while people prefer different strains from each other, most people agree the strains like Indo and Thai are stimulants while other strains are more of downers.

Saying Kratom is as addictive as real Opiates **is like saying Energy Drinks are as addictive as Crack.**\n\nAnyone who has ever done Kratom and isn't a complete moron knows it's not as addictive as actual Opiates. \n\nJesus Christ man, you blew my mind.","609":"Long time lurker here. I've only posted once before, but I saw this comment this morning and thought I'd respond since this guy is spreading around information that could potentially screw with someone (i.e someone withdrawing from Opiates). \n\nI've only used Opiates mildly before, but I did use Kratom for 4 1\/2 years. It started with a few grams of whole leaf here and there and then I moved onto to extracts and what not. Eventually, because of price I was buying whole leaf in bulk 1kg or more at a time. There were days that I had used 70 grams (toss and wash baby), and my friends who also use Kratom thought I was a lunatic for using that much. \n\nAnyways... when I went through withdrawal after my habit was getting too expensive for me (no job), I used OTC pain-killers and I had a couple Xanax as well. If what I went through withdrawal wise is as mild as withdrawal from actual opiates, then I'm stupid and should have been doing actual opiates. The withdrawals weren't fun, but I was able to go about my days and function ok (went to work everyday of the withdrawal and was fine for the most part).\n\n**gkhgkb** - Are you seriously telling me that my addiction to Kratom was as severe as addiction to actual opiates? Really? Like... really really? If that's the case, opiates aren't very addictive and withdrawals aren't a big deal and I don't think that's true so I'm inclined to believe you're wrong and stupid.","610":"&gt; Kratom can be just as addictive as any opiate when used at the dosages required by a user with high opiate tolerance established\n\nNo one is going to be taking hundreds and hundreds of grams of Kratom a day. I'm sorry, it's just not going to happen. \n\nPeople with big, huge (as in absurdly huge as in multiple grams a day) Heroin habits can take a couple ounces of good quality Kratom leaf and alleviate their symptoms quite a bit. I've had a lot of experience with both Kratom and Opiates (Oxycodone, Hydromorphone, Morphine and several others) and I can tell you, that there is no way Kratom is as addictive as real opiates are. That's just plain stupid man. I've withdrawn from both Kratom and Opiates, and I can tell you that it's a reasonable estimate that someone would have to be taking literally hundreds and hundreds of grams of Kratom a day in order for it to be as addictive as real opiates... and that's just not going to happen. \n\nDon't get me wrong, Kratom withdrawal suck, but it's a complete and total joke compared to withdrawals from real opiates. ","611":"7-hydroxymitragynine while more potent than morphine, occurs in extremely small amounts in Kratom leaf (far less than 1%). Kratom is not and can not ever be as addictive as any opiate period and I can't believe you are stupid enough to have convinced yourself that it can be. I've known personally several people who have used Kratom for treating withdrawals, several people who have been in withdrawals from HUGE AMOUNTS (50+ grams a day) of Kratom, and I've also been involved in a University study in California (not yet published) where 55 volunteers have used Kratom everyday (in varying amounts) for 4 months now (study completes at 6 months). \n\nYou are absolutely, radically, almost unbelievably moronic for thinking Kratom is as addictive as opiates. It's just soooo absurdly stupid I don't even know how to respond to it. Kratom withdrawal symptoms themselves are similar to actual opiate withdrawal symptoms, the big difference is the intensity\/degree of those symptoms. In Kratom withdrawal, you can have body aches all over, but they will be mild and easily dealt with. In actual opiate withdrawal, body aches can be outrageously painful on a level Kratom withdrawal symptoms could never, ever match. Do you understand the difference? Is this too hard for you to comprehend or what, because I can write up a lengthy post if I really need to if you truly are too dense to comprehend that Kratom in not as addictive as an actual opiate. If someone were taking pure isolated 7-hydroxymitragynine that would be a different story, but for fucks sake man, Kratom as addictive as dilaudid or morphine? WTF. Seriously, WTF.

Like for example, myself. I love Indo's and they are honestly the most relaxing for me. Thai is really the only stimulating one in my book. I also get euphoria with every type of kratom as well. Maybe it is the vendor you purchase from or just you are an individual and what works for many, may not work for you. You have laid out a decent guideline but it is still tailored to your specific needs. I am glad someone is finally putting in work for Kratom though, it is low-balled by the harder drug using community and they don't know how it can save lives.","615":"~~1200mg~~ 1800mg-2400mg or so (which is ~~2~~ 3+ capsules of the supplement I use) of N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine would be fine if you're taking 4 grams of Acetaminophen in a day. 4 grams of Acetaminophen is eight 5\/500 (500mg*8 = 4000mg = 4g) Vicodins for example. If you're constantly taking a shit load of Lortabs etc and what not, make sure you're also drinking enough water and be aware if you ever start to feel sick or have signs of Jaundice.

Unless you're using radically ridiculous amounts like 75 grams a day, Kratom withdrawals can be almost or even totally unnoticeable if a few OTC meds like ibuprofen and tylenol are used.\n\nPods on the other hand are literally opiates so that's another issue, but don't be telling people Kratom is just as addictive as Dilaudid, Morphine, and Hydrocodone as that's completely absurd.

On the other hand, if you're going to be taking a bunch of Vicodins\/Percocets\/Whatever all at once, go ahead and take the supplement 15 mins beforehand. \n\nAgain though, keep in mind N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine isn't a cure all for acetaminophen toxicity. While it protects you from toxicity quite a bit, it doesn't mean you can gulp down 15 Vicodins or something at once and think nothing of it.\n\nIf you Google N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine you'll of course find lots of info about it if you want further reading :) Perhaps start with the wiki page http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Acetylcysteine if you want.

If you go into a doctor and say \"I have such and such pain in my such and such and percocet will work\", most docs will immediately think you're a drug seeker.

Look what RX opiates have done to this country. I don't think I'd support anything other than the legalization of weed. Maybe if I saw some convincing studies that showed that the whole world wouldn't go to shit I would support it, but as is, I don't think it's a great idea to legalize highly addictive drugs. ","725":"**SUBUTEX:** Contains only Buprenorphine, which is a very strong opiate agonist. There are two cases with **SUBUTEX**:\n\n1. You take it when you are in Withdrawals, and it binds to the opiate receptors (not all of them), and it makes you fell Normal. If you are opiate naive, it will make you feel high, often too much to handle.\n\n2. If you take it before you get into WDs, it will kick out any other Opiate present from your brain and you will get a mild discomfort, followed by a relief after some time. Do not try to re-dose, it will worsen the effect. Try to be patient and enter WDs fully before dosing, okay?\n\n\n**SUBOXONE:** Contains Buprenorphine AND Naloxone (in small dosage). Naloxone is an Opiate antagonist, and it will kick out the Opiates present more harshly, not allowing any other opiate to bind into all opiate receptors. Something like a shield. \n\n1. If you take **SUBOXONE** when you are in full Withdrawals, things will get better like Scenario No1 with Subutex.\n\n1. If you take **SUBOXONE** before you are into full WDs, prepare for a **Nightmare**: It will create a condition called \"Precipitated Withdrawals\", because it will kick out the present opiates and it will send you in a very intense and sudden Withdrawal experience, worse than kicking the opiate Cold Turkey.\n\n**Street Rumor \/ Personal Experience:** So take it with a grain of sea salt.\n\nNaloxone \/ Naltrexone may be a substance that blocks the subject to feel the effects of e.g. Heroin, however, it also does not allow the Brain to recover and feel the effects of the natural opiates (endorphins\/enkefalins, etc) because it blocks them also...\n\nThere are some programs that after the person has detoxified, they take daily a dosage of Naltrexone, so that if they 'slip' and take opiates, they will not have any effect on their consciousness. However, a lot of subjects report that they never get over the Post Acute Withdrawal Symptoms, because the Naltr. doesn't allow the natural opiates of the brain to have an effect on it.\n\nI would recommend Subutex to kick the habit, and after that, explore personal ways to stay away from opiates (which is the hardest part). Unless you just want to take a break, lower your tolerance and start over. This scenario needs guts and strict schedule.\n\nGood luck. And remember: Do not feel any guilt about this situation. It will just make things worse. Opiate habits are like Homosexuality in the 1700s. A risky lifestyle that if the substance was legal and clear\/clean, people would just be on opiates forever just like a diabetic shoots insulin every day.\n\nResearch Opiates: They are not as harmful as they sound (exception: ODs, which often are a result of a mix with other Depressants) and a possible legalization would result into a betterment of many people's lives that need extra opiates to feel normal. Not high.\n\nTL;DR: Mythbustering opiates is something that our generation should do ASAP. Legalizing everything would be the best solution.","726":"I don't think there is a minimum amount you have to be using, just as long as you're addicted you can probably get a script.

However, you want to throw me some tar, go right ahead. \n\nThe information you asked for however:\n\n1) How to tell if it's real- Opium does not smell like incense. It smells like opium. Also, take your index finger and thumb and pull off a tiny piece off the larger ball. Real opium crumbles off into a smaller piece that can be rolled up and smoked. Fake opium that isn't even trying to look real will pull apart in gooey strings and leave a residue on your fingers. Think the difference between trying to crumble off a piece of Play-doh in comparison to trying to separate a piece of salt water taffy (sorry, that was the best example I could come up with).\n\n2) Price- A normal gram of \"opium\" found on the street should run you about $20 a gram. However, I have seen it sold for $30-$50 to the right people. However, REAL, strong, pure (or semi-pure) opium....is damn near priceless around my area (New York). I'm not sure why really, a heavy opiate user isn't really going to enjoy smoking opium enough to warrant such a high price. I think that sellers get away with that high of a price simply because it's somewhat of a novelty. \n\n3) Methods of Consumption- Opium is smoked most effectively through some kind of vaporizer. A light bulb vape has always worked better for me than any kind of bowl (short of a real opium pipe which I have never tried). The trick is to not actually light the opium on fire, place the flame a fraction of a centimeter away and inhale. You can also \"Chase the Dragon\" as o_g mentioned on tin foil. Simply place the ball of opium on the foil, place the lighter under the opium and inhale the smoke through a straw. Rotate the foil to catch the liquidated opium and follow the stream of smoke with your straw. \n\n4) Dosage- I can't really help you there. Smoke a small ball about the size of the cotton on the end of a q-tip (adjust size depending on the quality) at a time. Stop when you are high enough. ha\n\nI hope that was some of the information you were looking for. Good luck finding the real thing.\n","788":"[deleted]","789":"Yeah I hate withdrawing.

If you have any ideas to help me sleep that would be great! the problem is that because I hid my addiction from almost everyone I cant go to the doctor, family, etc for help... so it would have to be over the counter. Stopping at the moment is messing up my work, but I have to think that Sober &gt;&gt; functional addiction. I know my personality was changing for the worse and thats my main impetus to quit right now. \n\nI think just typing this and being able to confess has helped me, so thanks :)","832":"I straight up told my doctor about the insomnia associated with attempting much what you're doing.

I am 1 week clean today. I did 1 week of taper and planned to do another continuing to half the dose but decided to quit altogether instead.\n\nI have done the increasing spaced dosage that you described before, and it worked, but I was very much less of an addict then (so since I'm quitting now, you could say it didnt work...), personally just keep to the taper or cease, and dont dose until you are at least 2 weeks sober!\n\nit seems you have everything planned out so good luck to you, personally I can handle all of the withdrawls except the INSOMNIA. It is truly killer, and unfortunatly may last for months, and depending on how much you were doing before you may never recover your normal sleep pattern :( \n\nif you can go 4-5 days clean you should be able to stay that way, addiction is like a slowly brewing storm, when you stop using you reap the whirlwind.

If you HAVE to take more than 3 of them, then look up cold water extractions and do that. It will take out the acetaminophen so you can take more codeine.\n\nHowever, I don't think you need 5 of these. I take 60mg of oxy at a time, 3 times a day. When I am detoxing, I take 60-90 mg of codeine, and it certainly helps with the withdrawals.

The problem with this is that veins are fragile and even small partials can do damage to your veins and with regular use can cause the collapsed veins and infections. With a proper micron filter eg a 0.2um filter will remove any partials and can even filter out bacteria (note that it will not remove viruses). Using a filter will leave you with a sterile solution to shoot that will be completely clear. If use in occurring regularly or is going to be sustained over any significant period of time I would suggest in investing some filters like the ones I linked.","906":"Thanks for the link.

So I think it's Paracetemol for you guys) because Hydrocodone (active opiate in Vicodin) is soluble in cold water, where the Acetaminophen is not.  I don't think it works the same way with Ibuprofen, although I know that CWE's can be done on Codeine.  Google Nurofen CWE's and make sure it's specifically for that, otherwise you'll waste the pills.\n\nAlso take some Benadryl (Not sure if it's a different name in the EU, but it's an antihistamine, for allergies. So take anything that says Antihistamine) A half hour before you take the Codeine, because Codeine makes people itch pretty damn bad, and the antihistamine stops that and is also a potentiator for opiate effects, so will make you feel it stronger.

With such a high crop density the fast plants hog all the sun and get big while the slower plants are stunted due to lack of light, but rather than thinning them as the pros do I just harvested the biggest ones which lets light down to the lower canopy of seedlings, and this kind of makes a months-long perpetual harvest.

Now imagine that as they mature and you can continually harvest the bigger ones, that you have a steady stream of free opiates for the entire growing season.","1001":"The phoenix album by the warlocks, awesome psychedelic rock, plus two of the songs are about dope","1002":"Do you have any connects for cannabis, mushrooms, etc?

I think it has to do with either a deadening of nerves near your cochlea (inner ear), giving you a warming feeling, as well as a sensation like you can breathe through your ears. Notice also on Hydrocodone and Oxycodone that these are wonderful in drying your sinuses out (and have a bad effect of also drying your organs too), so this contributes to the sensation because the mucus in your ears drains out and is not replenished.\n\nIt's no wonder that Rush Limbaugh had hearing loss after taking too many back pain pills -- it was deadening cochlea nerves to the point of them not coming back.
