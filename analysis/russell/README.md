Here is a mess of different files for stuff that I worked on. 

* `/googleGPU`
    * This is the code that I ran on a cloud gpu to generate topic modeling on every row of our drugs-forum data
* `BERTopicTestArticles.ipynb`
    * I used to understand BERTopic topic modeling
* `BERTopicReddit.ipynb`
    * I used to test topic modeling on our Reddit data
* `spacytextblob.ipynb`
    * I used to test out sentiment analysis
* `compare_sentiment_models.ipynb`
    * I used to compare different sentiment models. I discovered that they're all the same.
* `preproccessForumData.ipynb`
    * I used to turn our scraped forum data into a useful format before uploading to the Box
