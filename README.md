# OPTUS-AI
Our goal is to raise awareness on the opioid crisis through creating a one-stop web application that tracks and displays social media discourse using novel Natural Language Processing techniques. 

### FastAPI Backend
Optus-AI runs FastAPI on the backend. To run the server locally, use the command:

```commandline
uvicorn backend.server:app --reload
```

Make sure to run this command in the ./OPTUS-AI directory.
Additionally, have the .env file under the ./OPTUS-AI folder
