        "post_content": "LIQUID TAPER METHOD\n\nThe following are detailed instructions on how to perform a liquid taper. This method is best suited for people that want to taper very slowly. Also, you do not have to deal with the precision cutting of film or using tablets to estimate dosages. This method works well with film but can also be employed using tablets. The ratio of dose verses fluid volume will vary depending on what strength medication you are starting with and what amount of liquid you use. It\u2019s all straightforward, basic math. This article lays out the most commonly used concentration.\n\nTools:\n\n\nBach\u2019s Rescue Remedy - Dark Bottle 10 ml (thoroughly cleaned and dried).\n1 ml/1 cc syringes, package of 6 (no needle)\nVodka, or any high proof, clear food quality liquor will work (make sure it doesn\u2019t have sugar in it). I found the strips will dissolve more quickly and thoroughly using alcohol but you can use filtered water. If using water it will need to be refrigerated, an alcohol solution does not. I found the strips just didn\u2019t dissolve as well in water. If you have reasons that you\u2019d prefer not to use alcohol, others have reported using mouthwash (with alcohol) worked great and was very tolerable and pleasant.\nCotton Balls\nScissors\nTweezers\nMagnifying glass, or a magnification App on your phone works great (quickly hit iPhone home button 3 times and it becomes a magnifying glass) or a Jewelers Loupe (this is what I used). The small .01 mg incremental lines are very difficult to see, especially if you suffer from eyestrain.\nMixing Solution:\n\nDry your hands thoroughly. Get a plate and cut your 8 mg film into 8 equal strips (avoid letting them touch each other as they might stick). If you\u2019re using 2 mg strips, get 4 and cut them in 1 mg pieces until you have 8. They\u2019ll fit into the bottle easier if they\u2019re small.\n\nGet your bottle and squirt 4 full syringes of 1 ml each of alcohol into it.\n\nDrop your strips into the bottle one at a time. If they stick at the top use a toothpick or something to stuff them in the bottle.\n\nAgain, squirt 4 more full syringes of 1 ml each of alcohol into the bottle.\n\nNow you\u2019ve got 8 mg\u2019s of sub in 8 ml\u2019s of solution.\n\nSo, 1 mg of sub = 1 ml of solution and 1/10 ml = .01 mg of sub.\n\nShake well until they are all dissolved. Also shake your bottle every time prior to dosing.\n\nPut one 1 syringe aside and only use it for the purpose of filling the bottle with liquid. As you use another syringe for dosing, over time the 1 ml line at the top will disappear due to handling it so many times so you'll need to use a new one from time to time.\n\nRinse the syringe after each dose. The syringes will become a bit sticky after a while. That\u2019s why you need more syringes so that the syringe moves smoothly as you pull up your dose.\n\nHow to Begin:\n\nStart with the liquid method only after you\u2019ve stabilized on 1 mg a day of physical film. It\u2019s easy to cut and chop the film until you get to around 1 mg. Also, above 1 mg there\u2019s just too much liquid. With a larger volume of liquid it\u2019s likely you can lose some to swallowing. You can dose twice per day, for example, .5 mg AM & .5 mg PM = 1 mg total or once a day. Most people do better with a two times a day schedule and it\u2019s less liquid, especially in the early stages of the taper.\n\nMake sure that you\u2019re stabilized and switch to the liquid method on the same dose you were on before. Do not try to switch and drop your dose simultaneously. This creates too many variables at once. You need to see how the switch to liquid affects you at first. It could feel stronger or weaker. You need to find out for yourself and adjust accordingly.\n\nAt first, the liquid may seem weaker than the physical film. Take time to adjust before dropping in dose, weeks if needed.\n\nTechnique:\n\nDraw up some liquid and then squirt it back into the bottle. This will get out any air bubbles. Place the syringe back into the bottle and draw up the amount of milligrams or micrograms that you need to take. Use your scissors to cut a small piece of cotton, and then stretch it out thinly so it\u2019s porous and the liquid remains in the fibers. Use the tweezers to place the cotton under your tongue. Slowly squirt the liquid into the cotton.\n\nHold the dose for as long as you usually do. Spit the cotton into a plastic baggy to be safely disposed of. If you have small children or pets you don\u2019t want the cotton to fall on the floor and jeopardize them.\n\nI strongly recommend keeping a daily journal of your dosages. You have to know how much you\u2019re taking and for how many days. This keeps you in control of your taper, and it\u2019s easy to lose track of.\n\nA good rule of thumb is to drop 10% every 10 to 14 days. Adjust as you see fit. You have to be flexible while tapering. If 14 days doesn\u2019t do it, hold for more days or as needed.\n\nListen to your body. It will tell you what to do.",

I was on methadone long time ago and I honestly thought more than on one occasion of going back on just to get off this last bit of subs.\n\nI got off methadone very easily tapering slow. Got down to last 1mg and never went back. Never experienced any withdrawal and I was on clinic for 2 years with dose being as high as 85.\n\nFunny you mention good insurance cause I have amazing insurance but the clinics here in Ma only take Ma health, they don\u2019t accept private insurances like tufts, bcbs etc. so that means 150 a week and they treat you like a pos and nothing against groups and meetings but I haven\u2019t touched my drug of choice in 15 years. I don\u2019t drink or do any drugs anymore. Quit cigarettes everything. I have to many health issues to even go there. I know I could get sucked in but it would have to be something very drastic, cause my health is what my main concern is now not getting high. \n\nI work a full time job and last time I called to inquire the lady had such a bad attitude and said why don\u2019t you just stay on suboxone otherwise your going to have to come everyday and do groups and individual counseling etc. at least at clinic they do the dosing, me on suboxone feel like I\u2019m\nGonna dose myself forever. \n\nIt sucks cause sometimes I feel I need to do something else to get off this shit. It\u2019s like the buprenorphine no matter how small the dose will eventually hold you like your doing a higher dose as far as getting off, if that makes sense",

I decreased my dose about 25% every 4-7 days. Some decreases were easier than others. It really wasn't bad. It was drawn out and I was ready so mentally I was good. It was great. Within a month of being clean off sub, I started doing heroin again. This time bad, really bad, daily habit for the last 3 years. Nearly destroyed my soul. Anyway 10 months ago I kicked but back on sub. I'm not ready to quit bupe just yet as I've been bouncing back and forth again. Idiot. I know. Anyway this great and I will save this great info for the future. Much appreciated. And yes, less IS more with sub. I want to bang my head against the wall when I hear anything more than 4 mgs.

Her story is in a different forum but here is the first liquid taper that lead to the one above. Thank you Sindysun...\n\nLiquid Taper...\n\nUse either pills or films. Equal amounts of liquid (vodka is what I use but may use a mixture of water and alcohol too). If you use only water make sure you refrigerate in between doses. Don't use alcohol with sugar in it because it starts to harden at the top and it's annoying.\nStrips or pills work. I prefer strips.\n\nObtain a small bottle like the one for rescue remedy. Google it if you don't know what it is. You can order it or get from pharmacies or vitamin/supplement stories.\nAlso obtain a 1ml/cc syringe such as a U-100 or U-50 insulin syringe or get a neonatal/infant syringe for administrating very low doses of oral meds.\nIf using an insulin syringe remove needle. Grab it at the bottom with plyers or scissors and pull out or just break it off at the bottom. Discard in a closed container so no one gets stuck.\nPut 1ml fluid per each 1mg of sub in the bottle shake and allow to dissolve (8mg sub to 8ml vodka). Use the syringe to draw up one ml at a time so your measurements are precise.\nThe measurements for liquid are equivalent to the dose of sub you are taking so if you are taking .2mg of sub then you would draw up to the 20 or 2 line depending on your syringe. If you're taking .72mg then go to first little line After 70. Each small line represents .02mg of sub now. The full syringe with a 100ml syringe is 1mg.\n\nShake bottle each time you draw up dose especially with pills bc some settles on the bottom.",

The biggest difference aside from administration in the cheek instead of under the tongue, is that it\u2019s prescribed in micrograms, with the highest dose being 900 mcg and the lowest 75 mcg, to be taken twice daily.\n\nThis is a lot different than the doses prescribed for addiction, which typically top out at 32 mg per day, but are more commonly 16 mg per day. \n\nHowever when tapering down, having easy access to those lower doses via Belbuca would be a great benefit to people. I think the lowest suboxone dose formulation is 2 mg strips. I don\u2019t know if they make a 2 mg tablet. They really should make it easier to taper by providing these lower doses to addiction patients, so they don\u2019t have to make special home concoctions.
