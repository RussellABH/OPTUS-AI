        <p>Our goal is to raise awareness on the opioid crisis through creating a one-stop web application that tracks and displays social media discourse using novel Natural Language Processing techniques. When a user goes on the website, they are greeted with a dashboard of multiple different interactive visualizations. For example, there might be a timeline of opioid related deaths. But, if they click on a certain date, they would get a graph of how happy / sad the online discourse was at that time, what the major topics were, and more.</p>
        <p>Additionally, we hope to be able to leverage existing data on rehab centers. We want a user to be able to search for centers close to them that have the service that theyâ€™re looking for. Additionally, we would be able to provide google review stars and the major topics of discussion within the reviews.</p>
